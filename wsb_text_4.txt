Can we stop making posts shilling GME non stop I know like 8 million of you know nothing else
I know there’s been like 8 million new people to the sub purely because of the GME short squeeze but this isn’t literally the only thing going on in the market there are tons of other stocks popping off and occasionally here you could find them or at least find something more interesting then you guys begging people to buy more GME and bragging how you bought at the top and are still holding at the bottom
Since hedge funds are apparently searching for the most talk about stock....
Let's find very shitty stocks and dedicate a post to spam them. Eventually they will fuck themselves up if they are using bots....

Some ancient samurai wisdom for my fellow
Read the original quote below, then read it again but replace "samuari" with "diamond hands" and equate death with loss of tendies  "The Way of the Samurai is found in death. Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears, and swords. Being carried away by surging waves. Being thrown into the midst of a great fire. Being struck by lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake. Falling from thousand-foot cliffs, dying of disease, or committing seppuku at the death of one's master. And every day, without fail, one should consider himself as dead. This is the substance of the Way of the Samurai."  300 club, almost at -80% down. I ain't sellin!
This bitch is just teasing my $  buy order
I wish it would either tank low enough to hit my order, or just blast off already
YOLO calls trade
YOLO trade for Pacific Bioscience from ARKG
(Serious Question): Who keeps track of how many shares there are to buy of a certain stock?
I mean it's not limitless, right?  There is only a certain amount of shares available to buy.  With all of the different brokers doing millions (billions?) of transactions daily, who keeps track of the total shares of stocks being sold for a particular company?
So WSB big profit takers, when are you going to tell the subreddit what’s going on?
What a historical movement, easy to blame the restrictions brokerages made for a day on the downfall but the only way a share can plummet is if you start taking profits. Everyone who took profits, who plummeted the share to $65 are you going to get on here and let everyone who’s new to the sub and the market know why they’re losing all their savings and you’re up $100,000? Are you gunna tell them you didn’t “hold the line”probably not guys so I will. Those versed in the market understood from day one that only a group of people will get out of this with profits or break even. The first ones to profit take, make the most profit and then down the intrinsic spiral it goes. For those of you hanging on at $65 you’re nearing the end of the spiral and you’re likely down thousands and the only way to get GME back up & get your money back is to start another movement to pump money into it like we saw at the start. So if you don’t see that happening don’t be the fool. Clearly many before you have sold and left GME behind.  foot note edit: I never was in GME, watched from the sidelines and it was amazing everything it stood for, now the comments in this post  are “it’s not a team movement” “you have to be smart” “I don’t care about strangers losing money” “you’re in the wrong sub” I’ve been in the sub for years on multiple accounts. I didn’t lose money on GME i never got in for this reason.   I’m just amazed how much you sound like the hedge funds, you’re happy to get on here and spam diamond hands comments and hold the line         all week and then start selling your calls and moving them into puts. Lots of people are affected by this smoke and mirrors bullshit. rWSB king of pump and dumps. The   slogan was “hold the line” worked out well for those who have been trading for years. Always does.
GME long term rebound potential - the most entertaining outcome
"The most entertaining outcome is the most likely." - Papa Musk  This is not financial advice, I just made this up with my primitive ape brain. This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.  I am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let's see where this goes. This is what I'm dubbing the "Planet of the Apes" theory.  The case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.  Long Rant: So there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn't be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.  One of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I'm still holding and waiting. I'm not a fanboy, I've made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn't happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.  ✊✊   We all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He's done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that's why he's so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn't been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it's fair to say he likes the stock.  Now let's compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $  BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I'm more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.  Now of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn't matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.  What does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past.   TLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I'm actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story. Holding GME 25 shares avg cost $198.     🌕🌖🌗🌘 🌒🌓🌔🌕
Help need more GME
Need funds for more GME Used 95% of my bank account on gme cause bug balls, but I need more. pls help
What are the chances of a price rebound for GME? Wouldn't lost interest from retailers mean that the squeeze has a much less chance of happening?
Exactly that! Does anyone have any concrete arguments for a chance of the price still going up after some time??  # 16@267 🤲 🤲 🤲
To all the people who sold and called themselves diamond hands
Y’all just paper handers. If it goes down to cents I’m just gonna buy more to fuck with the institutions, and make it harder for them to cover, especially with the rumour with the SI being higher than in Jan (makes sense considering that they probably smelt blood in the water at the $300-400 range).  After all the posting about having   🏻 and shit y’all just paper handed and pussied out to the HFs.  ————————  For all y’all who can’t afford to lose the money and lost from paper hands, you’re in the wrong fucking sub and you lost it on GME because you’re retarded. This is WALL STREET BETS not WALL STREET PUMP AND DUMP.  For all those who CAN afford to lose the money, y’all just a bunch of pussies who were scared off by the HFs.  ————————  We might be losing atm to the hedge funds, but pls fucking drive it down to dollars or hopefully cents, then let us, the real   🏻 diamond hands to fucking buy it for a value play.   Cohen beat amazon on fucking dog food, I’m sure he can do well with fucking video games.  The whole fucking planet knows about GameStop now, this whole debacle gave GameStop incredible amounts of advertising and PR that they would have to spend to get their name out there.  —————————  So please, remember to tell your wife boyfriend’s kids that you’re fucking paper hands and you let the real diamond handers handle this.  TLDR: just fucking sell and let us diamond hands   🏻 buy it cheap thanks.  Totally ok to buy in more to hold it for another 10 years for some actual GameStop growth with the publicity. I doubt there’s a squeeze coming at all.  —————————  Easy value play at $15 and under. So much free publicity they’re never gonna go out of business. Especially not with Wall Street’s darling running the helm.  No need for rockets, just need some deep fucking value.  Not financial advice obv, you retard. I eat crayons.

I get it, GME to the moon   but what the hell happened to NOK and BB?
For me personally, before all of this craziness started happening my safety long-term plays were $NOK and $BB. Everyone told me it was a silly investment and that I should have driven my focus elsewhere at the time (this is when $GME was still trading under 50$) and I told them this was MY deep value play.   Fast forward a few weeks and now everyone is riding this GME rocket and fighting the good fight (including me), but my safety’s are memes too now. This has caused a MASSIVE loss to not just me but a lot of people who took the time to do their DD on these two companies that got grouped together with the memes.   How in the fuck is it fair to have cracked down on two companies that have solid grounds to become waaay more than we ever thought now that we’re entering a new age of technology?   This is ridiculous and I’m truly peeved today to see the losses on companies that deserve more praise and value given what they’re putting out their and currently working on. $NOK is dropping at an accelerated rate and no one gives a fuck, even as they’re progressing in earning and making real moves to be worth more than this tug and pull has allowed them to be.   Listen or not, I’m frustrated and BB/NOK deserve better than what these HF are doing to all of us.   Obligatory:
Holding isn't enough
If you can afford it, just keep dollar cost averaging down. It 1) means you'll be in profit sooner when the stock goes higher and 2) you're combating the manipulation and 3) I LIKE THE DAMN STOCK!!    At the current levels, every $10 it goes down, I just buy more shares.
The GME squeeze is over. This place is becoming a cult. Please stop throwing your money away and try to learn a lesson from this.
I’ve been a long time lurker in this sub. It used to be very different from what it is now. If you’re buying into what’s being spread here now, understand that you’re being taken advantage of.   The GME short squeeze was legitimate. It happened. The share price skyrocketed from $15 to $400 a share in a matter of weeks. People who got in early enough made money. People who jumped on late have only lost money. Period. The share price is in free-fall and that’s not going to change. The share price is NOT going to spike back up again. The squeeze is over. It’s been over.   I’m just looking out for the tons of new users here who have gambled more than they’re able to lose. You’re going to lose almost all of it.   If you cannot afford to lose 80% of your investment, sell. Sell and cap your losses then take the time and effort required to learn more about legitimate investing in the future.   I’m sure I’m about to be bombarded by people calling me a bot. I’m not a bot. I’ve been an active redditor for more than 8 years.   Sell, lick your wounds, and move on.
imagine not buying a Ferrari at $7
thats what you are doing when you are not buying AMC right now, keep buying and we will get that Ferrari, too the moon boyz!

The Big Short or The Social Dilemma? The apps made the bank
Forget the loveable faces of Steve Carrey and Christian Bale. This movie is going to look like the Social Dilemma. These apps that we thought gave us power outplayed us to become the tool. Ever tried to get a loan at 5/10/20 to 1? investment? Its not happening within 2 minutes of installing an app unless you have a much higher than average credit line. These apps empowered by social media push a stock that is at a peak. GME in this case as 250-350.   People who have no idea downloaded the apps and filled in some basic information. Once they deposit 5/10/20% the cost of a share they can buy one. So they buy GME because thats the buzz and thats why they downloaded the app to the moon! Once GME falls below their margin value they will have their position closed.   They have become a machine to pay for shorts by buying a higher share and being force to close at a lower value. But why would they restrict shares if they they wanted you to buy them so they could sell them cheaper to the hedge fund they were in bed with? Because it kills the momentum. They did that exactly after peak media hype.
Hold the goddamn motherfucking line
I’m new to this group, but brothers now is not the time for being panicky bitches and paper handed cunts.  Hold the goddamn line.  The people are stronger than the system.  Money is money. This is a statement.  This is the legacy of all of us ape retards.  Future generations will tell tales of this day when r/wallstreetbets stood against Wall Street giants and refused to sell. Why? Cause fuck em all that’s why!  Will you live forever?? YOLO!  GME 🤲🏻  🌕.
AMC: Am I a Joke to You?
Keep in mind that the current WSB bot tactic is to make topics about GME and completely exclude AMC from the equation. That is because AMC is cheaper to buy into, thus being the hedge funders weaker link.  Do not exclude one over the other, buy and hold both!
GME and AMC same pattern?
Is it strange that GME and AMC seem to be following almost exactly the same pattern of dips and rises? They're not identical however veeeeery similar
My GME journey, hope it inspires some of you to hold on tight, and have no regrets.
I was in 'relatively' early compared to some of the comrades in here. I entered around $17 last November, held through the December earnings call, and watch my shares take a dive to $12. Did people say then that the squeeze has already happened? Yes. Because people like the lord DFV himself bought at $3 or something so everyone assumed GME had has its run, and people are selling out, squeeze aint going to happen anymore. Did I sell? No.   I held and held, and for what it seemed like an eternity, the price started to creep up and by pre-xmas I broke even.   Over the last week or so, I held through almost 43k profit, and watched it tumble down to where it is now. Are the naysayers trying to convince everyone the squeeze has happened again? Yes. Did I sell? No.   I have full faith that $500 is not even close to the highest we can squeeze out of these corrupted HFs, and I hope those who are still holding now but tempted to sell for what meager profits/losses re-consider, because you don't want to look back in a few days/weeks time and see everyone else celebrate our early retirement gains.   So I will leave you with this question.  Later in your life, when you meet your new wife/husband, or have kids and they ask you 'Did you sell?' What would you want to tell them?   (Obviously sell at some point but if that point for you is now, then you should have never gotten in in the first place).   This is not financial advice, just LOVE THIS STOCK!  Edit:  I wasn't expecting many to read this post, but since it's getting some attention, I would encourage all holders, old or new to share their story to give some hope to everyone else.
Just a friendly reminder. Many of you bought some “experience” over the recent weeks. One day, you’ll be the man on the other side of the equation...

Reminding you all about HCMC.
So in all this mess people have lost site of HCMC. Its a stock that has had an up of 59%. That is bound to go up more near the end of the month with the pending copy right infringement case against Phillip Morris at the end of the month (Phillip Morris has to respond by the 02/26).  Take some pennies to the moon. Not financial advice Can't lose on GME if you don't sell.
A Letter to WSB: y'all need a sandwich
Hey guys, back in November I learned about options for the first time and got super lucky. During the peak I was up to $184k (thank you Mr Musk). The process took about 5 weeks. Every day it would go up and down and up and down and everyone and their mothers screamed in my ear to sell.   "17k in profit? Omg take the money and run."  "Jesus christ really? You can just take that money out? Right now? 33k? For real?"  "Dude bullshit that app is fake my cousin uses that. You did not make 67k." (Talking about RH, lol)  "82k? No fucking way."  "Dude, you did it, 112k, just sell already. You made it."  I know I don't have to tell you guys what it's like to be on high alert. Not sleeping good. Generally anxious. Forgetting to eat. I was like this for 5 weeks. I went from making 22k per year to 20k per day and I was so anxious and manic I was ready to snap from all the pressure.  And that was when I was clearly ahead. Right now with GME, it feels almost the same as when I was ahead with tesla.  I made myself a sandwich in the haze of the blending days of sleep deprivation. I was between rounds of simultaneously shopping for a house and a car. I was so fucking delirious.  I made a ham sandwich. Took a bite, and it was the best thing I've ever tasted. I calmed way the fuck down after that. Drank a bunch of water and went on a walk. A few weeks later RH fucked me and I lost all but 18k. When I learned the news I laughed about it. It hurt but not nearly as bad as I thought it would.  The key to all this emotion and stress is to take yourself off high alert. Drink some water, go for a walk, eat a sandwich. Just try to actively disconnect for an hour and process.  Tl;dr make yourself a sammich.
to those who have lost a lot on their GME trade: here's why you should buy more
if you're like me and you're fucking stupid and decided to buy in high, you're probably thinking of selling now looking at that sweet -78% in your portfolio. i'm in 2 @380. can't even look at it anymore.      but if you're decided that this is going to be more than a money bath that teaches you something and instead a trade that teaches you nothing, here's why you should buy more right now.      1. it's cheap as dog shit right now. besides the fact that the stock is great and i like it there is always the possibility of a second squeeze, especially with how much is still shorted.  2. robinhood decided that now they can play fair and are letting retail buy up to 500 shares 3. most importantly, you can hedge your losses using cheap shares.  assuming you bought at the ridiculous price of 380: if you were to do nothing and GME were to go up to 230, congrats, you're now down ~40%. not much better. but if you were to buy an equal number of shares at 80 as you bought at 380: going up to 230 has you break even. moreover, you've now got more shares than you started with, so each dollar above 230 is two (or however many shares) dollars of profit to you. hedge your bets with more cheap GME! if you were to buy double your original shit investment, it would only have to go up to 155 for you to break even. assuming GME goes up from here, which i think it will because the floor of diamond hands seems to be ~80, you can find ways to profit even if you're losing on your initial trade.
New investor and what I’ve learned these last 2 months.
Hello! I would like to take a moment to say thank you to all the new information, sources and insight given by everyone here. Secondly I’m new to active trading and stocks other than dropping money in and never looking into it.  I’m new to WSB, Reddit (I just looked at Jeep stuff before WSB) and I actually got into really applying my money into stocks for long term investments in 2018. October 2019 I decided to make allotments to have reoccurring investments. So much to speak that I’ve built a “portfolio” and was up and down day after day. Never paid attention. In December 2020 is when the idea of “my money make money for me” came to me and I tried. Few weeks later this GME thing hit and I made some very “emotional calls” mixed with FOMO.   With those calls came MANY lessons. Some takeaways to all my fellow new investors that I’ve learned and I hope people can learn from my mistakes without going through:   A.) Never invest/gamble/stock play with what you cannot afford to lose. This goes without saying.   B.) A loss is only a loss if you look at it in such a manner. Where you have a loss there’s a learning lesson and as boomer as it sounds with knowledge comes power; the power to take past mistakes and fool proof your future plans.   C.) The stock market is a vicious and volatile area and money can be made as fast as lost. It IS possible to recover, learn how, do your DD.   C1.) The stock market is not for everyone. Short term investments with high hopes of a fast bucks can become a long term ordeal that you may or may not be ready to handle.   D.) Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.   These are just some key points I’ve jotted down on my notes to myself and as I said, If even one young investor can pick something from this and benefit  from my mistake then it’s worth it.   Thanks for your time!   Edit: not a financial advisor just sharing my experiences so far.   Edit2: 10 shares in at 209 ea. Still holding for some reason, I think just for the principle of the initial idea other than make tendies.
Can we just level set for a moment on GME?
So I'm a fucking moron, but...  The whole way that this play is setup is that the hedge funds shorted the stock and at some point they'll get margin calls.  When they do this, the supply will be limited cause of us morons and then when they buy the price will need to go up cause of limited supply.  ISN"T THAT THE FUCKING DEAL?  SO we just need to wait until the margin calls come.  Correct me where I'm wrong.  Edit:  Maybe I'm just desparate, but look at Volkswagon from 2008:    The squeeze there started 8/1/2008 and ENDED 10/1/2008  It took two fucking months
[Motivation] the concept has been proven - this will never be over, there is no going back now
Whatever you're doing right now, holding or watching from a distance cuz you're broke (me) then it doesn't matter. What matters has already been done - YOU the people caused a hedge fund to collapse, taking back capital for yourselves and scaring the fuck out of the ruling class. Response was swift; they do not want you doing this. But you did, and it can be done again, and they know it.  Whatever happens to GME happens. The fight isn't over but the battle has been won and it is glorious. The war is just beginning though; resist any legal measures that attempt to restrict your access to trading services by any means necessary. This needs to happen to stock after stock. This momentum cannot and must not fall off, there can be no return to the status quo. We know what can be done now, how much power we all collectively have and how genuinely scared the elites were at the slightest sign of financial threat.  Love you all. It's more than just gamestop now. Never forget the bigger picture and the significance of these events in relation to our material conditions.
Here's why I'm   least until Tuesday
Just a disclaimer: I'm not a financial expert and all the following information is my opinion and for entertainment purposes only.  Briefly: I'm holding because the short interest information that's out there is scattered all over the place and we just don't know what the ACTUAL short interest in GME and AMC are.  According to FINRA, the next short interest report is on Tuesday, Feb 9th ( . That means, Tuesday we'll have a clearer image of the truth behind hedgefund claims they've exited all their positions. Everyone has been speculating that the same or other hedgefunds have been upping their short positions which means, it's possible the squeeze is still to squoze. Nobody really knows and anyone claiming to know is lying to themselves and others.  Obligatory: GME 30 shares at $ , AMC 300 shares at $
SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND HANDED MOTHERFUCKERS
The hype train was real last week, we caught them with their pants down and we'll never know what could have been if they didn't illegally restrict buying. Buying restrictions then went worldwide, and now they are lifting restrictions but limiting how much we can buy on most apps. The fact of the matter remains, though... we had them on the ropes and they are doing EVERYTHING they can now to keep us from making them lose more money and us potentially make a ton of money when  .   We are seeing something that hasn't happened before; stop expecting a steady, profitable incline until blastoff like we thought might happen last week. We are in uncharted territory. This is a war where we are going to win and lose some battles. But we hold the fucking line because we're all in this together.    I'm not a financial advisor, I just like the stock
AMC : Holding and relaxing!
\+-500shares AMC @ 13     Still holding and relaxing!     What's the point on selling and losing money?     a) If i sell i'll lose money.   b) If i hold and we win i'll make money fast.   c) If i hold and we lose i'll make money in a few months when the theaters go back to business.     I don't know about you, but i don't like a) ...     I'm just another retarded ape like you guys, don't know shit about this things and i'm not giving anyone financial advice, it's your money. you do what you want with it...     But i'm not going to sell and flush my money down the toilet...     🤲🏻
Who is still holding GME?
I m not leaving and I just bought more at 66 from Hong Kong. I am losing money but I want to be part of the history.
Wash Sale Question
I understand that if you take a loss you must wait 30 days to buy that same stock if you want the losses to be deducted from your income.  In my current GME situation I sold 120 shares for a 40k gain. I then bought 164 shares. If I sell these shares for a loss those losses will still be deducted from my income right?
A sense of perspective
All these bots saying its going to go to 0 are melvin simps. Its not the intrinsic value before the shorts and the DFV info was $30 now with all the free advertising, New board and "goodwill" the realistic intrinsic value has to be raised to $35-40. Back of my hand numbers but you get the point.  I don't care what you bought at. The current price is $70, so your down side is $30 a share. However if the short information is correct (and we will see on the updated numbers fairly soon) there WILL be another gamma squeeze so the price is likely going to hit the highs we saw last week again so $450+. We can also have the upside of the short squeeze, which can go way higher.  So there is literally no point paper handing at this point. All you are doing is making gamma and short squeezes less likely. The upside (390 on a gamma way more on a short squeeze) vs downside (30 now) is massively in our favour! So even if you think there is 10% chance of it happening its a good bet.   DFV and all the apes (which I am one) knows this and is still holding, I trust him more than some bots! If anything the bots just show how desperate the hedge funds are, Think about it, if they had covered why would they care whats happening now.   Mr/Mrs/Attack Helicopter/Prefer not to say SEC Intern this is not financial advice this is random mumbling from a smooth brain.   So keep  🤲!   Tldr:    =            🤖= 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
So, how's that GME going? Lmfao. Share your losses below.
69% down ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Hold the focking line m8!
The reason GME is NOT DEAD!!
First off, 93@100 here - so diamond hands this brothers!!  Now - As far as I can see, there are lots of people asking questions and wondering about buying GME, what brokerages to use, etc.  Even if only half of these folks would eventually become a full-blown ape and buy some GME, we are most likely to see an increase in GME's price and a second wave of interest from the media, social media and what not.  DIAMOND HANDS APES!!!
We passed the moon and are heading to that place in the pic. Seems awesome! 🔻 Can't stop🔻 Won't stop🔻GameStop🔻 It's all about the cause and staying broke! 💸 🤲 💸
Alright, you retards, I'm in.
Let's do this. $1500 on GME @ 68. Holding to the moon.  Fuck Citadel, fuck the SEC, and fuck the billionaires.  I finally decided to pull the trigger on this when I saw a CNBC segment that was clearly an advertisement for the hedge funds. I tried to buy on the day RH locked buy orders, moved all my money to Fidelity, and have been waiting to see what happens... screw it.  I'll either see this stock rise like hell or I'll march hand-in-hand when we hit the streets to protest this corrupt system.  EDIT:    EDIT 2:
I sold and honestly I feel much better
this shit was ruining my mental health. I’m really sorry guys that I couldn’t hold like you but I’ve had a sick feeling in my stomach for the last few days and the moment I sold I felt instantly better.  It’s not worth fucking up for your mental health for the meme stocks or for “fucking over the hedge funds”   I wish you all the best especially those holding. And for those of you who already sold don’t feel bad
Broke ape buying the dip +1 GME
At 7 shares now cause that’s literally everything I can afford, holding/buying till 0 don’t care, watch these hands become   🤚
Legit question...
Soooo im really trying to figure out, besides market manipulation, how GME and AMC can make virtually the same moves for the past 3 days. The charts look basically identical. Does any smoothbrained apes have any guesses?
What are you guys glum about? This is the perfect time to buy.
Mmmmm, yummy cheap GME. Gotta buy sommore of that. They wanna lower the price? Great, gives me some room to buy more GME.
This is the moment that will separate the dumb from the truly retarded.
It’s not just about holding your shares. It’s about holding your principles. It’s about bolting out into the freezing rain butt naked and swallowing fistfuls of soil. It’s about being who Master Chief wants you to be. It’s about what you’ll tell your wife’s boyfriend’s grandchildren when they ask where you were at the beginning of the new era. We view the Restoration as a period of triumph, but even that will pale in contrast to how future generations will look back upon the Retardation.   I just bought another ten GME.
How many of you remember gamestop in its limelight?
How many of you remember visiting gamestop as a child, a teenager, or a young adult? All of us enjoyed the experience of exploring all the new videogames we wanted.     Who among us remembers the release of Halo 3 and how GameStop was there for us? Who among us gets an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia when remembering trading in that video game for $5 and $15 of in-store credit?       Who among us whishes out children and our children's children to experience the same joy we did?      We are not just squeezing those short selling hedge fund bastards. We are investing in a company that at one point or another brought us joy. A company, that with our collective investment, can once again bring joy to millions of nerds around the US. We have seen it already. The hiring of those three wisemen from the west (I'm assuming they're from silicone valley) marks a turning point in GameStops story. To me it's future looks bright. In my opinion. Just saying.
Too many 6’s
Lot of blame on us. Something fishy is going on. HOLD MY FELLOW PRIMATES.  👏 ps I am not a financial advisor
Is this real? I’m all for it, but...
Look on the bright-side
You might have lost all of your savings but someone else made money cause of you. That brings a little smile to my face when I think about it. Just wanted to share with you fellas.
GME sentiment
It's very interesting to see the sentiment shift so violently and quickly in this sub. We said last week to prepare for dips and flat days and to hold for as long as it takes, even if it's until March.  Now that we can see that we're actually right, people are jumping ship and bashing the GME holders and saying it's a cult. Don't be mad at us for holding just cuz you paperhanded your one share. Fellow GME bagholders, we'll be flying high one day and we'll just have to hold until then.            My positions:   shares at 128 avg
What does AMC's volume trend mean and why is it so so low? Peak volume was   on 1/27. Today it's 87M.
What's going on here? Is this a good indication of longs holding? Seems like it to me. Not financial advice just looking for quality explanation and/ or discussion.  Edit: Even with recent trading restrictions these numbers seem suspiciously disconnected.
Volume ~30% of average
What’s that indicate? Other than us apes staying strong?   I’m a simple retard, but does that mean these short ladder attacks are still ongoing?
In all honesty, what market cap do you think Gamestop belongs at?
Current valuation is at $  From 2016 up to the time WSB started its war against the Hedges, the valuation of the company reached max ~$3B.  The peak of the $450 pump, valuation of Gamestop was $24B which is like 5x bigger than 5 previous years. Now the recent 5 years might be wrong to look at since it was when gaming retail shops struggled with sinking game sales, but I think its interesting to compare anyway to become a little anchored to reality   So in all honesty, what valuation does Gamestop belong to at this point or in the future? I think that is a good thing to think about before people go all crazy on the stock.

FINRA Short Volume 15 Jan - 3 Feb
IM NOT SMART THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE    I aggregated the short volume (normal + exempted), in millions of shares, from here     And plotted the price as well.  I estimate the   average entry price   for a   new short position   during this time frame is roughly   122 USD  .  The units on the x axis are trading days since the 15th of Jan. Last timepoint is yday. This data only includes trades within market hours.  !!!   !!!    BLUE = new shorts/day IN MILLIONS      RED = total volume/day IN MILLIONS      YELLOW = price IN DOLLAROOS    The total number of short volume in the period 15 Jan - 3 Feb is around 202 million shares, while the total non-short (  normal shares) volume is 300 million shares.       INTERPRET HOW YOU LIKE       THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE
Look don’t judge me I’m broke this is all I can afford to invest. Do I sell or should I keep holding AMC
I now no longer have 500 shares...
BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT 750 MORE FOR $50k!  Had to take out a credit loan on 15% but it’ll be ok when I make triple my investment and then some   WE’RE GOING TO THE MOON BABYYYYYYY        🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑💰💰💰💰💰💰💰  Edit:
Bragging about losses here and buying into the whole “I’m a retard and will hold to $0” literally is what the hedge funds want...
Honestly at this point I’m pretty sure it’s hedge fund cronies who post here all the time “bragging about their losses but still holding the line.”  Like who do u think benefits when you buy a ton of stock at $300 and hold until $30? Hint: it ain’t the small guys. And there’s a phenomenon here where people brag about losing money like it’s cool. If I was a hedge fund shithead, I’d literally be doing exactly what you see here and get a bunch of retail investors to think losing money was cool.
Look apes...
You're invested money is notional, it's easy to see red and panic, but you've only lost the money if you actually sell, which is what the hedgies want... No    if you give up, blast off requires

Why holding makes sense
If you need the money you shouldn’t have bought into a gamble in the first place you asshat. Sell if you need it now.  If you can afford it:  ###- best case scenario:  turn this into an investment, GME is undervalued. A lot of well done DD indicates so, so it’s a relatively safe bet, it was before this whole squeeze debacle.  ###- less than best case scenario:  selling down the line when the price stabilizes you might lose less than now. It’s highly unlikely it will drop even lower than at start, logically way more people are aware of this stock now than before and the company is clearly using this opportunity to try and make a turnaround.  ###- worst case scenario: if you bought at the peak, hold: to remind yourself why you shouldn’t buy at peaks you dumbass. And at least out of  solidarity help those who are holding too.  ##DISCLAIMER: ###This is NOT in any way shape or form financial advice, I sniff glue, run with scissors, and rub my eyes with glitter.
What’s going to turn this around? (GME)
Can someone explain how we are going to get out of this continuous decrease in GME Share price?
That was one of the greatest short squeezes of all time.
Where to go to find the truth on short positions?
I have been seeing a ton of articles how Melvin and Citadel have closed their short positions on GME. From the info I have seen on WSB, I think this is a lie. Anyone got any good sources that may be able to shed light on whether these guys have covered their shorts or not?

Don't sweat the paper handers leaving.
If I were the whales right now that weren't part of the original short, I'd notice that there hasn't been an 82 million share sell off and, by waiting for everyone else to get out who's going to, I can optimize the amount of shares bought for that last spike that fully bankrupts everyone. Not to mention, it makes it more likely for all the retailers to buy back in once it starts happening since the stock has gotten to its lowest point. This in turn will trigger the sell off because things can only get worse for the shorts from there.     This is just my opinion. Not advice. I have risked what I am willing to lose, and my faith in what all of this means is something I've earned instead of just bought into.
This is not the end!
This is far from over... For those of you that purchased at the peak, do yourself a favor and buy while its low to lower your average costs. That way if this doesn't spike to the moon due to the market manipulation, you at least have a chance to make some money back. I'm still buying and holding.    Don't listen to the people who see a few days of red and shit themselves.
Petition to Address Ladder Attacks (based on a post by /u/SenateMajorityLeader)
Burnout.
Burnout.  We’re all tired, the war has been difficult brothers. I’ve been buying everyday and will proceed to. Maybe I’m retarded, maybe I’m one of the few left, maybe I love losing. I’m tired but I’m still   strong. Stimmy check coming tomorrow, it ain’t much but it’s honest work. Going out fighting. Love you all, autists, apes and everyone who don’t have paper hands. Learnt what diamond hands meant. Even if we don’t make money, we accomplished something, we exposed manipulation. Diamond hands if you can afford to lose it all. If you can’t this isn’t for you.
You have the illuminati on your side. STAY STRONG!
Listen up retards, if the world's largest asset management firm doubled their stake in AMC and HOLD then so can you. Do you guys honestly think a little bitch like Melvin has a chance versus the big dick Blackrock that's more than 830x their net worth? STOP getting distracted by the bots who ask you to pump big cap stocks with little to no short interest trapping you for nothing. STICK to AMC and GME or the division will cause this movement to fail. BUY AND HOLD.
How do brokerages account for sell volume?
When a share is shorted, the first thing that happens is that the short seller borrows the shares and immediately sells at the market price. Sometime later the share is bought back and returned and the short seller pockets the difference.   My question is this, when shares are shorted and the share is immediately sold at the current market price, does the brokerage count this as a sell on their volume reports immediately following the short sale or do they record the sell when the shares are returned? Thanks guys, any insight will be appreciated.
I’m long GME but had anybody considered that AMC and GME have the same market for investors
They have the same idea and same investors like yeah they’re going to move the same lol.   May get banned
You're an idiot if you don't have some WKHS in your stable
Positions: 55 shares @ $  (Not a big position, but whatever, it's what I could afford.)  The Low-Down:  Workhorse ($WKHS) is an EV commercial truck manufacturer primed to moon. They're one of the finalists for the $6 billion USPS contract to replace the old, outdated postal trucks with shiny, new, sexy trucks. This contract was supposed to be awarded in December but got delayed. We can expect the results within the next month.  The two other finalists are Karsan, a truck manufacturer from TURKEY and OshKosh/Ford who are putting up an ICE truck (but have said they could pivot to an EV if required).  Now, the contract itself isn't for an EV truck however adding fuel to the fire (acid to the battery?) in support of WKHS is that Biden wants the entire federal fleet to be zero emission. This is great news.  Also, WKHS is based in Ohio, American made and a union company. If your pecker isn't half chubbed and saluting at those words, then honestly you're a pinko commie un-Murrican bastard. And you can bet your ass that is being factored into the decision as to who to award. You really think that they're going to give this money to the Turks? No, this administration knows it has to pay at least lip service to American manufacturing and union support. And honestly, as Americans, that's shit that we should be supporting, too.  Their debt is around 70 million right now, which pales in comparison to the money they'll be getting if (when) they get the USPS contract.  EDIT: Oh yeah, and their short interest (SI) is around 27%, which you idiots who got spoiled @ >100% may scoff at, but is still pretty high in the normal world.  TL;DR - Don't be an idiot and sleep and WKHS. It's a great long-term play but I also believe it has potential for healthy short term gains.  EDIT 2: To put forth the other argument for why the OshKosh/Ford truck could beat out WKHS, so you see the other side of the argument: both OshKosh and Ford already have their tenterhooks in the government and definitely could win the contract. Also, as an astute person pointed out: the USPS currently doesn't have the infrastructure to support a full EV fleet, meaning that OshKosh/Ford's offering may be an easier transition.   However, I don't think these necessarily weaken WKHS's position at all. Granted, I could be putting WAY too much stock in a cynical/political POV with this, but the way that I see it is that the contract is going to be 'weaponized' to be about more than just replacing the aged USPS fleet and will instead be something to tout as a green victory for the administration. Which I believe is overall a great step in the right direction and something we all should be happy about but let's be honest: decision makers understand optics and a PR release that says "USPS moving their entire fleet to 0 emissions" will play a lot better than "USPS adopts new truck. Plans to move to 0 emissions by 2030"
Late to the party, but I’m in
I’m broke, and I’m late to the party. But I just bought 2 shares on the dip. Holding to the moon. I just really like the stock.  Also, I threw out all of the toilet paper in my house. I’m only wiping my ass with    until this bitch is in outer space.   None of that    Portnoy ass shit
I'm still new to this but I think I did 4 things righ IMO
The money I spent was money I definitely not rely on        Didn't buy on a margin (I'm mean really.. wtf is wrong with you)        Have been fully aware that I could lose all of my money        Didn't tell anyone about it (this turns out to be one of the best things)
I hate Gamestop, but I hate the hedge funds more. Why I hold:
I used to work at a Gamestop. Honestly, their poor customer service, employee culture and compensation, and failure to adapt to a growing digital marketplace are just a few of the reasons why the company is in the position it is today. From my experience as a long time customer and former employee, I wouldn't be saddened or surprised if they went under.  That being said, I bought stock in GME and AMC everyday since the 26th and I plan on holding. Not only is there potential for thick gains, but it is a chance to stick it too the financial elite AND profit from a shitty company that didn't do right by its staff or customers.  Now a lot of the loss porn and position posts on here don't reflect the situations of the Average Joe. I, like many other hopeful retards on here  don't have  $60k to throw at a stock just because   "lol diamond hands ape togehter stronk",      You have to take more calculated risks and assess what is right for your situation and your wallet.    Even with the falling prices, media hailstorm, and fear setting in; I remember something that Warren Buffet said,    "Wall Street is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient"   . I hold because I have seen investments climb out of a trench and net me profits, but don't let anyone tell you what is the right thing to do.    - Never invest (gamble) more than you are comfortable losing      - Know when to walk away from the table (take a break and come back)      - Fast money is fleeting and unreliable, be patient and do your DD      - Selling is not a weak move, your morals don't have to align with this subs. Your wallet and wellbeing is the biggest motivating factor.    Good luck, let's make some money together.   THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS IS A PERSONAL ANECDOTE.
Stop panic selling.
You’re only losing and making the rest of us fucking lose because of your shit paper hands. You only fucking lose if you sell.

CureVac - Vaccine Printer Go BRRRRR
Alright you retards, this subreddit seems to have become a place for $GME and nothing else lately, but since all the new autists arriving here have probably been losing their tendies on gamestonks, I thought I'd try giving some actual DD so people can make money instead of losing it.  So what's the play?  $CVAC, currently trading at around $  a share, with a market cap of    They're in phase 3 trials of their covid vaccine right now and have been signing deals left and right, such as:           I'm expecting phase 3 trial results from them early next month, mostly based on this, which has the trial set to conclude on March 4th or 5th:     This is earlier than I expected, due to the trials being initiated on December 22nd to my knowledge, but maybe it's accurate?  Anyways, if any of you have followed Novavax ($NVAX), their stock price went to the moon a few days ago when they announced that their vaccine worked, and I'm anticipating a similar large move in $CVAC if their vaccine works.  From what I've read about their phase 1 and 2 results, and seeing large deals being signed each week now for distribution, I'm expecting phase 3 results to show that the vaccine works.  Now there is a counterargument to this, mainly that they already have a higher market cap than $NVAX, will be able to produce less of their vaccine, and their vaccine will have most likely have lower efficacy than $NVAX:  .  Also obviously their vaccine might not work, but I don't think this is likely.  However, I am of the belief that they will exceed these delivery numbers and may engage in more partnerships to produce their vaccine candidate once it is proven to be effective.  Additionally, DADDY MUSK is in their corner, with Tesla having partnered with CureVac to develop mRNA printers capable of printing multiple different vaccines:    When their phase 3 trial results are published and they shoot up like $NVAX printing tendies for all you're gonna be salty you didn't get in on that sweet action.  Positions: I hold calls for March 21 as well as shares, if you wanna be safer with guessing when their phase 3 results will be out maybe go for April 21 calls.  I'm poor so I don't have that many calls or shares, and I also lose money a lot so maybe this DD sucks.  If the SEC is watching, this is not financial advice, just my retarded DD  TLDR: Vaccine printer go BRRRR when they announce their vaccine candidate phase 3 trial was successful, likely early next month.
17 shares of AMC
I bought 4 more, im not here for the meme. Im not here for the apes. Im not here for the autistic movement. Im not here for the GME. Im not here for silver.  Im not here for BB. Im HERE FOR AMC YOU FUCKS GET IT STRAIGHT LETS SEE JOHN WICK 9 TOGETHER?!
We only need to hold for another 5 days!
This is just my opinion, not advice.   Once the numbers come out on the 9th, we'll know if we have any chances at all. For those worried about how long this is going to last, at least hold on until then! If we can keep the momentum going for the next week, that's all we need to beat this situation! You don't have to choose between    and 💰💰. Personally, I'm not reconsidering until then, and I came in at 293$ like an idiot.  I'm Canadian but I have a fondness for EB Games and will be holding some stock into eternity no matter what!
It will not lose value
1 share is 1 share. Only time i ever lost is when i sold too early. If you don't need the money, keep the stock and wait until gme is the digital juggernaut it might eventually become. Just lay off the news. Set an alarm or something for when it reaches your target and stop then. Perhaps in a week perhaps in a few years. We've got time.
How I think this will all play out (Diamond Hands!)
My Prediction: Diamond hands, GME, and HFers will come out of this okay, at the expense of paperhands and non WSB retail investors. How will this play out? WSB retailers are now wise to the game: HF and MMs control the price of the stock and the mainstream media. This time, we are in control of the shares. HFs need those shares, but diamond hands aren’t giving them up. So how do the HF’s get them back? By making average cnbnc viewers buy them. But how?  Massive short laddering and FUD   are an obvious ploy at shaking out any paper porn toys they can find. Every paperhand folding now is a cheaper share they need to buy back. Anyone left with skin in the game is gonna be hard to shake off, but HFers aren’t gonna just pay up. How will they get the average retailer to pay up?  There are a massive amount of 3/19 800$ calls that have been purchased. HFers will use this to recover some of their money. One day, between 2/5 and 3/19, GME price will skyrocket from 90-100$ all the way up to 500$, as HFers cover their shorts. Some of us will cash out our investments, and leave a few shares to speculate, others will fully cash out. CNBC and CNN will be screaming from their platforms that the short squeeze has begun, and everyone should pile in and get those sweet gainz. Average retailers will pile on, driving the price up to somewhere between 500-1000. Then, the HFers will ladder the stock down to 100, shaking down new paperhanders for cheap shares. They’ll leave it back at 100 for a few days to see if any other paperhanders walk off. CNN/CNBC will help drive off investor confidence with FUD  . Rinse and repeat. Eventually, HFers will get the shares they need by buying these shares up on the cheap from paperhanding retailers trying to get in on the squeeze, not knowing that HFers and MMs can artificially control the price of the stock through a combination of short laddering and short buybacks. Combined with the 2/5 puts, the 3/19 calls, and the massive swings in price that the HFers can control, they will make all of their money back.  Final outcomes? Diamond hands will make big gains. No way are we getting back in at 500 if we know they can short ladder down to 100. Average retailers will come in and buy shares from diamond hands for 1000$ hoping it will go to 2000$ the next day, only to paperhand them to HFers for 100$. New retailers will flock to WSB to see the massive gains as folks cash out, get greedy, buy in, only to get slaughtered the next day. WSB will be filled with gain and loss porn. GME will come out as a multibillion dollar company with a share value from 100-300, with strong investor confidence. CNBC and CNN will hail WSB as a hallmark moment for the little man that saved GME and will change the game forever.  WSBers will forget about the short ladder attacks, the FUD  , the trade freezing, etc., because hey, we made money right? Anyone who bought in at 500 and held on for dear life will have a chance of getting out. Hell, WSBers will be laughing at the average retail investor that gets slaughtered, because they should have known better, right? A few hedge funds will walk out making massive gains, a few hedge funds will implode, and nothing on wall street will change, except they’ll start taking WSB a lot more seriously. The average retail investor will continue to get screwed by wall street because they don’t know that wall street controls the pricing on stocks.  Bulls make money, Bears make money, Pigs get slaughtered   TLDR: HFers are gonna do everything in their power to make the common retail investor the pig. If we diamond hand this, HFers will find greedy paper hand investors to buy our shares for them.  This is not financial advice, and I am a retard.
GME spike isn't coming back folks. The brokers successfully killed it. Fidelity shows interest rate on shorted stocks has dropped from 30% last week, to just 18% today. Others are also reporting shares availability to borrow has increased. Personally, I'm still gonna hold cuz I've came this far.
I'm like 99% sure I should sell. Meaning, the squeeze has squoze. But I'm gonna hold just cuz its not much left to lose. Unfortunately all the random people popping off with their first time buys and YOLO'd lifesavings are in for some hard lessons. The volume indicates shorts have and are continuing to cover. I hope u/deepfuckingvalue posts some of his DD soon.

FYI “ATC” IPO today, a strong company, lot of potential and room for stock growth (note meme stock)
ATC (Atotech - further description below) is number one in its field by leading all competitors in fundamentals. It just IPO’d today and is a very real stock with great long term and short term growth potential. Current share price is under 20$, and they haven’t released too many stocks into the public market.  (source is their investor prospectus)  I am not a financial advisor, do not take my advice.   “We are the global market leader in both of our primary markets — #1 in EL plating chemistry with a 24% market share and #1 in GMF plating chemistry with a 22% market share. Each market is well structured, with the three largest players in the EL and GMF plating chemistry markets representing a combined 61% and 48% market share, respectively. We are the only comprehensive solutions provider in the industry, and our chemistry is consumed by suppliers serving a majority of the major electronics manufacturers, which we believe limits our exposure to market share shifts. We are a recognized leader in plating processes for applications such as HDI for smartphones, IC substrates, decorative coatings (“DECO”), plating on plastics (“POP”), as well as functional chrome plating and have long-standing relationships with our customers.”
I feel great about GME
I have this intuition that we are guaranteed to land on the moon! We did it right.   It’s in the math, it’s shows in the DD’s and it especially shows on those billionaires faces.   I wake up with a smile on my face cause I woke up on the space ship. It’s a sleepover party in this rocket.   Ohh shoot, I gotta fill add more fuel ⛽️ brb!
Did Elon Musk buy $GME?
Given the fact that he can not explicitly say what he has bought, or is buying, due to his big influence and it potentially being seen as market manipulation: Is it possible his last tweet refers to him putting in a buy order with a broker willing to serve as his squire while he is the retard knight in ape armor that saves us all?  He would absolutely slay the hedgies who shorted GameStop, potentially make a ton of money, he loves video games just as much as the rest of us stupid fucks in here, and it requires the money equivalent of us buying Starbucks.  Does Elon like the stonk?
I'm holding, if for nothing else that it costs hedge funds money.
I don't have a huge vested interests, and only the money I would be ok with if it just disappeared. I genuinely feel bad if in the end this doesn't go well for the people that put in more than they could/should.      But I'm holding. And I plan to hold. Because normal people have been fucked by big business our entire lives. Over and over, with absolutely zero change.    If my tiny portion causes them to lose ANY money then good. Fuck them.   I'm holding.

I know several of you are stressed because of the dip, fuck it! I did the following to keep the morale up:  If I see the   is falling I buy one and then book anther one for $10 less. Today I bought one at $75, then I booked another for $65, , so when I open and saw that the stonk was falling there was part of me excited to get that barging.  Another set for $60 now because I don't think it will fall to $55, but what do I know  I'm just a retard enjoying the game, committed to the cause, and keeping momentum.  Don't listen to all the negativity out there, I'm sure there are several bots trying to create chaos -      United!
YOU HAVENT LOST ANYTHING YET!
You haven’t lost money until you have sold your stocks. SO KEEP FKN HOLD BOIS, TO THE MOON
Just bought 10 GME shares for 550€. It is everything I can spare without fucking my existence.
550€ is a lot of money for me fellow retards but I have to take the opportunity to take my revenge for 2008/2009 when I lost my job and was living at the poverty line. LETS DO THIS!!!!
My first post. Me no financial advisor. Me knows GME goes to visit MoonMoon
I just wanna say...:
Bought 1 share @68
Fuck the solar system, we going to another galaxy!!!!   Not doing it for the money, just wanted to feel like I belonged lol
Chinese investors are laughing at the retards who bought their inflated AMC positions
With 24/7 surveillance Just another reminder there’s no way to sneak tendies into The movie theatre without your social credit score plummeting, thanks CCP🐔👍🏼
Why are you guys crying? Did you piss your pants paper hands? THIS ISN’T A MONEY PLAY ANYMORE, ITS A WORLD WIDE MOVEMENT.  🏾
I love all of you and the amazing things we have done as a community. How we took the world by storm! A fucking sub on Reddit made BILLIONAIRES cry on live tv! We are unstoppable! Especially with Elon (supposedly) joining our team. WE must HOLD. WE are STRONG. APE STRONG SNAKE WEAK. The hedge funds data will come out the 15th and the math will be done. We have MORE than enough time to wait for our gamma squeeze. You will pay for the 08’ crisis and the uncountable amount of people you’ve ruined and fucked over.  edit: YOU BETTER BUY SHARES THEY’RE CHEAP TICKETS TO THE MOON  🌠  Edit 2: yes a gamma squeeze isn’t guaranteed but I can’t read  Edit 3: the hate is unmeasurable but I can’t read  Edit 4: I can’t imagine how sad your guys life are. I can afford to lose my investment LOL broke asses.
So do we know if Melvin is still holding those shorts?
Don't know where to look to find it - but if you can post that up, that'll remove a lot of doubt in the paper hands ppl.
Just a feel good post
I just went to get my wife lunch at Chipotle I was waiting in line to pay and the guy in front of me says to the cashier "I got his". I looked around thinking there was someone behind me and he points to me. I was like "What? You don't have to do that" and he says "No I got it. Someone did it for me the other day and I want to pay it forward".  I was floored. I haven't felt that good in a long time and it kinda brought a tear to my eye. I assured him that I would do the same for someone. I was getting lunch for myself at a different restaurant and I paid for the guy behind me in the drive-thru. Man what a good feeling. There is a lot going on in this world as you all know. Covid, these dumb stocks, stupid people causing riots and on and on and on. You never know what kind of day someone is having or what they are going through. I'm an out of work drummer thanks to covid but luckily my wife does pretty good so we are ok. But there are a lot of people down on their luck right now. I often think of the people who have yolo'd into $gme and I am hoping things will blow up more for them than me. Moral of the story is if more people would sometimes think of others and maybe just let go and help out your fellow man, the world would be a better place. I would buy lunch for a Citidel/RH/Melvin employee any day.   5@91 and holding for that fucking ride in the back of the trailer to the moon (if there's room for me). Peace.
Put a limit sell order on your GME so your broker can't lend them to shortsellers
We're now at $70. Paper hands are reaching for their phones. We need to HOLD THE LINE!! If you put a limit order on your broker to sell all your GME at say, $1000, they will not be allowed to lend those shares to someone else. Make sure to increase this amount as gme goes to $69,000.   This is not financial advice. I don't know anything about stocks and investing. Don't listen to me. I like the stock blablabla  ✊ 👉   👌 👆 ✌️
Still in it baby! Hold!

The name of the game is Diamond hands!
One thing that the media is printing which is obviously true is that the site has definitley got an influx of bots. I know i a bot doesn't really understand this but - fuck you. I've already written off my \~£4000 (Europoor)  the influx of bots definitley has hit the momentum and what shit is happening in the USA with the SEC is also not helping. SO what have i got for my \~£4000? Well a fucking great story in the history of Reddit, a load of boomers crying on tv about how they can only afford their holiday on their yacht for 10 months this year, not 11, and soooo many memes. Its like paying back a penny for every meme ive seen so far.   Some are saying this is the end, others saying its all games and who knows, when the short position comes out on the 9th, it might energise a second movement. Who the fuck cares, Im having fun, i like the stock        Disclaimer: Im Europoor, so the SEC can shove a potato up its ass. Also i think my broker is retarded when it comes to £->$->£, or maybe i am?     Screen shot 17:26 GMT:
Want to invest are these a good idea?
I have put 20$ in GLUmobile 15in FarmVille and 3$ in SIRUIS. Am I adumbass or a millionaire?
Time for some serious discussion here
Got 5k to spare. Down 15k because of GME  Thinking of buying 50x2/12 $26 @ $   Est return \~ 20k.  Smart play or nah
Reminder that we don’t care about stock price
The play on GME since January has been a short squeeze play, buy and hold. At some point the massive amounts of outstanding shares has to come home to roost, and as long as we control a majority of the float we are mooning. The current price is only controlled by paper hands and the hedges trading back and forth.  How am I so confident that the hedges haven’t covered? Well for starters they certainly didn’t cover in the run up to the 400s. The volume after that has been anemic. And with the current botting activity here there is certainly still a lot of money at play.  Conclusion: I just like the stock, do whatever you want with that info.
Loss porn or GTFO
To all the retards posting crap about how they are losing money while changing the world:  You are changing jack shit. Hedge funds are on both sides of the play and sure you might be hurting one anonymous asshole, but you are also enriching 3 others.  More importantly though, post your loss porn, I don't really care about your snowflake grassroots efforts. If you don't have massive gains to brag about, or some interesting DD, then at least post some loss porn or GTFO.
Motivational Speech.
Hello fellow apes of the WSB community. There has been an increase of Debbie-Downers in the past few days regarding GME. LISTEN UP. I KNOW NONE OF YOU CAN READ BUT YOU GOTTA LEARN HOW TO FOR THIS SPEECH.   There have been multiple retards that put their life savings into this stock, taken out loans, and pretty much fucked themselves in the ass because of this stock. I once had $2000 in my account, and now have $950. This is all of my money as well, but I’m a teen. GUESS FUCKING WHAT?   JUST FUCKING HOLD AND BE PATIENT  . Don’t listen to the dumbasses predicting if and when this shit will explode, you will only lose more hope.  Sadly the odds currently aren’t in our favor, with the SEC fucking us over as well as the hedge funds right now. WHO’S TO SAY THAT THIS WILL LAST? WE ARE ALREADY DOWN ENOUGH, THERE’S NO POINT IN BEING AFRAID TO LOSE MORE.   I’m stupid and don’t know much about stocks so I’m just repeating what everyone else is saying in this subreddit:   The hedge funds are eventually gonna have to cover the shares so as long as you don’t be a paper handed bitch and sell, this will eventually play out in our favor.   How long you may ask? NO ONE KNOWS. JUST BE PATIENT. LEARN A NEW HOBBY. START WORKING OUT. DON’T STARE AT THE MARKET ALL DAY, IT WILL DO NOTHING.   Finally, remember what we are fighting for! We are fucking up the hedge funds, saving GameStop, and   hopefully   getting rich!!!! NOTHING IS GUARANTEED, SO IF WE LOSE THIS BATTLE JUST REMEMBER THAT   YOU ARE A FUCKING TROOPER. YOU ARE THE DEFINITION OF DIAMOND HANDS. KEEP YOUR HEAD HIGH. AND YOU NEED TO HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You were all used - Some of you already realize it, others realized it and are already gone. Here is exactly how you were used for anyone that's left
1. You were used by the founder of this sub. He did nothing to help the sub during the GME runup, he hadn't been involved at all for a long time before hand. But he's just sold the rights to his 'life story' to a movie producer for low six figures   .  2. You were used by other hedge funds. Here is one story, but there are plenty that made money off the run as well. They never cared about Wallstreet or funds over extending themselves with a short bet. All they saw was a momentum play, and they played it. You made it easier for them by making market sentiment completely transparent.   .  3. You were used by me too. I didn't play it anywhere close to perfect, but I made a good chunk of money buying/selling calls during the run up. My biggest mistake was underestimating the volume and I hedged my longs by selling calls which really ate up my potential gains. I did get in and out though, and paid off a substantial amount of debt.  4. You will continue to get used by investment funds going forward. There are already news articles up today about "hottest stocks on reddit!" The mainstream media is so easy to manipulate (since they have no interest in fact checking financial news) that big players will continue to use the media to pump and dump securities.  5. You are getting used by people with a political agenda to push their narrative. "WSB is leaving out anyone who isn't a straight white male!" for example  6. You've been used by other stock market subs as entertainment and as a lesson. Go ahead and take a look at /r/stocks or /r/options. They've been making fun of the echo chamber in here for days now.  7. It is at least a possibility that you'll get used in a good way. Perhaps, just maybe....politicians will use this fiasco as a springboard to make real change. Maybe when a hedge fund takes a short position then hires a PR firm and a private investigator to "look into" a company they've shorted, this will need to be public information. Maybe when an "analyst" goes on TV to pump or short a stock they have a stake in it will need to be completely clear that they stand to financially gain from the "advice" they are giving.  There is a chance this could happen. But, what I think will actually happen is rule makers will look at this as "what can we do to make sure this never happens again?" and come to the conclusion that short interest can and will be even less transparent going forward.  The problem is that the Biden administration is very entrenched in wall street's interests, and the SEC can really only issue fines (they won't ban anyone from the stock market over this). And there won't be nearly enough social media support because not enough people on the left are willing to say anything negative about Biden or Democrats. People on the right will of course complain about how the Biden team and Democrats will mess up their "investigation", but they won't have any credibility, and they have practically no serious presence on social media.
I’m interested in learning more about the Robinhood debacle
It seems when GME became the subject of literally every single news networks 7pm headline story, real good analysis of the situation got drowned out.  I’d love to read about the nitty-gritty of Robinhood’s liquidity problems and why they had to lock customers out, as well as the mechanics behind selling order flow and the stock clearing house mechanism that goes on behind the scenes.  I know I saw some amazing research pieces out there before, but it’s borderline IMPOSSIBLE to find them now that Google is crowded with freakin Fox Business news stories that just say “GME go up” over and over...  Anyone got some sweet, sweet, deep, yummy informational shit they could share?  Thanks.
To everyone who writes encouraging posts:
Thank you.  We are all in this together   . Every-time my paper handed side starts taking over, my retard ass comes here and reads all the posts and comments (wait i dont know how to read) and those    come back baby.  KEEP HOLDING         LETS GOO BOYS (AND BADASS GIRLS)
loss porn for short HF
Can someone create a chart that shows how much the short hedge funders are losing? I need some good loss porn
To answer why GME is going down so much
The boat is simply coming back for all the rookie autists who missed the   to the   the first time.   BUY THE DIP AND HOLD    Next time it jumps, we’ll send you pictures of the view from the mountain top.
Down but but buying more!!!
I'm down like $30k but I just bought 10 more shares on this dip!! Will buy even more tomorrow when I get paid! This is the hardest part right now, the waiting. But if we just ignore the price movements, and go sip on a coffee and read a book, the price will     before even know it. Just    and and the rest will take care of itself. Not an advisor, I just like the stock a lot.
I need advice
I don’t have a lot of money, and that’s fine. No complaints. But I bought shares of AMC before Robinhood revealed itself to be absolute filth in terms of their loyalties. Now I have a dilemma. I want to hold the 10 shares I could afford (and afford to lose) because I’m not planning on selling and letting the HF win. But I also don’t want to support this shitty app. What would you do in this situation?
Make it make sense
Fellow apes, retards, autists, and newbies;  I don't understand how the price of GME will rise after the "short ladder attacks". I am currently holding my GME stocks bought in @ $234. I am watching the price go down every day, and I am keeping my   , but I keep seeing posts about how the price will shoot up to $1000+.  How in the high holy fuck is this possible? If we fellow apes hold, and the HFs who shorted need to buy our shares eventually to cover, how will they buy our shares ifwe don't sell? Do we just buy the dip to raise the price?
Selling Now Is A GUARANTEED Loss
Even Having The Slimmest Chance Of Coming Out On Top, Is Better Than NONE AT ALL!
Tax Loss Harvesting, or How To Get Your Own GME Bailout
This is not tax or financial advice.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.    How do you do, fellow retards?  Why so glum?  Did you buy GME at $200+ and watch it immediately crater to $60?  Are you spending sleepless nights and overcaffeinated days wondering if some miracle will happen so you can exit the sinking ship without realizing losses?    Well, it won't.        But there's some   good news   for you crayon eating apes, that you may not be aware of if this is your first foray into gambling on stocks:        You can write off capital losses on your taxes, up to $3000 per year.        That's right, if you watched the past 20 years of birthday money evaporate recently, you can go cry to Uncle Sam and he'll take pity on your poor autistic souls.  You could potentially even end up   getting money back   in the form of a tax refund.      Feels a little bit better now, doesn't it?  Takes a bit of the sting out of it, yeah?   You can unburden yourself of this trainwreck right now and get back to living a blissfully WSB-free life.  Or, you can wait to see if something incredible happens, driving the stock price up and making everyone zillionaires, and sell it at the end of the year if(when) that doesn't happen.  Either way, you don't have to eat a permanent shit sandwich just because you impulsively hopped on a bandwagon without any idea of what you were doing and missed the boat.  Just... try to learn something from the experience.      Consult a professional.  I am not a tax or finance professional, and this is not tax or financial advice.
Do you guys sell for profit at a certain percentage point, or is there a strategy to minimize losses on stocks/stonks?
Just wondering, I’ve been on and off investing in NIO, and I was just wondering if it’s smarter to take the 25% gain, or wait until the EV market has another rise?   Similar question to other stocks, do you guys sell based off percentages, or where you think the stock is going to go?  Thanks I’m advance
Diamond Hands Forever
Literally, you'll have to hold forever.   This sub keeps moving the goal posts.   It's time to face reality.
Price predictions for GME next week
Disclaimer: I bought GME at $40 and sold most at $250. I am currently only holding 50 shares @$65.  Now for my predictions. GME will hit $80 tomorrow easy. We will see $90 on Monday and $120 by Friday next week due to an Elon tweet.
No matter WHAT, get off Robinhood!
I know the reason Robinhood blocked the trades but they are still financially supported by the shorts. They can do this to you at ANY time, on ANY trade that gets hot.  Drop them like your wife drops you for her boyfriend. Transfer to Fidelity, TD Ameritrade or some other stable brokerage that won't use your data to screw you over.  It is EASY to do. It may take some time to transfer but time is on our side. GET OFF ROBINHOOD. They will not support you when the time comes. They do not like   nor   .  If Robinhood does this again at a time of great trading, it won't be their fault. It will be yours because you knew who they are and what they do.
The big hold?
My holding is down over 70% (-500) and while I'm happy to ride it out, how much more of a percentage fuck do some of y'all expect people to take before they can no longer stomach any of the theories that are being thrown about as to when the stock will rise?  There are real retards out there and I'm one of them!
Sell AMC to buy GME
We need to stick with one target to win. And we know GME is the god to worship
The HedgeFunds think they have us by the balls, but they don't realize our balls are made of diamond
Obligatory              I noticed that big loss porn doesn't get a lot of attention anymore because people are scared, but losing money is one of the fundamentals of this sub. So to motivate eachother I want this entire commentsection to be full of disgusting losses.   Goodluck retards!
LETTER TO THE SEC FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART
A message to the SEC from the bottom of my heart  The last week I’ve seen history being made, but not in a positive way, the retail investor, the small guy, the bottom of the society was winning a battle against the Wall St billionaires also known as the rats that made the economy crumble on 08, then we saw THE BIGGEST MARKET MANIPULATION EVER ONG, wtf were those buying restrictions? That was blatant market manipulation. How tf did y’all got it backwards and now are investigating this subreddit?  You are a fucking joke stupid ass motherfuckers, hope you all get fucked, fucking useless organization, your name should be “Wall St Dicksuckers” fuck you and your investigations, you won’t get shit, you WONT DO SHIT SO FUCK YOU  BUY GME, BUY AMC FELLAS  THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE BECAUSE I SIMPLY DONT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK, SEC LICK MY FUCKING DIAMOND HAIRY BALLS
New Retard here, need help
Hey guys, Im from Europe, I wanna buy GME & AMC,  you recommend a tradding platform?
Have any of you had success in explaining this to your family?
I'm a father of 5.Husband, Son, and Brother.  But for the life of my it seems increasingly difficult to justify this to my S/O, parents,   kids are looking at me like I'm insane as I Diamond Clutch and Beat my idiot chest.Brothers, we're all family here... But how do I get my other family to see that?  Sincerely, Robashabakuru, The BigDumb Ape Daddy       NOT SELLING TILL IM DEAD JUST WANT THEM TO KNOW WHY
OH NO! MY FAVORITE THING AT THE STORE IS ON SALE!
Said no one ever.   It’s a dip made by shit stick Melvin and Citadel. Why can no one use margin on GME or AMC? Why are there still limits on the amount you can buy on some platforms still. Buy the dip, or wait for it to dip lower, who knows how long they’ll pump it down. But those fuckers have to buy those shares back eventually and my brain is so smooth I forgot how to sell. Don’t buy if you’re broke and want quick gains. But if you like the stock like me. Very good stock, very solid stock not being manipulated by any multi billion dollar hedge funds it’s actually being masterminded by some retards on Reddit that trade at most a few thousand shares and have there wife’s boyfriend fund there shenanigans. Looking at you SEC intern who can’t understand how our boy Harambe is guiding us to the promise land or how taking our wife’s ring her boyfriend gave her and holding it for weeks will make us money.   Not financial advice I’m just retarded and like the stock.
I am retarded and I love it
Was about to check up how my GME thing is going, and when I saw red color again, I just sold my other stock and bought more GME. Should I be worried about my mental health?    Edit: It is now even lower, and I was about to buy more, but I realised that I am now just a broke student   not an investment advice
There’s no point...
There’s no point in selling tbh if I’ve already lost so much money I may as well ride it to either $0 or the moon. I’ll probably end up buying even more if it gets even lower to lower my average buy in cost. Fuck the hedge funds and paper hands im  🤲 to the moon or hell
The open interest on calls is too high and could be the cause of these drops.
The open interest on calls for our BANG gang stocks are ridiculously high. The whole reason for this manipulation could be related to this. Hedge funds are selling you naked calls, suppressing the price so they can recover funds while covering shorts. My theory is they're using our expired call profits to cover all their short interest. Thoughts?
Why buying the dip is not stupid memetalk but the best advice you can follow now (and that helps our cause) if you bought +150USD
Listen up fellow shitslinging crayonmunchers :   A lot of us are hurting right now. They're hurting real bad. It hurts in the meowmeow.   But we must not get papery hands and drop the ball. All you have to do is hold. Just don't do anything, and if you want to do something else than press that sell button with your hands, use them to rub one out.  BUT  If you absolutely want to do something because you're hurting real real bad because you bought shares when they were at +150USD?   BUY. SOME. MORE  No, it's not stupid hyped up nonsense memetalk.   Say you bought 10 shares at 250. That means your Average Share Price is exactly that 250 and your TOTAL SHARE PRICE is 2500USD.  But if you buy ANOTHER 10 shares now at 50 that DOUBLES your total amount of shares to 20 and brings the total Purchase Price of your shares to 3000USD. You have DOUBLE the shares (=double the payout) for only 1/6th of your TOTAL SHARE PRICE. You are dividing hedging your risk more.  Sure, putting in more money seems absurd now, but for a very limited amount of extra cash you can easily DOUBLE, TRIPLE, MOONTUPLE your gains.  Also remember, gainsday might be a long time away, just hold on.  Remember : if you bought 3TC in 2017 and held it until now, you can hold GME till 2023.  This is not financial advice, this is relative thinking.
If GME hits 180 or if PLTR hits 45 next week I will drop out of high school or donate all of my earnings
Edit 2: getting a lot of comments saying stay and stuff, what should I do about my portfolio? Where should I donate it?? I’ve built it to $450k roughly, check my portfolio. GME   PLTR     What’s good fellow autists?  I’m a junior in high school and all school does is push me back, from boring subjects that I don’t have to learn, to teachers that don’t like me.  So why not drop out?? I’ll start working on my GED. YOLO  My portfolio/proof: (and they're verified)     Trading is definitely my passion, and I think I can trade and work a part-time job. I made 100% returns and YOLO’d my entire portfolio into meme spots.  What do you guys think?  If dropping out gets a negative reaction should I just donate all of my earnings? It'll be a lot, as seen in my portfolio. That'll be almost $450k donated.
PSA: Our success depends on US
Let’s get one thing straight: As long as retail investors hold the stock, we control the price. If we sell, we give up that control.   From what I’ve seen, only a fraction of the shorts have been covered, and if they all were, why is all the media trying to convince us that they are? Would the hedge funds care if we thought they were covered if they actually WERE covered? Of course not.   Additionally, think about this: if you sold your $15 share in order to buy it at $10, would you want to cover it now at $70? Now multiply that by hundreds—likely thousands—of stocks. They’re still at risk of losing big, and we still hold a ton of shares that we’re not selling for $70, so they cannot cover themselves.   DO NOT LET THE MANIPULATION GET TO YOU. USE YOUR SMOOTH, GORILLA BRAIN. DFV bought into Gamestop because he liked the stock and had reason to see the value. I still see that value, I still like this stock. I just hold strong, ignore the pessimism and look at the facts: they have not covered, we hold the control. Let’s keep it that way.   Btw this isn’t financial advice, I’m just an idiot who wrote this for myself and have nowhere else to put it. I really just like this stock.
When should I sell GME?
Hi. I bought the stock not long ago and I have been holding. But at some point I do need to sell the stock, so I'm wondering when everyone thinks would be a good time. Thanks!
Robinhood bought stocks on a restricted account without my knowledge
About a week ago, I sold all of my positions on robinhood to transfer to webull.  I woke up this morning to notifications that I had bought about $500 (50% of my portfolio) of GameStop, AMC, and BB without placing the order.  Now, I have no option to sell these stocks because they are no longer in my account.  What should I do in this kind of situation?  I can’t find any instances of this happening to anyone else online.   TLDR robinhood bought stocks on my restricted account and they disappeared so I am $500 in the hole with no option to sell the stocks they bought on my account.
Politico draws a simile between WSB and Occupy Wall Street
" On Sunday, following a week when Reddit users drove up the prices of a select few stocks and upended Wall Street’s every expectation of how the stock market should work, approximately 50 demonstrators gathered in Zuccotti Park in Manhattan’s financial district. They were there to protest limits imposed on “the little guy” — by which they meant retail stock traders who had found a way to make money by banding together on the Robinhood trading app to move the markets. After saying their piece, they took some selfies and left. "
Hot new stock $GME
Great company that you may have heard of before, Gamestop is DIPPING right now. Buy now while good deal   Thoughts?  EDIT: Suck my weewee gay bears
Los Manos de Diamantes
Consider the wealth consolidation since covid, 12 figure suits getting 1 trillion $$ richer.  Now consider the depravity of the streets and how disgusting powerful people act so selfishly in setting the social systems to have someone's back who can't offer it for themselves. Who is going to fix these problems? The conglomerates who have siphoned more wealth in a year than human history has ever seen? Don't think so Harambe.  We are. The little man. The beating hearts of Chads and Staceys worldwide. And nothing will stop us.  I can't read. My favorite colored crayon is blue-green. I have to liquidate tendies often to buy the 64 pack because it doesn't come in the standard 16 pack. Red never appealed to me. I don't like it on a chart. Why would i want it in my mouth?   I live in my mother's basement. I have 7 capped World of Warcraft characters. I'm a diamond tier rocket league player. My Steam inventory consists of 4,269 of the best games most have never dreamed to hear of. I beat my chest when i arrive in the jungle because I am that alpha and my presence must be known. My hands have been eroded many times over by the most elegant ancient sands. At the end of the day, i am not financially literate and possess zero wherewithal in offering knowledge i don't have.  But i know what I'm going to do.
I could’ve made around $50k with GME last week but I didn’t sell out.
Holding because I like the stocks! I believed in the real squeeze! And went in with money I was willing to lose. I also know I wouldn’t have made that much profit if it wasn’t for the DD y’all post and hilarious memes.  My learning lesson is to pay myself (yes sell a little) at a reasonable peak but got caught in the momentum and wanted to stick it to WallSt (especially after what RH did) and not let fellow astronauts behind like a true   When RH had trade restrictions last Thu I still bought 10 more shares thru my Vanguard acct at some of the highs (averaging up) YOLO. GME were the first shares I’ve bought from any company directly and I def set myself up for a Tesla or food s  situation. This experience has made me more wayyyy more aware about my financials, so THANK YOU, WSB. It’s also been hella stressful to see it all unfold not gonna lie. Still holding strong with you soldiers   🏼 Not financial advice just a damn   eating
My (totally uneducated) theory on what might be going on right now with GME
We know that it’s costing the HFs millions if not billions of dollars right now with their short positions, and these ladder attacks that are dropping the price are also costly.  I think what they might be trying to do is spend a lot of money right now to make the price go lower. With the price this low, they spam this sub saying sell sell sell and the true Diamond Handers who don’t care if this really goes to 0 keep reminding people to hold.  But this is part of their plan. Because now these people who are on the edge of selling are going to be itching to get their money back if at all possible.  With that being said, I think the HFs might be looking to create a controlled chaos mini squeeze soon. Jack the price back up to say $300/$350 so that all these people who have lost their life savings on this are almost back to/are back to average.  A lot of these people will sell, allowing the HFs to cover a large number of their shorts. This will then again drop the price, but we will have a lot less people holding.  What do you guys think? I’ve never even taken an economics class so what the fuck do I know. This isn’t financial advice, this is the musings of an uneducated diamond handed kid   🏻
GME was a bubble
I had a feeling it was. I still bought at $300 cause fuggit yolo. The GME chart does not match the VW chart so lets stop pretending like it does go look up literally any bubble and look at that chart and it looks like GME. That being said diamond   hands I’m not selling this is a dive not a dip but idc it still looks like a sale to me so I’m buying.
I just wanna say thank you yall. I've lost a lot, not as much as some but im not taking this ride for granted
This ship skyrocketed from peoole having fomo, and now it's suffering from that same fomo as well. Unless we buy every billboard idk if we're gonna get that momentum back. But we didn't start this for that surge of people. We started it to stand next to DFV and make some cash down the road  Ya the party was fun but now it's just us and the 2 close friends who stay behind to help clean up. It's just the real diamond hands left, which is fine cause thats how it started.   I'll admit I got swept up in the frenzy thinking this could rocket sooner than expected, and ya im a little miffed it hasn't yet but we knew this could happen from the jump. So regardless of what I'm feeling I wanna say this last week so much fun. The news and everyone talking about it but regardless of what happened I got to actually live it with you guys. I mean their making a movie outa this for christ sake. So from the diamond hands to the toilet paper hands I wanna say thanks for the ride so far. It gave my monotonous and boring life a little more excitement than usual. And that's to me is at least worth the amount I put into this
All you paperhanded bitches..
I don't understand why there are people who have sold but stick around on this sub and the discord to laugh at the people who are still holding their shares?   I saw a guy on the discord that bought at $300 and sold three days later? What a paper handed bitch, I don't give a shit about the money, it's the cause that gets my nuts tingling and if you sold, fine and well done to you but don't try rub it in to peoples faces when you lost money.  It isn't a loss until you sell.
So Melvin stated that they exited their short position on 1/27 when GME was ~$350 and then 8 days later the price falls to ~$70?
8 days? billions of dollars of losses could have been prevented for Melvin?   every day for 8 days on average the stock fell 10% a day from $350 to $70?   How stupid does it sound that a professional hedge fund would close a short position they have been holding for months, if not years, at the peak - when just 8 days later the price fell 80%?  lol.... ok. Now that is some fucking crazy risk control and mitigation techniques.   I am still holding.
We've reached a BIG weekly support area for GME
This $58-64 area is the previous all time high and is a big support if it can hold expect a solid bounce. GME holding the line here has potential to be a big win for bulls.
I‘m just here to have a good laugh
Sitting here with a bucket of pop corn laughing at all you delusional morons who seriously thought the stock price would go higher than $500. I’ve got news for you - it won’t. I‘m a short-seller and made about $80k from this ridiculous situation. Have a nice day/evening.
Guys, I'm so sorry.. it was a huge damage to my mental health, I hope you understand
So I bought in 550 shares at the peak of the revolution @ 400  Since then my portfolio has been dropping and dropping and it was really taking a toll on me and I couldn't take it anymore   I seen the price drop so much and I flinched.  I got in for 550 more shares. Ain't nothing more sweet than the dip. February 9th until their reign is over, let us get what is ours.  If I'm holding you are holding too, you retard.. For peace of mind I'll let you hold my balls while your wife pleases me tonight
Why are you tards selling your stonks?
If you can't afford to lose it all, then don't hop on the rocket.   Simple as that.  🦾
Okay which of you retards did this
I don’t understand
Why the FUCK is the price dropping. WHICH ONE OF YOU ARE SELLING, I SMELL BITCH IN HERE. wanna know what happens when the price goes down? YOU LOSE FUCKING MONEY. So when the price goes down and you already lost money. FUCK IT! double down.   We Didn’t Come Here For Scraps!                    🤲                              GME70 @

Gme! Updates!
Some updates on GME  Disclaimer: I am not a professional and this is not investment advice. I am long GME (216 shares cuz poor) and   ing.  This post is for those of you who are new and asking about why people are still holding in this stock. It represents my personal opinion, often backed up by facts, but also including theorizing. This is all in addition to the original DD+updates, which can be viewed here:              # 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.  Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)   EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.  That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.  I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough   are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).  Forget the moon....          to some kind of permanent orbit.  # 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises  On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price   SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share  . Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one "Kjetill Stjerne" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would "hold the line" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like "hunt=shortsells". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.  After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.  What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some   it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:  # 3) Broker Restrictions    IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS     :    This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: "We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having   TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES  . He also talked about how he "saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro "accidentally" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.  # 4) Media Manipulation  It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the "short squeeze" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how "reddit" or the "reddit army" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported   it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.  Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that "the short squeeze has happened."  The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the "new" articles after doing a Google search of "GME." You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly "new" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the "frenzy", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)  # 5) Bot accounts  There's been a massive influx in this sub of   that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.     These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.  If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other "next targets of Reddit", Qanon comparisons, etc);  if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);  if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (  the next day  ) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)  proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.  if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;  if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;  if there wasn't constant reporting about "shorts have definitely already covered" for weeks;  if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);  Edit: if the GME and AMC graphs hadn't been paralleling each other for a week;    if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options  ;  if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still   insanely   high imo);    and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;      Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.    Don't ever buy stock/options with money you can't afford to lose.
ok, unpopular opinion here. we lost the battle but won the war
personally i feel this needs to be said. we won. we shook and changed the system. not every war is without casualties. sadly, we need to accept defeat. if we dont, then were just making thousands of people who are not ready for this battle to step into the fight and die financially. i think its disingenuous to hype up the battle without knowing who your reaching out to. yes, this sub if full of retards, and Retards. new members don't know the difference.   we won the war. wallstreet wont be able to pull this shit again and they know it. they're scared of what this community is capable of and we brought attention to the world about the corruption and how deep it goes. wasn't that the plan? isn't that alone a victory?   i bought in with house money and i sold while still keeping house money. everyone needs to know their outs. im 100 behind the movement but financially i cannot. i really do wish to see you all blast off, i do. good luck
Why is $NOK still shitting itself?
New investor here, but I started following them since I heard about the moon mission. They just released an earnings report that was better than expected too, but stonk still go down. Should a retard invest?
A genuine question to the smart people in this sub
My mind is confused about one topic and I think most of the people here are aswell.  -Now lets think about how heavily shorted GME was before the things that happened last week.  1) We know GME was shorted like 140% (when it was 10-20$)  2) Right now some say that the percentage of the shorts increased or decreased and we don’t seem to have any legit data about this.  3) Lots of people say that the shorts have covered their original shorts which were around 5 to 10 dollars and instead have their shorts based on 300 to 400 dollars.  So my question is about the third argument. How can so many people be sure that shorts that were originally underwater were covered? It makes no sense as the HFs who owned these shorts had to buy most of stocks to cover and that alone would have caused the short squeeze to go astronomical. But that didn’t happen instead it went up just a bit.   My guess and it is just a thought and not a financial advice. Why wouldn’t most of HFs be still under water? I think right now what is going on is the HFs are trying to gobble up some stocks from a price point that is as low as possible to cover their original shorts so they dont lose that much money.  I just like the stock and I want you smooth-brains to help me to find an answer about this.   G M E     to        the         M O O O O N
Seeing too many people asking "Should we still hold the line?" - the answer is..
YES. Yes we definitely should, you damn dirty    If you held after the previous run, and are still in the GME, then selling now would be absolutely pointless. You'd be taking a loss. And if more people start thinking like this, then we all lose.  The fact is that we expected all of this to happen. It would almost be sus if HF and MSM let us just shove our giant $COCK into the market and do what we wanted.  We knew it'd be a hard road after the last rush. If you leave now, then the dream slowly dies for each of us who do the same. If we stick together, and HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. Then not only do we have a chance, but we'll hit the fucking moon and then some  🌕  Don't be a scared 🐒, be a strong    This is not financial advice, ya beautiful bastards!
Some itty bitty loss porn for you degenerates to 🍆✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿💦💦 to 😎😎😎
I can't wait for his testimony.
Bought GME at 350, and bought more on sale today. Averaging down slowly and never going to sell.     they think a few scary days can make me sell? Yea right. They’d have to keep this up for years to change my mind.
Am I stonking right?
At this point, selling is just stupid
I bought gme at 200 and I'm holding. That's it. Period.
Did they cover their shorts or not?
The only way I’m holding the bag is if they had already cover their shorts a week ago.
All the people who bought at $300 and are still holding
I'm convinced all of the "Hold until tomorrow!" or "Just wait for tomorrow" or "Just wait until however many days/some specific date" are all hedge fund manipulation tactics. There is no date. They are betting on the fact that they can hold out longer than us. This could take weeks, months, or more.
It costs them money to keep their positions for longer and longer, and I'm ready to drain them for as long as it takes. It doesn't cost me anything to hold. If you are convinced that something is happening "tomorrow" or even "next week" and then it doesn't happen, you lose heart and you show us all your paper hands.
The case for Ericsson ($ERIC), A DD for Retards by a Retard.
Listen up retards, I’m not the best at explaining so please bare with me.   All this noise about Nokia when Ericcson is outperforming them makes 0 sense. Ericcson is cucking Nokia so hard that positive news about Ericcson raised buy ratings on Nokia.     Ericcson has had some strong performance year over year due to 5G contracts and has actually somehow came out of last week better than it went in (currently $  at my time of writing this).     It even decided against a bond offering to raise money! They know they don’t need it!     While Nokia has even admitted it expects revenue to drop over the next year.     Full disclosure, I own calls (for the 19th of both months) and stonks. Despite strength in the price action, it seems to have a ton of suits rooting against it. Looking on Marketbeat we can see a massive volume of short interest shares. UP 22% on a biweekly period on the closing months of last year alone!     On my platform if I check options pricing, it seems a lot of the pressure is pushing from the top down into the $11 area, which I personally don’t understand given the success and amount of contracts they have been signing in the past week alone.        They have lots of work coming down the pipeline. These guys are on SALE right now at $13 especially as 5G and beyond   up. Please let a fellow retard know what you think. Perhaps someone here a lot smarter than I am can explain to me why I’m wrong or expand on why I'm right. These guys (imho) will provide great medium to long term gains, and will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.   DISCLAIMER 1: I AM RETARDED, DO YOUR OWN DD.   DISCLAIMER 2: IF YOU’RE HOLDING AMC or GME, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE.
Atleast portnoy was transparent - why not riot against the pumpers?
Yates and stan have been pumping alongside in the fight, until they went silent.  Yates is notorious for this & Stan a piece of garbage in general - but why are we calling out portnoy and not the rest?  Also hold your shit        - fuck you SEC intern
Down over 85% on GME - while still holding, this here was made
Anyone see what Elon posted on Twitter? To the moon??
All it needs is attention like we've been giving AMC and GME. Let's get it. To the moon, baby.
The short squeeze is right in front of us
Those with losses due to RH trading restrictions
Why not just do a charge back of your deposit?
idc I’m holding I really like the fucking stock.
Reminder that the Democrats are going to let Wall Street keep being criminals while punishing us. Remember that when you next vote.
What will be the outcome of this battle?
First of all, obligatory: 27 $GME @243  But I don’t mean what will be the price and will we win or lose. Throughout this battle between the average joes and the big money, the manipulative techniques used by the big money is used again, like they always have been to fuck over America and the world (I’m Canadian but I’m with y’all). Except this time it’s different. This time we got the attention of the world. We caused such a ripple that the government can’t just turn a blind eye...  But what will happen after this? Will there be a reform of the financial market? Or will this just be a thing that happened along with others and forgotten by all years in the future?  I hear a lot of people say:” I came to make money, stayed for the cause”. Me too. But there’s nothing we can do.  Apes, weigh in on this with your opinion.
Handing it to the HedgeFunds
I know Morale seems to be a bit down here lately, but let me say this: This was/is all about handing it to the hedgies. On the 9th of February, we'll know how many shorts have been covered by the HF's. There are three options here:   A) (Very unlikely) -> They covered their shorts and we lost.   B) (Likely) -> They have covered some shorts, but not even close to all of them   C) (Likely) -> They covered some shorts, and shorted again at peak.     So what does this mean? Well, if A is true, then this is over. But, do you truly believe that? I don't. Now, if B is correct, then holding is the way to go. But what about C? If C is true, they'd be making back their money by now. But guess what? With Limits lifted, and everything cooling down, we can skyrocket the price AGAIN. This time, above 400$, and make the hedgies bleed again. We just need to unite, and we can once again strike a devastating blow to the hedgies. LET'S HOLD AND WAIT. IF THEY SHORTED MORE, LET'S PUSH THE PRICE UP!
WTF?
AMC and GME Thoughts
You wanna know my thoughts? THAT WE EITHER BUY THE DIP OR HOLD OUR SHARES, NO SELLING. We are in the midst of some Grade A shit, but you know what apes do? THROW SHIT! We need to remain strong and throw this shit back in the hedgies face once their tactics fail!  I am pretty retarded and not soliciting financial advice. GORILLA GRIP DIAMOND HANDS BABY
I am HOLDING  🤟 🤟 are YOU?
1st post ever, just HOLD
Hello fellow retards, I know some of you are disappointed at the price of the stock right now, BUT STAY STRONG AND HOLD.   I bought when it was at 300 and won't let those bastards have the last laugh, consider this as another flash sale.  And I just like stock  🏿‍♂️
Averaging down and HOLDING THE LINE
Bought the dip bitches.     Wallstreet can't unshine the spotlight we recieved in previous weeks. Is it realistic to expect a stock that was, recently THE MOST TRADED STOCK GLOBALLY, to remain undervalued?  Aw hell no. And lets not forget yesterdays news; the re  and redirection of the core business is underway, and a profitable quarter is incoming;     This is just the beginning. Not financial advice but fuck I like the stock.
Best. Sale. Ever.
BUY AND HOLD!   THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, MY VOCABULARY IS VERY LIMITED AND I CAN'T READ!
CRSR is slowly creeping up - not financial advice!
Thanks 4 discount paper hands
While you sell to scrape together change to pay for your wife and her boyfriend to go to dinner tonight, I’m buying up your discounted shares and throwing them in my suitcase to come with me to the moon
Looks like a pleasant day, can't wait for tomorrow!
I BELIEVE IN YOU
Hi everyone, first of all I don't know sht about the stock market. I'm a true retard, however i've been lurking this subreddit for years. I learnt a lot of things from that, 1. we are retarded autists, 2. Stonks only go up 3. this community does not give up. To all the newbies or long time wsb members i've got something to say.  Last week when i bought GME at 330, i YOLO'd 6k into it. Even though i'm now down   i don't paperhand or stop losing confidence in this community. I have seen how these guys don't care about how much they lose, they keep going and next thing you see when you open Reddit is half a mil gains. To everyone holding the line, sooner or later you will be the one posting your half a mil gains. Remember that and to hell with those hedgies
WTF is wrong with you?
All day I read posts about you whining and being depressed and „let’s be real“ and „I am done“. I have been a long time lurker in Reddit/WSB (without acc) and I finally jumped on the GMEAMC train with spare money. Is this even the right sub?? If you throw your money in this casino, expect to lose it. If you can’t afford to lose it, you are stupid. Just stop bitching around. I hold and wait with my few shares for the squeeze. English is not my first language.   GME: 14 @ $231 AMC: 22 @ $10
Still Holding    (But starting to have   help)
I need some assurance here. I bought GME @ $300 and it pains me to see the losses right now. I understand no losses occur until you sell, so I'm holding strong, but seeing the price action dip to below $80, then recover to $120, to now sitting in the $60 range is becoming extremely disheartening and making me question if this whole thing is over.   Does anyone have evidence or information to help me feel better about holding at these levels? I'm not really expecting to make money on this trade anymore, but rather than sell, I figured I'd let you autist be my hypemen.
DIAMOND HANDS, BABY
HOLDING 2 SHARES OF GME AND 66 SHARES OF AMC AND I AM NOT MOVING. FUCK THE HEDGIES AND THEIR BULLSHIT LADDER STRATEGIES. I AM SICK WITH THE POINTLESS NEGATIVITY IN THE SUB. WHO ELSE HERE IS HOLDING?  Edit: For Those asking for proof; my shit sum of stocks is nothing to be proud of compared to the rest of you tards and tardettes on here, but I am still pushing! HOLD TO THE MOON.
People still believe! APE STRONG TOGETHER!
The Truth
Many folks here have become suspicious of the HOLD battle cry, like it’s a fad or something great in theory but poor in practice...leaving us suckered.  ITS NOT. We (legally) encourage market confidence and value through making the stand, our resolve wins the day, all we have to do is use logic and patience. HOLD  Ride the storm, HOLD. You’ll look back on this opportunity to win (in so many ways), and wish you did more. We’ve got this.  Not giving financial advice, I just like the stock.
Loss check
My roommate has tapped out. I will still hold.
I'm in college. I don't have a lot of money to screw around with. However, last March, my roommate (who spends a lot of time on here) got me started on RH. He was making a lot of money on cruise line puts, and I wanted in on the action.  I started with $200 and threw any single dollar bills I got from cash transactions into a savings account, transferred it to RH, and began investing. Before the $GME craze, I had put about $1200 in RH and made about 60% profits. After some coercion from my roommate (and you absolute apes), I bought in. We went up.   Now we're on the way down.  40% of my portfolio is 10 shares of $GME. I have lost a lot this week.  My roommate has tapped out, selling his for a loss, and leaving me unstable in my decision to hold.  I believe in us. We will make $GME soar again. I'm not selling until it hits $1,    Buy the dip. Hold the line. See you lads on the other side.
Friendly reminder: GME is a Brick and Mortar RETAIL GAME STORE
Guys for real everyone needs to take a breath and take a step back. I'm totally on board with stupid plays every now and again on this sub, but this bandwagon $GME to 1000 stuff is getting ridiculous.   In NO WAY is even the current valuation of $66 per share even REMOTELY close to the company's value, and you have to understand all of this hype is based on short positions and market influence, not company merits.   For those of you new to this, understand that hiring some guy from AWS does not immediately make the company viable.   HOLD GME if you like, but stop assuming the actual company is valued correctly in the market. Investing in GME is like playing at a roulette table and putting it all on red, it's a massive gamble.
Love you diamond handed retards!
I am a poor romanian college guy who have put 1200 usd in gme at 340 whenever i get annoyed by the price i just think of you crayon eating autists, and that brings a smile to my face!   I dont even know what am i doing but i got dem diamond hands    hope we make some money together you fucking retards.
Tomorrow is my birthday...
All I want is a trip to the moon.       for the SLV but we don't trust no dirty apes.
Listen to yourself
Greed, lack of discipline and emotional constraint spelled disaster for many here. Nobody could’ve predicted what happened with the whole broker thing that killed the momentum but a lot of people ignored all the clear signs that powerful forces were at play to recover their screw ups, we left a sting at them but we kept poking the wound and eventually we got careless. Please don’t listen to anyone that tells you to sell, buy or hold. Whatever the outcome may be you will be have to access your own personal situation and make a well thought out decision, will you double down and keep buying the drops, sell and accept your losses or hold to wait for a surge again. Whatever it be please make the decision yourself and be happy with it, it will be better to accept the outcome than to let the feeling of utter disappointment and regret to have let others influence you. Please take care of your mental being. I say all of this because we all truly deep inside many of us dropped a lot of our money in it because we got hyped about the huge winnings and how people were so right about it going up, we forgot about the risks as well. So with that said trust yourself only.

with the price tanking this week, a lot of posts are now claiming that i’ve become the dreaded “bagholder”   Does this mean we’ve lost? Im still holding shares and many AMC calls (expiring January next year).   I guess my question is will the price go back up or have the few   🤚ers left been royally screwed?   Seeking honest input and rly hoping this post doesn’t just go unnoticed.   NOTE: I understand that whoever comments is not a financial advisor nor am I seeking legit financial advice. Just the honest opinion from the community.
My country doesn't let me buy GME but that didn't stop me!
Basically subj  You can't blow your lunch money on random bullshit here, you need to be accredited.  Though, a friend hooked me up through his Ameritarde or something.  Got 20 shares @ 100 yesterday, and then 20 more at 91, and getting some more today once he's not busy at work, there's still some gunpowder left specifically for that.  He's holding his shares too  Ain't no shortage of retards on the internet  not financial advise I eat glue for a living  seriously though, this money could feed me for a year
Ya ready?
HOLD $GME! I JUST HAD MY BANANA
WSB Discord is 'full'?
Tried joining the Discord but I got an error message saying "the server is currently full". Is this something that can actually happen, or is Discord trying to prevent people from joining?
Call an Ambulance, But not for us Apes...
Good Afternoon My Ameritard Brothers. I'm letting you know that us Britards are in with the Eurotards on this one. We will try and secure the per-market for you all to then join the fight.  Its been a bloody one, And safe to say its been a shit fight. but to all you diamond hand double D chads    who are putting your nutsacks on the desk and holding that god damn stock, I love you.   Its not about the money.  Its about the fucking stock.  And I like this god damn fucking stock.   HOLD.  IF US APES ALL STICK TO OUR GUNS AND HOLD THE GOD DAMN LINE, WE CAN ENJOY SOME BEAUTIFUL LOSS PORN, BUT IT WONT BE OUR LOSSES WE WILL BE CRACKING ONE OUT TO.   DIAMOND HANDS, IF NOT TO THE MOON, TO VALHALLA!!!
Friendly Reminder: You are doing an excellent job, take some time for yourself and relax
I'ts hard to tell the sentiment of the subreddit at this point, some people continue motivated, others are scared.  No matter what you are feeling right now, just remember you are doing an excellent job.   Some days are gonna be rougher then others, everyone knew it was gonna be hard. No war is won in days, especially against a tough enemy. And even the best of troops need rest, so guys, take your time, stop coming to this subreddit every minute. Even with less posts about it trust your comrades.   Diamond hands will be diamond hands, even if the subreddit got deleted I know I could trust the people here to hold.     So, like I said, take your time guys, trust the process, and trust the people in here. It might take days, weeks, or months, but together we are strong, and I couldn't be more proud to belong to such a united community.  Take care fellow monkeys!     My positions: 6 GME shares at 305 dollars  Edit 1: This is no financial advice, I just hated seeing some negative comments and some negative sentiment on this subreddit. The only purpose of this post was to make everyone know that they should feel proud for the effort they are making because it is not said enough, this is a tough situation and everyone should value themselves
Don't panic
No financial advice, personal opinion:  Are you in? HOLD OR LOSE.  Want in? BUY NOW & HOLD.  Not interested? Go away.  There is no need to panic. If you are holding, you are not losing. If you're buying now, you're INVESTING, for future profits.  There will be good days, bad days, lots of people selling today, but also MANY BUYING.  Go outside, have fun. If you put money in you are TRUSTING THAT IT WILL GROW.   Don't let anything fool you, everyone wether they are saying it or not, wants GME. Sure, the big bad guys are trying to drop it, but do you know how much power they have? If they wanted it would be over already.  As long as we buy and/or hold, it will rise, I don't know how much will it take, but that's what should happen.  I'm losing right now, A LOT. Am I worried? Nope, not at all, becuase I believe in ALL OF US, the real ones, y'all know who you are. And we will take this to whatever we want to, it is just a matter of time.  TL;DR: STAY FUCKING CALM, ENJOY LIFE.
Make some money or make a confusing point?
What you all have done is amazing, throws a spotlight on the fact that the markets are easily and frequently manipulated.  You have the attention of the major players, but little else.  They know it's a matter of time before you all go broke and they make their money anyway, and for what?  It's not about what's right or fair, definitely not about snarky memes and childish fantasies, it's about money.  Why not use this new found power to band together and make some actual money.  Whats next to buy?    Let's brag about new sneakers, paying for college, donate to a favorite charity, a new tesla or vacation home.
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, bags are heavy, there's vomit on his sweater already, bananas
To all you apes still holding the line- you're golden. This is your moment. This isn't about money. This is about right vs wrong. Poor vs rich.   DO NOT DESPAIR!   You do not have a loss until you sell. This is not the time to sell. Consider this your tuition. Your cost of entry. People pay for degrees and get nothing. You paid for a stock, you paid for an INVESTMENT and you are now a part owner of GME, and you might just be the part owner of GME for life!   You didnt lose. You are a part of history. The question is, which side are you on?   Obviously this is not investment advice. I'm just a rare snow-ape from Northern Canada     3 shares of GME @ $250 (all this poor monkey could afford)
Hey I'm new here just wanted to ask does the gamestop thing still goes on?
Question's in the title. Thx for your answers!
Blockbuster is trending and seeing gains
Looking for some input before I start posting this on my social media.
TLDR:      " Career politicians:      Remember who you represent, remember who you are charged with protecting      In case you forgot, here is a reminder:      -The PEOPLE.      -The everyday Joe and Jane      -Democrats, Republicans and the groups between      You stand for David, stop cowering behind Goliath"    \#GME #AMC #DiamondHands #HowIsThisSystemNotRigged #DFV  This is the first time that I have been actively involved with my social media accounts. I Really believe it would help our cause to SERIOUSLY start calling out the politicians who are too coward to do their job.  My current stance on the matter is:  " Career politicians:  \-Remember who you represent  \-Remember who you are charged with protecting  In case you forgot, here is a reminder:  \-The PEOPLE.  \-The everyday Joe and Jane  \-Democrats, Republicans and the groups between  You stand for David, stop cowering behind Goliath  \#GME"  Here are some further thoughts of mine.  Should we allow incompetent cops to continue to hold their positions? NO  Should incompetent doctors to continue practicing medicine? NO  Are humans perfect and expected to be perfect every time? NO  So why should we continue to support these politicians who clearly do not have the publics interest in mind? Why should we allow these career politicians to keep their positions despite their complete lack of action to protect the people?  Please, I leave this thread open for constructive discussions and debates.
GME isn't short term anymore, it's mid-long term.
Hello smooth brains  I'm going to break down the GME investors here into two categories.  One group bought GME because the believed the company was going to turn around and they saw long term value like DFV did.  The second group wanted to ride the hype, cash in on easy tendies, then bail.    While some people in group two may move over to group one, most have and will bail on this stock and that's fine, let them.  Group one however which is likely who is making all the hold posts, will not bail.  DFV lost millions on his current holdings and he as of now has no intention on bailing, he believes in GME and knows it's going places.  Yes he sold some and he was smart for doing so as now he is set for life but he still took a temporary loss on 20+ million because he believes in the company.  Is GME going to moon this week or next?  Probably not, it might just keep dropping until we get another catalyst to turn it around.  If you haven't noticed Gamestop has been very very quit during all of this and I am certain a large part of that is corporate lawyers telling them to keep their mouth shut so if they get accused of stock manipulation there will be nothing to support it.    Is the dip a bad thing though?  I don't think so, what it's doing is giving us the ability to really get into GME at a great price.  The more it goes down, the further your dollar is going to take you.  simply put 1 share at $150 is 3 shares at $50, making your purchase 3 times more powerful.  You can try to time it out and buy at what you assume it the low point, or you can average down, buying up a few shares every time it drops a decent amount.    One happy day Cohen is going to announce his plans or some massive deal he made, and that is going to turn the stock green again.  He's not an idiot and hey made his move on GameStop because he knows he can do something big. People like to argue that you can buy games anywhere but it's branding that matters most.  Remember you could buy pet supplies anywhere when he started chewy and look how that turned out.  This time though, he has a powerful brand name already going for him (and a massive amount of free advertisement from us)  Also keep in mind once Wall Street realizes they are not a failing company anymore, they will also start to pile into it.  Lets remember BlackRock owns 9,217,335  shares.  Yes they sold 2 million shares, but they unloaded a small chunk just like DFV did, but  kept the majority of their holdings.    Overall if you believe in the company keep holding and average down if you can.  I bought in at $20, $21, $25, and $30 so I am averaging up but hey I like the stock.  If you bought in because you wanted easy $$$ and missed out, you just need to decide on what to do yourself.  It's not a short term play anymore and you need to ask yourself if that's something your ok with.  Again it's all perspective and not financial advice.  It's your money (and probably your banks because you borrowed) so you decide what to do.

GME: Hedge fund insider reporting
Edit: this is not financial advice  As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.  First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.  Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust.  In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.  This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.  Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves     If you monkeys like to read some formal definition of this behavior, read this     If you don't understand it, read again, this explains why you don't sell and you need to stick together
Wow literally have been on the subreddit all week and didn't see any posts regarding biotechnology stocks. This is clear media manipulation, anyone just by viewing wsb can see this is not true. Hold fast r/wallstreetbets. Eventually the truth will come out.
Why would I sell only to get back 22% of my investment?
I feel like everyone sold and just lied to us about holding lmao
Real talk should I drop my 2 shares while they are still worth anything??

$YALA is a buy? Looks like it about to move. I like the stock.
Anyone looking at $YALA. Recently went IPO and is moving lately. Does anyone have some DD? Is this going   ?  I like the stock.
Who is panicking?
I see too many panic posts here. If you are panicking, you made a bad decision and you should not be here.  We went from 3M subs to   This sub is screwed with all those retards here that not belong. If you came here thinking you would earn some easy money by jumping of the bridge together with everyone else, not thinking how you were gonna land, accept your loss and move on.   I see people blaming other people to sell. If you are not planning on paying eachothers bills, you don’t have the right to judge someone’s financial decisions.  Especially when you bought 1 share and there are people in with several K, that might actually realize they are pissing away money.
Institutional buying on MMNFF? Up 30% today to .22
I don’t see any news to signify the move. This stock has generally been hammered as they’ve restructured leadership. Anybody have any intel?
This is the next $NIO.... BUY THE DIPS
Where can I go to get the WSB experience minus GME?
Looking to discuss and learn about pretty much anything other than meme stocks. Would be great if this sub could have an option to filter all that out. Otherwise I’m hoping someone knows another good sub.
Well backed up confirmation bias chain, AMC.
Apes lead apes to greatness. These diamond hands don't buckle.                Apes together strong
There isn’t enough loss porn right now. I might not have a lot of hands in GME, but the ones I have are     Hold Fast!
Might as well hold now
We’re in the smack middle of it now, no point in selling. HOLD INTO THE PITS OF OBLIVION!!!
When do I collect premium?
New to writing contracts and was wondering if someone could answer my question.   On Monday I sold a Put for a premium of $190, taking the obligation to sell shares at a strike price of $15. The stock went way up so the Put’s value went way down so I decided to simply close out of the Put as I had made about $170 of that $190 in those two days. When will I be paid those $170? I don’t see that it has appeared in my buying power. Do I have to wait until 2/19 (when the option would’ve expired) before I collect it even if I buy back the contract? It’s been about an hour since I closed out of it so I think it would’ve synced by now if it was just taking a while. If someone could answer this please lmk
Anyone else hate the scrolling banner at the top of this sub? Love the sub, hate the banner.
Just curious If it's just me... fucks with my eyes.   AMC still holding btw.
Can we stop beating the dead horse that is GME and get back to making memes, solid DD, and money?
Many of us  beat ANREW FUCKING LEFT. It was proven that Wallstreet is stacked against the retail invester.  If it continues to be just people desperately trying to pump GME then this sub will die.  Let's find other companies to invest in and make some damn Tendies.  I wish you guys would realise all that was accomplished.
RETARD NEEDS HELP - GME - Data & More
I have compiled shortvolume data, price data, and fail to deliver data.  I am trying to get as much data together as possible to understand this situation.  This will help for the current situation & if this situation ever arises again we have a road map of what to expect.  FILE IS HERE:       I put an overview tab of some data together, but do not know enough yet to make sense of everything. Nor to give an in detail explanation of what means what.    Lets figure out how to start creating tools to help this community.  I am a back-end engineer, if any frond-end engineers want to help build some web apps, I am down.  I'll pay hosting & domain costs as well.  IT IS ABOUT TIME WE START CREATING TOOLS BASED ON OUR COMMUNITY DD THAT WILL HELP IDENTIFY OPPORUTINITY WITHIN THIS SUB.    There are a lot of smart people in here who understand how to value companies, we should be learning how to educate ourselves further.
Short DD on STLA
Hey all, amidst all the GME madness, I’d like to share a ticker I think could be great in the next few years. It’s a little EV company called Stellantis (STLA). Stellantis is an EV manufacturing corporation with deals with companies such as FCA and Peugeot. It just recently opened for public trading on the market. They plan to have 39 different EVs made by 2022.   What makes this pick so great in my opinion is, of course, Joe Biden. Not just Biden being there, however. Joe Biden has announced plans to convert the entire federal fleet into EVs. What company does the federal government use for the most part? Dodge,  which is owned by FCA . With Stellantis very likely producing these EVs, we could see a very healthy surge in the company’s value.   Pretty short DD, I know, but I think this has the potential to be a great long term pick.   Positions: 20 shares @  , 2 01/2023 $30c contracts Positions will increase once I’m not in metric tones of debt  Edit: my dumb ass forgot Cadillac was GM

Buying in at $50 usd
Really considering buying in at $50usd, probably $600 worth.  Talk me out of it.
Kmon guys. One last haul!! Let’s get the numbers up again! We can do it! Buy now it’s low!
I'VE LOST 89 THOUSAND EUROS. CAME FOR THE TENDIES, STAYED FOR THE WAR AGAINST SHORTERS.
I'm down EUR 89,  with my Gamestop stocks. Made a fat profit first, reinvested most of that profit at the very top, only to be assfucked by Robin Hood and the hedge fund shorter cunts. I'm very sure the stock would have catapulted to EUR 500 and beyond, had it not been for the blatant market manipulation we all saw happening in broad daylight. I'm down 86% and I'm gonna hold, at this point I don't care if it goes down to fucking zero. Nothing's fundamentally changed about the situation with Gamestop. They're still massively shorted, I strongly believe in the company's future after the management shakeup and the latest announcements yesterday, and I will do my part to not let the bastards win. I'm not a rational actor, I'm here to see what happens and I've got all the time in the world. Do what you will, brothers and sisters, but I'm living proof of the sunk cost fallacy. The best course of action, in my opionion, is to WAIT and HOLD if you can afford it.  Disclaimer for our friends at the SEC: I'm not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. Do your own research. You may lose your entire investment. Yada yada.    for the SEC: investigate and punish the market manipulators within the financial system instead of going after individual retail investors. If it continues to be cheaper for them to blatantly manipulate the markets and make money by defrauding retail investors because they'll pay a fine that doesn't equal or exceed their losses they avoided by behaving irresponsibly, they will never learn, and nothing will ever change.
Hold fast to $GME and prepare for the plunge to $48. That was the price when the bum rush started and HF shorties are shaking loose the last scardey-shares from early  $130)

AMC- Dave Portnoy buys back in.
February 4, 2021 01:12 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News       Dave Portnoy said he purchased $700,000 worth of   AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc   (NYSE:         shares Wednesday.         What Happened:   The Barstool Sports owner told Fox Business host Stuart Varney that he bought back into the theater chain after exiting positions in the Reddit hot stocks earlier on Tuesday.       “I put in $700,000 into AMC this morning,” Portnoy told Varney, adding that he was “up” $60,000 on his investment.
Will be buying more when funds clear
GME / AMC / BB     holding tips
First off, some of you apes   need to chill the fuck out. Getting all worked up over this is gonna cause you to make some poor decisions, if you haven’t already.  Some of you YOLO’d your life savings, some of you FOMO’d hard chasing the moon   shot and lambos, and some of you threw down money just to be part of history. I’m not your financial advisor and I won’t make decisions for you, but emotion does not have a place in the stock market. Make rational, logical decisions. And be skeptical of EVERYONE around here because people constantly try to manipulate you and pump stocks for their own gain.  If you’re bag holding these meme stocks but truly believe they have potential, then quit crying about it and sit down in the rocket   with us and strap the fuck in. It’s gonna make another run but you may have to wait a few weeks or even months for it to launch again, potentially. Set some Price Alerts on your phone and stop obsessing over every tiny fucking move.   It WILL go down more before it goes back up. If you can buy more, buy more. If you can’t, then Keep Calm strap in for the wild ride.
Calling in from the UK with a small handful of shares in GME, AMC and BB. Just letting you know if you’re in, we’re in. Diamond hands... unite!    🌕
1 GME, 8 AMC and 6 BB. All I could afford but doing my bit!
To all the paper hands wanting to press that SELL button : if you held B-i-t-c-o-i-n in 2018 and held it until now, you can HOLD GME till 2023.
Just delete that trading app from your phone and reinstall it in 3 years.
You realize that a gigantic slide is necessary before the hedge funds even think about covering their shorts, right? HOLD THOSE SHARES.
Did you really think they were going to cover at 300 dollars a share? Or 150? Or even 90?  DIAMOND. HANDS.
I am holding to always remind myself how dumb I was

It’s been a week
Ray Dalio voice: "What do we know, and what we don't know"
What we know:  Ladder attacks have basically been disproven  Failure-to-delivers are high  The sentiment is low due to FUD     What we don't know:  Any and all HF legal and illicit strategies to drive $GME down (sitting around $60 as of this post)  Naked shorts are getting confused with borrowing borrowed shares  Whether or not HFs have (diamond hands)\ 2     I am not trying to spread FUD, but I also don't want to hold and pray for a whale to swoop in, especially if the game comes down to who has the most capital, because we know who wins if that's the case.  I implore everyone to keep the memes, emojis, and general degenerate inclinations at bay for just one post. Graphs and data are encouraged.
Have the apes given up?
I looked here yesterday, saw by the dip, hold, diamond hand baby apes. Saw a bunch of people reassuring others. Where'd the ape faith go? Am I the only one still clutching to GME? Well, it's low enough now that if I sold put now, I'd lose all the money invested. Not complaining, just concerned. Where's all the support for one another we had the passed week? ARE WE NOT APES  Edit: Wow, alot of comments. I bought more this morning. It dropped so low that I literally just dumped the rest of my investing money while I was drinking my coffee. I figured something fishy was happening. But I saw alot of really down people when skimming the sub. So I was hoping to initiate a positive push that we've been having the rest of the week. Thank yall.
Exercise me pussies. I WANT THE SHARES. I LIKE THE STOCK.   🏻
In case you wondered who is selling
" 2021-01-28 - Must Asset Management Inc. has filed an SC 13G/A form with the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing ownership of 0 shares of GameStop Corp. (US:GME). This represents   percent ownership of the company. In their previous filing dated 2020-03-20, Must Asset Management Inc.  had reported owning 3,300,000 shares, indicating a decrease of   percent."

How long should it take to open a fineco trading account?
I opened it 2 days ago and it said it would be a few hours. It's been 2 days. I'm trying to join in the gme bants but it's tricky when you can't actually trade.
Deactivating Robinhood. Once this squeeze is over, find yourself a proper broker.
Don’t let the super bots that r driving both gme and amc down the same exact way scare you.
No one else noticing these bots fluctuating both gme and amc exactly the same way? It’s a tactic to scare us n make us sell... please understand this you noobs.
Worried about losses?
TL/DR: Don’t be because of legitimate reasons so breathe.    Everyone here has had their (pun unintended) share of losses. We even have an entire loss porn section because red candles get our rocks off. Despite that, there are literally millions of retards who are holding for reasons that I won’t get into right now. A little DD on the subreddit will explain most things. You can easily find the general bullet points about this whole short squeeze  .  Did you click it? If so, skip to       RETARDS      .   If not, seriously.  Click it .  Still no? Then I would put more trust in the logic behind the millions or get out since you refused to research the logic yourself, let alone click a link lmao. Yes, nothing is a guarantee when it comes to the market but in this particular circumstance you have every reason to buy/hold and only one reason to sell: You’re WEAK. Am I being crass? No and you need to develop those loss calluses, preferably sooner than later. This squeeze could take weeks or months to come to fruition so if you haven’t started buckling down yet you should get to it but if you’re ready to go full-retard with us then   buy the dips, hold for anything else  .        RETARDS    :   You already know what it is. Keep at it, fuckers.  DDD by    PPosition:   @ $    NNot a money guy or whatever they’re called. Just a moron, even by an ape’s standards.
Keep holding FFS
Ryan Cohen is in.  DFV is in  millions of others are still fucking in.  Entry @   and still fucking in
HOLD GME — Don’t let it consume you.
Like many of you, I have been laser focused on the ups and downs of GME, but no matter how much I look at it, it doesn’t change the fact that I’m still going to HOLD.   Take 15 minutes that you would otherwise spend staring at GME in your underpants and open a new brokerage account (not Robinhood), fund it, and then take a break while you wait for the funds to transfer.   Go on a walk. Buy something local. Try talking to a girl. Read a book. Learn something. Research other other new, exciting, and innovative companies for your next investment. Do something other than stare at GME.   When it comes times to make moves on GME, you’ll know.
Stop it with GME.
Just stop it and think for a second.   You have been a victim, you’ve been defrauded. Those whales including a few members up here has taken your money and ran away.    Suggesting people to buy this stock is not going to help. Their money is NOTHING compared to those fat cats. you will create more victims then necessary.   Please open your eyes. don’t be delusional.

I LOVE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU.
I am new to this subreddit and I have learned a few things.  Y'all are NOT Apes  Y'all are NOT Retards  What the majority of people here are MEN!!! MEN with principles. Men who are willing to sacrifice personal wealth for the betterment of all.   I salute each and everyone of you
GME and AMC prices are being ARTIFICIALLY lowered
Look at both charts and see how similar they are. Hedgies do this all the time to try and bankrupt companies so they win everything.   But since we're here they can't and will feel the burn as long as you hold.
I am holding  ✊ ✊ ✊ ✊
Bought in 30 shares @ 225 average.  Yes its getting to me Yes i hate wall street right now  But I am holding till $0, its all or nothing now
We needed a “commitment device”
First off,   🏻  until the end.  IDGAF. It’s a badge of pride now. No matter what happens, I’m extremely proud of this sub.  That said, we needed even more resolve.  How do you better hold a virtual, anonymous group together? A commitment device. Something everyone opts into doing that transparently signals we are still fucking in it.  Maybe something like a thread where you publicly post your position everyday and aggregating it into a metric of how   🏻 you are. Rankings maybe. I don’t know, something like that. Something that makes it tougher to slink away as the heat rises, and celebrate the iron willed.
Its not over yet!
Doing what I can to help, its not much but it is something.   32 shares at 67!  Lets do this!
HFs played ya'll like a damn fiddle
These fake freakouts last week. The fake concern.. Haha they fabricated it all. I'm not surprised if they intentionally inflated the price over the weekekend to sucker more buyers.  Once this is all settled the HFs got one over on ya'll big time.  Its OK don't sell that's fine but eventually the delusions will fade  These rich guys just had the best belly laughs they've ever had  Imagine trying to stick it to a cheater playing a rigid game where they make the rules you have to follow and they don't   SMH
Fidelity sold my GME shares without my permission after TD ameritrade cancelled my transfer!
All my money was in TD ameritrade and I initiated a transfer of funds into fidelity. Everything went smooth. The next two days after the cash settled, I then called fidelity to buy GME. They said the money wasn’t fully transferred but since I had enough cash in my account (not margin) that they I could make trades. I made a trade on the phone with the fidelity broker and they told me everything was fine. Td ameritrade said there was some error and cancelled the trade. So I initiated a wire transfer to my chase to then wire it over to my fidelity but before I could do so fidelity sold my GME and AMC at the current -70% of my account.   I called everyday this week to both brokers and they all said it’s going through great. Technically, I haven’t lost any money because my actual cash is in my chase bank but fidelityhas a negative balance and I’m considering not even putting it into fidelity now.   What should I do? Should I go to another broker? I’m currently on hold with fidelity.
Exciting hypothesis for a boring stock KO
I am fairly confident Topo Chico Hard Seltzer will be introduced during the Super Bowl.   If you are unfamiliar this is Coca Cola's first forray into alcoholic beverages since the 80's, in an extremely hot segment, don't believe me? Check your wife's boyfriends pantry, its full of hard seltzers, and pregnancy tests.  Coca Cola, curiously, is vocal about them presenting zero ads themselves during the Superbowl, saying they're "excited to watch from the sidelines". This is not common for them to sit out the biggest event of the year.  Meanwhile Molson Coors, which has the exclusive rights to market Topo Chico in the US, has been vocal that they are 'introducing new products with an introductory ad   during the super bowl'.   Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is already available in a few countries, and reviews are generally favorable, but if America is drawn to Topo Chico like an ape is drawn to emojis then we can see a huge lift in KO's stock price with this super bowl ad 'blitz' (haha!! Ha..)  Or, because I'm not a financial advisor and eat shit for breakfast, i could end up getting KO'd on my March Expiry 55c's (of which I've bought ten.)
Daily post to remind you your positions in this meme stock are stupid
After going through a lot of the post history of these GME rally retards I see a common trend. You know nothing about the market or stocks. You’ve literally hopped on the bandwagon thinking you’re part of some movement to destroy hedge funds. Hate to break it to you (coming from a guy who’s lost a lot myself in options over the years) you’re in a losing game with GME.  Was this GME rally a week ago something interesting? Sure, but if you think for a second the hedge fund buddies aren’t helping each other out and dumping the stock on you plebs you’re just beyond retarded.   Blaming small brokers like RH for your retard move of buying shares and not understanding how laws force brokers to carry multiples of liquid cash shows again your retardation.   I welcome the new autists and your interest in the market, do some research and maybe learn options. Dump your money into some FDs, laugh about the losses. But focusing on GME and thinking you’re somehow going to rally a shit stock with bad fundamentals because 8mil people are here shows you’re just insane and need to find a new hobby.
Hedge funds can eat shit.
The bot crew has infiltrated the subreddit, They are all over telling you to sell and lose your stocks. If you sell they win. Melvin is not out of the game they are deep in the game doing everything they can to screw you over and reduce their position more.     Suck it bots, you cant sway my diamond hands.  I didnt come here to make money, I came here to stick it to hedge funds.     "Yous guys are the ones who are the ball lickers. We will make you eat our shit, then shit out our shit, then eat your shit which is made up of our shit which we made you eat." - Jason Mewes
Watch a Movie, Play a Game, Diamond Hands are here to Stay
Do nothing and we win. Put your mouth where your money is, or better yet your actions. Watch a movie (AMC) instead of worrying about how far down you are. Play a game (GME) instead of watching the ticker all day. Do literally nothing, and we win. GameStop didn’t get to almost $500 by sheer luck. AMC didn’t get to $20+ because we were playing games. They reached these heights because we saw POTENTIAL in these stocks, we like these stocks 😎       “But movies are only streaming now”... really? Yeah, Trolls 2 opted for streaming. Sure, Mulan opted for streaming—whatever. But even... TENET opted for streaming, but guess what? They barely broke even in the box office. Mulan flopped. Trolls did well, but let’s face it, crying kids shouldn’t be in the theaters in the first place so playing their movies at home is actually a better idea anyway. But THEATER movies? There’s a reason why the new Bond movie has been finished since last April and delayed until post COVID. They’d rather sell 4 $20 tickets than 1 $30+ PPV. Hollywood makes most of their $$ from ticket sales, whereas theaters profit from the concessions, but you already knew that. The point is, Hollywood would NEVER let a cash flow like that go out of business and start releasing movies only at home.  Let me ask you an honest question: Anyone else heard about the Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire trio rumored for Spider-Man 3? You think Marvel would EVER release that directly to Disney plus? Have you ever been to any Marvel movie ever in lMAX / Dolby opening night? The energy is UNPRECEDENTED.   Robert Pattinson’s Batman, new James Bond, King’s Man, Pirates of the Caribbean reboot, Ready Player 2... the list goes on. These are, for the most part, THEATER movies. Surrounded by fans and overpriced icees, buttery popcorn and your nerdy gf that loves that shit more than you do. THATS the value of a movie theater, and AMC does it best, so in my humble opinion they’re not going anywhere.  And on top of all of that, we HOLD with some shiny     then boom... to the fucking moon baby. Simple maths, more demand = higher price. Now you still believe we’re just a big cluster of degenerates throwing money at a casino? Okay, maybe. But is it a hell of a good guess? I think so. But what do I know? I’m just a stupid ape that hedge fund suits with slicked back hair and AXE body spray profit off of, and this isn’t financial advice  ‍♂️
Buckle up everyone, we're going for a wild ride from here.
It's going to happen, I can just imagine Elon depositing 500 million just to fuck with the Hedge Funds. The HF almost fucked him up a few years ago and then insulted him laughing about how much they made off him with shorts. He's pissed, he's been pissed & the fact is Elon Musk has a personal grudge with HF's and is also the richest man in the world. This could mean great disruption if he buys & could make us finally defeat the bastards. Remember what they say, buy on the rumor. I just hope this rumor is true you fucking retards.
People keep going on about how we're all in the stages of grief.. How we're all in denial....
Let's try   Acceptance    I accepted that I am a retard when I shot out from the womb on my rocket    I accepted that by being a retard, my pitiful money was nothing more than tokens to exchange for fuel for said rocket     I accepted that if and when that money I accrued being a retard burned as I left the atmosphere in my rocket, I might loop around the moon and fire into the sun like a queef in the wind      I accepted that when my retarded barely functioning rocket would inevitably spiral past mercury, I'd look out of the window and I'd see a million other crooked rockets and various other bits of airborne belt-fed autistic capsules filled with apes      hurling into the sun with me       I accepted that although we might pass the beings known as cubanoids and muskalons 🛸 they wouldn't save us, and would instead merely observe us as the lower autistic intelligences that we are as we all hurl into sol itself        I accepted that if I have to take my shares into the fucking sun with me, I fucking will. Diamonds    were made in the stars ⭐ and my hands    would only be going fucking home anyway ☀️        But I ain't going into the fucking sun, even if my ship is on fire and my money has been burned, I will slingshot my rocket around that bitch and set out for pluto anyway. It might take me a year to get there but I'm fucking getting there.        🪐  This is not space travel advise, I'm just a retard with a ship.
Wild ride
Had GME from a year or two ago at $5 a pop, has been a wild ride watching the gains explode and dwindle, just gonna hold onto mine because i like the stock.  I remember being a little kid and my mom throwing my sister and I in the car and driving 2 hours to a remote GameStop to get us gameboy SPs.  I’m in it because despite hating their trade in policy, GameStop has been an influential part of my life since i was little.  I hope they never go under.  I don’t know anything about investing so don’t take this as advice, but it feels good to see a company you love succeed.
Is GME done?
I'm still holding, but it's not looking good at all. Even when the hedge funds buy back, will it be too late?
I'm here til its at fucking $4 fuck all those billionaire fuckers.
I'm not selling I could afford to lose it and ill lose it if I need to fuck em.
There is no way I will sell. I'm so disgusted at the manipulation and it has nothing to do with money!
I can safely say I have never been more disgusted by the suits. After reading up on previous crashes because of the financial scum I will not let my shares go.  They are manipulating and getting away with it! I will stand and stand firm.
IDIOTS EVERYWHERE
I dont know what i can tell as a trend but you morons are still pushing. We get knocked down and there is still volume up! They are trying to keep pushing but there is more and more money they are dropping in to try and knock down the price. HOLD TRUE!!!!!!  these spikes are incredible, there is still a drive for the stonks to go up!!!
WSJ reporter sent chat request
Said she’d like to interview me. I’m pretty sure that my 33 shares don’t warrant a WSJ interview. What gives?
$MINE 100000 @ .0019. Threw $200 away to a penny stock because I’m bored
Thanks Fidelity for letting me buy Penny Stocks. If this makes it even close to a dollar you guys can smell my ass from my Tesla.   Minerco, Inc has Pink status and opened at .0017. Projected pricing for 2026 is   as listed by Yahoo Finance. If you search for the company it’s trying to lead the Magic Mushroom market. I said fuck it since I’m just waiting on $GME.
AMC
I only bought 7 shares   why the fuck would i sell now? I only know buy more
I'm Sick - Why Am I ENJOYING The Down Trend?
Listen I cant claim a YOLO but im in and clearly I am down, at first it hurt, I was scared, feeling panicked, but now for some reason I actually enjoy seeing this loss and the reason is primarily because of VOLUME!!!! Its telling all of us that we are standing strong against the Hedgies. If we were seeing volume in the 100mill+ range id be convinced you retards were selling but to see the price tank with such low volumes tells me the hedgies are attacking the price.   All logic tells us if there is a shortage of sellers prices will go up, unless of course there are no buys (and come on I'm buying every dip I can afford like the rest), then how on earth would we see a price dip if truly those here are not selling? there are two answers weak paper hands closing on a loss (sorry for your loss) and hedgies doing everything they can to kill the price. Stay strong FAM we will prevail!  Hope to see other chime in with their prospective on what we are seeing today, Its very clear to me but hope to hear others thoughts around volume, movement, and prediction.     I am a dipshit, and this is not finical advice!
Total ducking newb here.
I got swept up in the trading game you all seem to be having fun doing. I'm still waiting for my money to clear before I can start eating crayon's with the rest of you. I think I'm going to have fun riding these huge waves I've been seeing. Can't wait to get to the moon!
Why are we worrying?
Isn’t this exactly like the Volkswagen squeeze? It was up, came down hard, then rocketed up? We won’t know for sure until 2/9, but if it’s true that HF haven’t closed out of their positions then that’ll be the catalyst that triggers it because all the paper hands will come back.
Just bought in
Only one share bc I’m broke but I can afford to lose that money  Let’s fucking go boys
Some takeaways
Since im graduating in the spring and will be incurring a ton of student debt with no job lined up, i bought into the hype to cash out. Well i knew what i was getting myself into.   I previously was never interested in learning stocks. I thought it would be too much time and effort to teach myself. The amount of reading and new information i have absorbed is amazing.   My shares in GME are just acting as a savings account thats not in bank. (As a student i get basically zero interest in my savings account)     TIME TO LET GME MARINATE    As a full time student and working 25 hours a week i do not have it in me to day trade. This last week my eyes have been glued to the phone. I have not been efficient with my time.   I am going to use a platform that automatically trades stocks and ETFs. Instead of having money in my savings account not earning interest, i believe having it sit in an investment count will do me right in the years to come.   Other new investors, what were your takeaways?
Bought in to wait for feb 9th shitard DD
Here are my amateur investor/gambler thoughts, this is still wallstreetBETS right?  Today $GME is down as much as it has been during this rally. The hype is not there and that is ok.  Right  now, shorted stocks are the hottest things for retail traders and I'm  sure fund managers have noticed. They know the SEC filing on shorts is  Feb. 9th. That is the ONLY time we will know anything about the funds  short positions during this rally.  I  think, that there will be another rally, leading up to Feb 9th. I  bought in on todays dip, in hopes of the stock shooting up before Feb  9th. The rally may go past feb 9th, depending on the short positions  posted.    THIS  IS A HUGE GAMBLE. Fuck yeah. But if I can double my $$$, great. I might  lose half my money, oh well. I'm glad I have other holdings. YOLO  My position is 70 shares at 72$. I feel like an asshole for not buying at 69$ and for that I am sorry.  THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I'M JUST A NEWLY MINTED GAMBLING ADDICT WITH A SMOOTH BRAIN FOR STOCKS.
Wish I didn't buy GME
So I could buy it at such a good discount!!  Holding the bag for the 400 bros.  Volume moved around is so low. Compared to last week     HOLD!!!!! Ape together retarded strong.      I aint hear no bell!!
This isn’t the end
Just Bought 8 more shares. I’ve got a hell of a Ape Grip and not letting go   👊
What's AMC worth?
Lots of posts here lately discussing the future (or lack thereof) of AMC Entertainment Holdings.  For a quick DD, let's compare their stats pre-pandemic and today:    Pre-pandemic:   in January 2020, AMC traded around $7/share, and had a market cap of $700M.  19Q3 revenues were $     Now:   in January 2021 just before the recent runup, AMC traded around $ , and had a market cap of $400M, accounting for the successive share dilutions.  20Q3 revenues were $   Their revenues fell 90% Y/Y, they have massive debt of over $5B, they've diluted their shares, and their cash flow is horrid.  Even if they ever get revenues back to pre-pandemic levels (which may take years, and they still have to make their debt payments),    they'd be worth only $4-5 because of the dilution   , assuming the market will pay the same multiple as pre-pandemic.  Disclaimers: This is not financial advice.  I'm a nobody.  Data source:
Don't be swindled
Don't let wall street swindle you, but more importantly don't swindle yourself.
Let’s be real about this
The majority of the people watching this sub, commenting to hold and talking about their “dIaMoNd HaNdS” were never going to hold.  It’s basically an operation by everyone individually being selfish enough to tell others to hold until they can sell their shit for a good price - and look what happened? Exactly that.  There was  never  going to be some “us against them” war going on, cause everyone realistically had a price in which they’d bail.  Edit: Thanks for gold, I don’t feel brave or edgy for speaking the truth, but in case it wasn’t clear, I didn’t buy a single AMC or GME stock, as I have been contemplating back and forth since this all started   but   if I did, I would have  basically  said anything and agreed with everyone and hyped them up to keep holding for me for a good price.
Put $600 more into GME & AMC. I WAS BORN FOR THE STORM, AND I LIKE THE STOCK!
Today seemed like a good day to make sure I really am retarded. I put even more money into this weird little app on my phone.  Up to $2,800 in the two stocks I'LL NEVER SELL!  I SEE RED!
I’m one of many who’ve learned valuable lessons this past week.
I’ve been a lurker here since about September, made little to no trades, with the only profit I made being from turning Marathon from $3 and change to $7 and change as a free stock. Like many, I saw the GME fiasco as a “free money glitch”. I was uninformed, did little to no research, and immediately poured $700 that I probably couldn’t afford to lose into GME. When it’d drop from 300 down to 200, I’d panic and sell, just trying to get something in return. This happened until the $700 was $189, and I felt like I was the biggest retard known to man. Although I pissed my money away and would’ve been better off wiping my ass with it, we hurt the suits. That’s bigger than money. I’m just a broke college student halfway towards a business degree, and this situation could have implications for years to come.   So far I’ve learned:  - Do your research on the situation before you invest.  - Sometimes the real profit comes from fucking the suits raw.   - Don’t panic when it drops, you’re playing into the suits’ plan, they’re probably sitting there beating off at the thought of potentially millions of retards like myself throwing their money away.  - You haven’t lost money until you sell, likewise you haven’t made money until you sell.  - Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.  - Feeling depressed after a loss is normal, and you will not profit off of every stock.   Hopefully this will help some of the newer members like myself who have been considering hopping in. This sub has gained over 5 million new members in the past week. Please do your research, be informed, and do not invest more than you can afford to lose.   I’d like to thank everyone in the WSB community, the past week has been fun. At one point I was +500 and change and I got greedy, thinking $1000 a share was “realistic” and happening. Regardless of my loss, we’ve done more to Wall Street than anyone has ever, just off of one stock. The future is bright.
Let’s be realistic
This is probably going to get removed but what do you guys think is actually going to happen from here , how does it possibly bounce back ?
I want to buy GME
I am really tempted to dump a LOT of money into GME right now that it's below 100$ per share. Why should I? Will this actually come off? I'm an investor not a speculator, so would appreciate some solid advice.
Buy more AMC or I will lose my home.
Holding the line and waiting for better days. Will lose everything unless AMC decides to go green.  I just want more but now I soon have to leave my house.  My solution? Buy more AMC.   I'm not a financial advisor.
Winning is not holding all the way to $0
For whoever needs to hear this. Holding to zero and losing money isn’t sticking it to Wall Street. Making profit and thereby transferring their cash to your account is how you win.
Time's almost up
Fellow retards, autists, retardettes and basement dwellers, time is almost up. If your wife's boyfriend has any money to spare buy AMC before it's too late. We have another 10-14 days before take off and trust me, you want to be on this rocket      Not advice just a retard that likes the stonk
SHORT INTEREST IN GME at 23% now
Guys this thing is a MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!!! Don't let anyone convince you to buy now. If they are still pumping GME it isnt for the cause, it's because they bought in at 300 and need you to buy their shares off them lol  I know we're all retard, but dont be an idiot lol
Please, help me recover part of my loses..
Well, you got me. You convinced me this was an heroic fight against the evil forces of Wall street and in the end, some of you were just scammers trying to steal money from the rest of us, this time by making us believe in something that was just a joke.  Ok, well played.  Now, you could help me back by just visiting my youtube channel, The Crazy Channel, and watch a video or two. If just some of you do, I could recover part of my losses, so, please, do it and, at least, I won't think you all are ape retards.     I can't put direct links, but just look for The Crazy Channel in YT, and we're the channel with 14400 subs.      I trust you will help a fellow retard still holding.
The people at this point calling others Melvins are actually HELPING Melvin. Lol, the irony.
Have fun staying in the red while you got the nerve to call others pussies and Melvin. Melvin actually appreciates ur contribution.
FUD
anyone else think all of these 'i couldn't take it and sold for a loss' posts springing up are fake and trying to spread fear?
GFamsa A performing almost +200% today
The stock it's dirt cheap but increasing by twice it's value in a day.  Just wanted to share.  Don't let this opportunity distract you from GME and AMC.
🤚HOLDING. 75% DOWN. WHERE IS YOUR FAITH APES? ARE YOU HOLDING? AM I OUT HERE ALONE? I'LL RIDE THIS TO ZERO. 🤚
I'm just watching my wife get nailed by her boyfriend and playing Animal Crossing. This is not financial advice. I'm a retard eating mashed bananas.
Sharp price drops over 3-5 minute periods
Can someone explain this phenomenon we're seeing today to me? What's \ actually\  happening to facilitate that?  Is it ladder attacks, genuine lack of demand, or something my monkey brain hasn't guessed yet.  Position: picked up 10 more just now at $  because I feel like something's up. Got my first at $325 just in case the rocked launched.  Having more fun than I did all 2020.  Edit: Pro GME and or pro hold comments are getting deleted. If anyone can even see this
We have to unit !
That quote summarizes it all:  "History provides  evidence for the crucial importance of large-scale cooperation. Victory almost invariably went to those who cooperated better – not only in struggles between Homo sapiens and other animals, but also in conflicts between different human groups. Thus Rome conquered Greece not because the Romans had larger brains or better toolmaking techniques, but because they were able to cooperate more effectively.  Throughout history, disciplined armies easily routed disorganised hordes, and unified elites dominated the disorderly masses.  (...)  In order to mount a revolution, numbers are never enough. Revolutions are usually made by small networks of agitators rather than by the masses. If you want to launch a revolution, don’t ask yourself, ‘How many people support my ideas?’ Instead, ask yourself, ‘How many of my supporters are capable of effective collaboration?"    Yuval Harari in "Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow" (Great book btw)
Serious question about short ladder attacks
Fellow autist reporting for duty. So every other day we see now that there are short ladder attacks. One day the stock looks good and doesn’t fall by 10%, the next day the stock crashes into the ground at a crazy rate. Short ladder attacks are illegal so how is the SEC not doing anything about this when it’s clear as day that this is going on?   In my (completely retarded) opinion, short ladder attacks just show that the hedges are scared shittless.  I’m not rich and hold my 3 gme and 30 amc until I’m on the moon and I’ve put my cats through college.   🏻  🏻 and nothing else.
GET LOUD. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS IS MOTIVATIONAL ADVICE.
WE NEED TO BE LOUD. WE NEED TO REMAIN IN THE NEWS CYCLE TO STICK IT TO THE SUITS. I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE QUIET AND STILL HOLDING, GOOD. I NEED YOU TO BE LOUD, TALK ABOUT THIS SITUATION AND SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ALMOST DAILY ON ONLINE PLATFORMS. KEEP THE ENERGY CONSISTENT.     APES. BE CONSISTENT WITH HOLDS AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR VOICES. LETS GO.
Hats off to you, WSB. Keep it up.
When I first heard about Wallstreetbets, I thought it was just some weird stock market shitposting (I mean technically it is but I thought of it on another caliber). But damn I definitely underestimated the power of a few million individuals.      I never knew how much a bunch of Redditors with a bunch of stock can upholster the economy and leave an impact on the titans of Wall Street. The fact that many of you could've just walked away with your millions of dollars before the next squeeze is absolutely one of the biggest prime examples of having the strongest pair of titanium nutsacks being driven into the face of the hedge funds.     I never learned the code of stock markets. All I know is green arrow good red arrow bad but listening into this convo, I might just get into this fight alongside all of you, but what the hell do I know. I've had my doubts but I'm starting to see the light in this long battle of despair and fortune. The fact that we are literally RAKING UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for the sake of profit is absolutely unbelievable. Imagine what we could do in the future? Perhaps make another move and start another revolution in the market?     Either way, this is just a post saying to keep up the good work and HOLD THE FUCKIN LINE, YOU GUYS ARE DOING THE WORK OF EVERY SINGLE GOD GRINDED UP IN A SAUSAGE GRINDER. DIAMOND HANDS FOR LIFE
Where’s the help?? Down 200k on GME, keeps falling

Help me in econ class
Hey people of r/wallstreetbets I have an econ game in class and I’m putting a ton of money into GameStop help me out here please
THIS IS THE TIME 〽️! GME IT'S AT LOW COST SO IT'S THE BEST TIME TO INVEST AND MAKE SOME BANANA WORTH DIGITS! GME-AMC TO THE MOON
IF THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU HOLD/BUY, NOTHING WILL:  "I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB,"   The Dallas Mavericks owner and Shark Tank investor said.   THEY'RE PLAYING WITH THE SCORE, TO SCARE REGULAR PEOPLE TO PANIC SALE, GLADLY WE'RE A BUNCH OF APES AND WE HOLD!
Thank god GME is dropping
I never traded before, im still waiting for my depot to be activated, and i was scared that once it is activated, i wont be able to afford a single stock anymore. Now ill be able to buy 10 or more, cant wait for Wallstreet to pay for my new VR Headset and GPU.    \ \ \ Diamond hands and rocket emojis\ \ \
LET EVERYONE KNOW YOU'RE HERE APES -80% AND NOT FUCKING SELLING
Seriously fuck the HF's. They think this is all about money. It's NOT. IDGAF anymore. I will die with this conviction and with my 16 shares of GME and 240 of AMC so long as it means Johnny Silverspoon loses half of his trust fund. Not financial advice, I just like the stock
Remember this name Adam Aron
That is the CEO of AMC, soon that company will over take amazon apple, and Adam will be the richest man on earth.  Everyone will know the AMC CEO like they know who tim apple, elon musk, and jeff bezos is.  We just got to keep buying and holding AMC and we will be riding it to the moon.  Dont stop believing, we can do this.  Adam Aron will be our savior.
Very serious $GME question as a noob
So let's say the shorts aren't covered and the stock drops to $5 (Watching the price, it just might, JFC). At this point, the hedge funds get to make a profit on their shorts. Let's just say they purchase them all back at once..... Because they are purchasing stocks, the price goes up, right? What would it even raise the price to at that point? Unpopular opinion, I get it (Just trying to weigh options): If the price only goes up to like $15 after all shorts are purchased, it makes sense for me to just get out now @$60. But if the purchasing of the shorts has an actual impact and it goes up to like $100, that's worth me hanging   this even something that can be calculated?  \[edit\] Forgot: Not financial or legal advice     \[edit 2\] WHY DOES IT SHOW 18 COMMENTS BUT I ONLY SEE 2?
I sold...
Yes, I sold my   of a share on Robinhood. Then I bought a full share on Fidelity! Fuck Robinhood. My    are on Fidelity now. Am I an idiot for buying more right now? Probably. Still though, here I am! Let's see what happens.   Also, yes, I know. It's just one share. I'm poor so one share is all I can do. At least it's something and maybe it'll pay off one day.
NEVER SELL
Hey guys, just here to keep motivated. NEVER SELL DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR  Stop looking at your phone. Get off your fucking stock apps. Go for a walk, get some fresh air, hang out with friends JUST STOP LOOKING AND RIDE THIS ROCKET TO THE MOON WHEN IT GOES UP     Also this isn’t financial advise, this is just for your mental health advice.
I hope robinhood suffer. I hope citadel, melvin and citron suffer. Fucking hold. What have you even got to lose at this point
I put my small amount of savings in ~600, + a little more from my paycheck. Nothing to laugh at for me, id saved up a little and it was nice. I can live without it,. Im down to ~200 rn and you know, whats the fucking point of selling? Would you rather give a portion of your money away, or risk it all for the fucking tendies?  We are sparta.  We are retard  We are legion  We are dfv  We are diamond hands
Good broker for south americans?
Title. I want to know what brokers you guys recommend. Currently using eToro but I dont really trust them anymore. Want to hear some advice. TY in advance!    shares at 300 +   at 180 and holding! If price goes down to 50 bucks I'll buy another one cause retard.
Proof?
Is there any proof that AMC or GME or BB or NOK are actually going to go back up? Is there any DD out there that needs to be seen about any of these that is not just "i have a feeling!" I know everyone is so fucking tired of hunches and wants information.
Am I correct in assuming that the short ban has run out? Then this is proof that they're f cking with the stock price.
It's interesting to see how stable yesterday was, and how red today is. But I'm honestly not surprised.
Is it likely that HFs are holding back until just before the release of latest SI data?
According to a lot of people they should not have been able to cover, at least in a legal way. They know that we have no evidence of their current SI. To me it would be logical to postpone buying back until just before this gets released. This way they have a lot of time to bring the price down and to bring people to sell before the big bang.   5@172 🤲
Cautionary tale for new investors to the sub
Hello fellow homunculi,   Long time lurker first time poster. This is a post for the baby apes out there and not for our Kongs who have experienced loss. I have never invested over $100 here and there. With this GME explosion I thought itd be a good idea to throw 3 months rent at it that I had saved up.   2 tips if you do that:  1. Have a month rent saved up at least because you WILL be evicted (oops)  2. Invest only what you’re ok with losing  I didn’t follow either step. The bright side is I learned Im a paper hand bitch, I learned to never YOLO and take calculated risk, and most of all I learned that this sub, even with my bad experience recently, is putting up the good fight.   This is not me telling you to sell if you fan afford not to, this is only a caution to new investors about HOW MUCH you can afford to invest.
Lost everything I made. Back to initial investment
Serious question for those who are in a similar position. If gme keeps going down I now lose money instead of staying   you still hold knowing the top may be long gone  Edit: from 44k back to 15k I'm out yall I'm sorry for being weak. If I lost what I started with I couldn't live with myself knowing I have  others to provide for
AMC was a distraction, and it worked
GME is the only one we should be taking care of, but instead a lot of apes bought other 'meme stock', dividing the effort on gme.   One stock at the time would be so much more powerful to squeez the squozen squoz
Hive-mind retardation
Can everyone please stop spamming GME, BB, NOK, AMC. These stocks have such a little amount of upside and I know people are spamming the tickers because they’re down and are scared. Either sell or diamond hand to the ground, but please shut the fuck up I don’t care about these stocks. I miss when WSB used to have a variety of meme stocks: PLTR, CRSR, AMD and most of all TSLA. This hive-mind spamming of the same irrelevant tickers is going to take WSB to the ground, our power comes from adapting to the market week by week.  Positions:  APHA  HOL   ARKG
Bought 5 shares at   Aint much but its my first time investing
I just bought 3 shares @76
I just bought 3 GME shares at $76, the more it goes down the more we buy at dips.
What did you expect?
The Billionaires will ALWAYS WIN.  I'm still holding, but I'm only in about $250.  Those people whose lives are ruined... I wish there was something we could do.  Either way... don't sell. In honor of those who lost everything - HOLD
Can someone explain what’s next for AMC?
Hi! I’m kinda new to the stock world so I’m a bit confused on what’s happening next. I bought into AMC a while back and from what I saw today was supposed to be the day that the squeeze happens. Obliviously the markets only been opened for a few hours, but I guess I’m just confused since all I’m seeing is decline still. Can someone explain what’s happening right now? Again this is mainly for AMC. I know it had something to do with today being the end of the 4th quarter but that’s about it. Thanks in advance!
We have to be strong in spirit
To all the retards that are panicking,  Do you all realize that the squeeze is inevitable? It might not happen soon but it will happen. The shorts are trying to weather out this storm before they close their positions in the future.  Think about it like this, Gamestop appointed three new members to its management. Ryan Cohen is not fooling around.  Once Gamestop starts publishing good results and steady growth, the shorts have no other option than to close their positions. How are they going to continue shorting a company that keeps performing good? They can’t.  They are literally waiting for us to move on from GME so they can offload their positions in a more calm market at a more affordable price.  This might take weeks, but it’s gonna happen.
Lesson learned to all you bagholders
If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. Learn some fundamentals before you gamble your life savings. Learn to invest some real companies. All you desperate folk can post as many diamonds and rockets as you want, it’s not doing anything. Anybody who is upset about this post is definitely a bag holder who lost a fuck ton of money. Retards quite literally
I'm confident that any whistle blowers would be gofundme compensated.
Congress says they're going have a hearing to discuss all this bullshit. If you can present irrefutable evidence that supports the widely accepted position that retail investors are being fucked deliberately by HFs, SEC, and/or media I recommend you come forward.   The world will compensate you with more than enough to live comfortably, you will be remembered in history as a critical element in revealing corruption and leveling the scales of a rigged system. I'd even wager that many if not most businesses would be willing to comp their products and services to you solely because of the reputation and good will blowing the whistle will generate.   Death or Glory. Fix the system.

Didn't listen, got margin called. Uninstalled the app to avoid losing money
By the time it’s reported, it’ll already be too late.
Listen up, NO ONE can predict the future. You either hold or you fold. But no one is going to signal when the squeeze is coming. By the time they’re talking about it, it will already be happening.  The talking heads on TV aren’t going to come out and say “we are screwed in X days” or “yeah we are about to lose billions” the ONLY time you’ll hear these stories will be AFTER they have lost the billions.  Whether the price goes up or down, the final outcome is always unknown until it happens. So buckle up and enjoy the ride. If you get off now, that’s the END for you. For everyone holding, the future is still uncertain.   Maybe it’s a week, maybe it’s a month, maybe it’s 5 years but that’s what humans do. We go the distance. That’s what EVERYONE is doing. These HF are also holding on until the bitter end until their hand is forced. We might not like it, but they have    too. It’s not over until it’s over and you better believe this isn’t the end of the story for us or them.  Not financial advice, I’m just not going to give up my seat on the

GME STOCKS ARE FULL
i just dont see why
any of you paper handed pussies are selling at a dip when the name of the game was hold your shares and wait??? nobody told you how long it would be, the stock market changes every single day, if they stopped us from buying shares last week when it was sky rocketing and then immediately started artificially driving the price down, WHY WOULDNT YOU expect it to get this low this week?? i just wanna know why you’re so easily willing to let them win
Clover Health Shares Slide After Hindenburg Attacks Business
Maybe this isn’t the best place for you. I recommend checking out r/babystreetbets. Take your pennies and shit posts elsewhere
If you came here to get rich quick, this isn’t the place for you. If you came here to lose everything you own and end up hating the stock market, stick around. We don’t need to see 400,000 posts about “holding the line” or   . Many people who recently joined this sub have lost their ass on some of these “meme stocks”. If you’re new to investing, I recommend leaving this sub Reddit and checking out ones like r/stocks, r/investing, r/babystreetbets. Many of us have been in GME before it even hit $20 and rode that wave all the way up to $400+. As my mom used to say, “you’re a day late and a dollar short”. I never knew what they meant and really still don’t, but it applies here perfectly.   Start off small if you want to win big. I was playing around with less than $2,000 back in September when i went ALL IN ON GME. This isn’t a get rich quick game. If that’s what you thought, I’m sorry for the rude awakening. I joined this sub initially so I could see the MASSIVE losses and learn what NOT to do in order to be successful.   Be smart with your money, there is no 14 day return policy with these stocks.
When weak hand Give UP , HF Buy to save anus . HOLD APES !!
I'm sorry but I had to SELL this morning..

I AM HOLDING! But why is it falling ??
I need some reassurance I just lost 8k
Too the Moon Alice!
Am I doing this right?  🤲
As I’m typing this, GME is at   and AMC is at   If you are a real one, hold. I’ve lost so much money now that selling won’t do me any good. HOLD
I don’t have much money to spare. My wife stays at home with our two boys and I work and am only source of income. I have been budgeting for something I’ve wanted for sometime now but thought this was more important. I might be a retard but at least we can all be retards together.
You wanted lossporn, Well here it is. 23Y/O Life Savings evaporated. HODLIN UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FORCE SELL THESE SHARES OUT OF MY DEAD BODY'S SKELETON HANDS. (And I'll be holding till I'm 50 turning these shares into a fucking historical relic) gg
I WONT GIVE UP! THIS IS HISTORICAL THEY PROBABLY THINK WE DONT CARE ANYMORE THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO BUY BUY BUY      IM STILL HOLDING TOO

Listen up you smooth brained chimps .. GME has fucked you so hard you're still in the denial stage   Discuss.
New to day trading! Essential reading recommendations
Hello! I'm new to investing in the stock market and I was wondering what magazines and news sources you'd recommend to a novice investor. I currently read The Economist and the Financial Times. If it helps, I'm located in the UK.   Thank you so much in advance! 😊
It’s the principle of the thing..
Im 61 and don’t have much money, but I bought my first stocks today - one share each of GME and AMC.  I didn’t do it to try to make money. I did it because my mama didn’t raise no bitch.
Remember what Mark Cuban said
He said to hold and that if it dropped to keep holding and to buy more.
Which one of you beautiful retards still has their sell limits set at 6,000?
AMC GME is still the new TESLA
how many of you missed the tsla spike in the last year? well this is your chance to invest into the new tsla. these stocks are at a bargain right now, there is potential for these companies to over take tsla / apple / amazon and whatever.  you are in a good position to buy these at a discount and watch your returns skyrocket.

How is everyones Diamond hands now?
Must hurt knowing you pissed away thousands because of a subreddit and a hype bandwagon. Hope you all sell and take what you can before the rocket crashes down to earth.
Dont look at your portfolio or the GME chart
Go do something productive and stop looking at the red chart. Everything will probably be fine (im no financial advisor). They cant hurt you if you dont constantly look at your losses or the price of GME. I mean they are trying with vibrating your phone but dont torture yourself looking at the the price. You are invincible if they cant reach you.
Holding.
I had hopes of changing the system, but they handcuffed us and carried on to play their own game. And the SEC is targeting us. And the stock price is crashing.   Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be here, with DIAMOND HANDS and diamond tears. Good luck to us all. May we win in the end, whenever that may be.
Cheaper than an Econ course (riding to the bottom   🤚)
New to WSB alongside most of the BANG gang or whatever. Been a hell of a ride. Threw in some cash I could afford to lose, definitely lost (missed the $483 while I was at work, and didn’t wanna panic too early ((fml FOMO)))  Learned more from all the back and forth on here than I did spending more money on tuition in a college Econ class a few years back.   Regardless of what happens, still in the red, still in a number I can write off as a loss next tax season (if I sell) and still planning to stick around and gamble with the greats.   Position:   shares/$311 avg  See you retards on the moon, whenever or whatever way we make it there
This pain we feel right now. We must use it to make us stronger. HOLD THE LINE BOYS HOLD.
Hey RH, don't forget my Tax Documents.
After you're done getting scolded by your parents for letting the dog run in the house, go back to your room and finish your US Taxes book report.  I need to comply with my citizenship.  It's also interesting that they finished the scolding with upping your allowance.  Mom and Dad are still gonna be upset for a few weeks and they won't clarify if it's about you.  But something is still wrong, that's for sure.
In need of actual advice
I invested in GME at 390$ for 2 shares. Dont get me wrong I understand its not much at all compared to some people in this fight. I will hold!!! But I am in a serious loss.  Is there even a chance of it skyrocketing again? Or at least going up some bit? Can we win? Is there a factual strategy? Or are we all being laughed at as we lose?
New recruit in the army
I read someone posted about the second wave and I believe thats true. I couldn’t get into it for the first time but the dip is definitely chance for all the new retard armies like me to contribute to this war.  So I urge people like me who missed the first time to contribute to this cause.  PS: I currently have 13 GME’s and I am holding it like a mother holds her child.
Do not FALTER GME is for big nut APES
Expert anal-ist expect the price of gay stock to go down to $40, DO NOT BE AFRAID as this is the valley it is expected to hit. Stay hopeful for the companies future  This is advice from an expert anal-ist, but what do I know, I’m not a financial advisor, just an asshole advisor
These last two days have let me go from 2 to 15 shares!!!!
Why is everything happening the opposite of what we were told

GME Round 3 DD
Alright boys listen up. I know this is going to be hard to hear, but there is a cabal of satan worshiping stock brokers who are MANIPULATING the price by performing short ladder rituals to extract adrenechrome from our tendies. TRUST THE PLAN
No, I will not sell. Loss porn posted I doubled down to lower my cb. Monkey hold till 0
not much, but holding for the boys
Just a reminder. We are here🤲
GME could be at 5$ and people would still think its just the did here
Just saying  \ dip\
I feel like it's going to pay off. It will all work out.... Maybe
About once a year it seems there is always a big pullback. It's been a year since last Feb and everything lost like ~30%.  Insiders have been selling the past year, funds are holding more cash, volume is going down overall.  I think GME/AMC/BB will force a bunch more funds to liquidate causing a huge sell off at large.  Remember to buy the dip though!  Hold and we win! I don't do emojis ever, so imagine some diamonds and hands.
Get Revenge on RobinHood by Switching to Sofi
I know a lot of people are pissed at robinhood and you should probably switch trading platforms, yes you can switch to fidelity or others , but consider SoFi because they are probably the biggest threat to RobinHood as Sofi is targeting retail investors, zero commission fees, good UI.      Just a thought autists an enemy of my enemy is my friend.
GME to the Moon!!!
With my 1 share I am going to hold till $10,000! Keep buying this dip!!!!  No financial advice I just love this stock.

We’re at the point right now where we’re finding out who are the weak    I’m seeing so many people jump ship because “boohoo I lost money today”. Nut up and hold pansies!

Lurking this sub for a while, and it's absolutely disgusting to see how many serviette-handed morons panic-storming and spamming among the bots. Seriously normies, gtfo and don't come here, you joined the hype a ruined the hype with your weak-ass mentality. Stay away if you can't hold the line. A CHAIN IS A STRONG AS ITS WEAKEST LINK . DONT DILUTE THE SUB! STFU AND GTFO NORMIES

Keep holding!
Even if you’ve lost faith in GME you should hold, if you don’t sell you won’t have a realized loss.
In at $300, I’m not fucking leaving
AMC TO THE MOON
I know everyone feeling pretty down about GME but If you still wanna help the cause and you dont got big olr buckaroos to be spending. AMC IS THE WAY FELLOW MONKES ITS CHEAP AND WE STILL WAITING TO BE SQOUZED!
I figured out how to get rid of my GME losses on paper.
Woke up this morning and my GME was down 25%. I reduced my losses by buying more GME. Now only down 15%. Might buy some more tomorrow if I see more losses.      Investing is easy.
Not the loss porn we deserve, but the loss porn we need right now
I got faith in all us     APES WE LIKE THE STOCK    🌕
‼‼GME is decreasing because WE want‼‼‼
It is falling because people is getting scared. But there is still hope. There are not sellers, only an enemy selling to himself.     If you can´t see your portfolio falling, simply, close your eyes. Go and do others things, and forget you have GME actions.     You´ll earn money without knowing. But DON´T SELL.
Ape toGUHther strong
Holding GME @145 since 25 January (w/ other meme stocks). Could've cashed in £6k profit at least twice. Saw £3k losses on my monitor twice. Still holding. CLENCH YOUR ASSES & HOLD. It's just psychological & you can distract yourself until the squeeze happens. IT'S NOT A LOSS UNTIL YOU SELL.

One more day fam 😭😭.
Dear Fellow Retards,
Dear Fellow Retards,   We have lost the war. Come join me on the other side. $BA $DIS and Airlines
Plan B: Hold until end of Feb, then loss to carry forward.
I am in GME at an avg of $150. The next big date appears to be Feb 9.  Depending on consensus analysis and the apes in the room, I am going to exit end of Feb and then come back 30 days later.   I like the stock, so I can take the loss for tax purposes (see USA rules on wash sales). There is risk of       preventing a buy back, which is why I wait.  I am not a financial adviser, and am going to take the loss against profits (selling positions) so I can buy more green potential.  Holding for now, I like the stock and my fellow smooth brains.
What in the actual fuck why the dip
Everyday that I cost a Hedge Funds millions/billion is win for me.
I don’t give a fuck how much I lose I’m holding till I can pass this stock to my grandkids so they know the tail.  Diamond  Brain!!  This is not financial advice you retard. This is tard to tard understanding.
GME and ACM to the Moon, apparently...
Hello fellow idiots, I guess in the End we really are just a bunch of retards. The war is over, and my Money went to Atlantis. Hahahahaha. Don’t worry I‘m still holding this bullcrap, but that was it. See you at 5 bucks per Stock. OH YEAHHH     💰
Fellow retards, need some advice regarding a margin situation I'm in.
Long story short (and I'm guessing I'm not the only one in such a situation):  Bought 2 GME @ 120 and bought the 3rd GME on margin at 105.  Obviously, being a smooth brained retard, I didn't fully understand what margin trading is.  Anyway, I'm about to have my stock @ 105 auto-sold due to the low price (I think if GME hits 50)  Should I sell it to keep the other 2 alive or should I let it just stay and hope stock goes up? (am too poor to fund more).

To everyone who's worrying
Hey guys. I know you're stressed about losing money. We all are. Just know that there's clear evidence of short ladder attacks/ ladder attacks going on for gme & amc. I know the large loss looks bad right now, but hold strong. If you sell now you have lost, if you hold you haven't really lost anything.
Just bought 4 more🤲  🌒💪🏽
Let's goooooooo. Or we all lose, or we all win.🏆 #gme
Bought @ $200, and I'm deep in the red. It doesn't matter, because not only do I like the stock, but I like the community.
This is my first time posting here, and I've been having some real FUD seeing GME go to $60 and below. Not like I'd paper hand because why would I? No point in selling at this low of low.  What I would like to say, however, is that seeing others in the same position is comforting. All the people still holding while in the red and still    is honestly comforting. I didn't think I'd be happy losing money...  I could've bought new PC parts, invested that money to safer options, or literally just not spend it on such a huge bet. But instead I bought it hoping for the short squeeze. Will it come? I don't know. Did it already happen at $400? Probably. But lurking in this sub for a while, I knew that what I spent my money on was more than just to profit, but to show those hedge fund billionaires what a community can do. We sure did stress those guys out of their comfy high-chairs, huh?  I find peace knowing that a lot of us are holding till the end, and that I'm not alone in being in the deep red. I like the stock, and so do others, therefore I will hold till the end.  Thanks, WSB! \ Community really is something else.\
Don't let paper hands convince you this is over. I LIKE THIS STOCK
I wanted to post my loss porn. I’ll probably skip trading for a few months. But I will keep my bag forever.
This sub is amazing.
Been lurking here for a long time, always been a fan of the memes. This last two weeks has been the most entertaining time of this sub.  I absolutely loved watching the 8 million noobs get pump and dumped like a $3 crack whore. Seeing people down 80% wondering when the squeeze is happening, complaining about "short ladder attacks" (props to whoever made that one up) all of it, absolutely magnificent.  To all the people who believed in the diamond hands meme... You got fucking wrecked by mediocre traders who psi-op'd you into not selling so they can make a clean exit. Your anus was thoroughly destroyed and you cheered it on the whole time.  This was possibly the greatest pump and dump of all time.    I didn't buy any meme stocks... I'm too busy actually making money.
Why I Hold
Let me start this off with a disclaimer that this is by no means any financial advice, I am not a financial advisor and enjoy eating the blue flavored crayons.   So why do I invest in these meme stocks? Because it gives me   hope  . Hope that I kept losing day by day. Some of you have never had to worry about eating less calories to save money on rent. Some of you never had to worry about not being able to afford the last year of university and losing your future. I’m sure some of you can relate, whether you went through the same events as me or not. I can go on about the struggles in my life but that is aside the point. The only things that have pushed me throughout all the harsh life were my dreams of a better future for my own family one day. WSB has become a new home that showed me the vast amount of knowledge I can learn to invest   smarter  . There is so much DD among the countless memes that you can pick apart and learn from. Here’s something I learned,  ”You can only lose when you sell.” My dumbass from the start put in $ never expecting to see it back. That’s why seeing all this red doesn’t shake me. This whole movement, other than my dreams, is the only other catalyst in my life to live to a happier, healthier tomorrow. I’m not fucking selling. This is my home after GME and AMC and   WE’RE NOT FUCKING LEAVING!!!     My autistic ass has never found another home so open to people making ridiculous financial decisions off of a mix of part DD and part meme. I have never found another home so entertaining, yet insightful at the same time. I have never seen the glory of being a  ”winner”.  And you know what, I’m not leaving till I see that day. I’m not leaving till we take it to the moon again. I’m not leaving till we take it to the stars. I’m not leaving till everyone knows we can take it this far. We’re supercharged and we’re going to take this thing to Mars.   ALEXA   PLAY “Lift Off” BY KANYE WEST  TLDR: Hadn’t been for this whole meme stock blowing up, I would have never found such an amazing community that offers so much knowledge to take in. Hadn’t been for this whole meme stock, I would have slowly let my dreams slipped away. With this meme, I remember dream. I remember goal, I find soul. Friend call me buffoon, BUT I REPLY MOON SOON!    DIAMOND HANDS OR DIE BY OWN HANDS TRYING                (     ,      .)

You can’t convince me a company GOING OUT OF BUSINESS who’s Stock went viral rocketed, then crashed AFTER going viral, will be a good investment to HOLD.
Convince me why you shouldn’t sell of now because the price will once again moon. 🐸 🍵   DiAmOnD mUnKeY hAnDz! u pApEr hAnDz wEAk! 🐵   💪 Is not a compelling argument either.

Everything is dropping right now
This is a second time posting as it seems the mention of the 'C' word gets the post removed.  Digital currency \['cos mentioning their category is verboten here\], metals, shares...  Something is going on but I have no idea what.  Panic if you need to or don't...   I'm not but this is not financial advice.  The only financial advice I'll give is never play with money you're not prepared to lose.
Let's talk about some long game
1: Game Stop is already putting the Cohen e-commerce magic to work. You can already purchase fully built PCs, peripherals, your über cool 'gaming' chairs, and it's more than likely going to keep going. I am actually stoopid so, dont take my word for it, go visit the website to see for yourself (not a promotion, just do your DD at will) A1: GameStop is an almost household name and has been for a for a while until they fell behind the curve and  didn't keep up with their customers wants, and adapt to online retail. A2: Cohen..... Papi bring tendies.  2: AMC, the place that has that diabetes inducing butter that you aren't quite sure is butter but you still slather it on your popcorn anyways because it's good. As states ease covid restrictions, and people feel they are safe to start going back out again, revenue will keep going up and where else would you rather watch John Wick 4? Movie theaters, the beacon of normalfuckingceee.
Dumb question
I just bought the GME dip
It’s so nice to discount it to 65 today
i just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart, FUCK YOU MELVIN. AND FUCK THE SYSTEM. you can have my shares over my dead diamond encrusted nuts.
DONT UNDERESTIMATE APES!!! HODDDDLLLLLL
I had a dream, no this isn't made up
Last night I dream there's a huge ape chilling in my yard. I think hm and go about my business. (Dreams don't make sense OK?) I check later, he's gone. A bit later there's 2. I realize this is weird but they're just chilling. They come and go, not sure how many times.   Then one is in my backyard and this is where I kind of freak out because my pets have a dog door and I don't want them hurt. THEN IT STARTS TALKING. "Hey is that a cat? Can I see?" and starts coming for my back door. I'm frantically trying to keep my animals inside and lock the door because a talking ape is cool and all but I don't know if he eats cats. And sliding doors are IMPOSSIBLE to lock. Stupid little thing you're supposed to slide but it jams and doesn't line up right and he's getting closer.   So I wake up, heart racing trying to catch my breath and it takes about 2 seconds to make the connection of why I'd dream about apes in the first place and then I'm laying in bed laughing my head off at 3am.  So you apes are cool and all but don't eat my fucking cats.
Anyone a fan of "Deadwood"?
Ellsworth:   "I'm late, Ma'am, over shooin' a man away from your diggin's named Frances Wolcott, that scouts for George Hearst, who wouldn't spare attention for a   or the sun itself if he didn't think it likely to fill his coffers. Nor the sort'd shrink from a lie, or more than one, to advance his purpose, or be ignorant or of how to circulate his falsehoods without anyone knowin' their source. And now I come to   to hear the waters called muddy and the current quickened, though I see no change in the creek. And the "Hooples," certain sure that flood crest fast approaches, have begun to think keenly, "I'll get ahead of the event. Maybe I'll sell my claim at discount." Anything to unharness so they can head for the higher ground. Myself, Ma'am, I'd be bettin' that the levy'll hold."
Still holding in Chicago
What was r/wallstreetbets like before GME?
Just wondering. Hadn’t heard of this sub before GME hit the news. I did not get into GameStop, but have decided to start investing on my own in other stocks. I’m just wondering what this place was like before all the GME  ’s neigh impossible to find much of anything here that isn’t about AMC/GME currently. After the insanity passes, what will this place be like. Is there value here?
Trust your fellow retards here to hold
Title says it all.

$GME is down in the $65 range. It's like a steam sale! And just like steam you can buy and then forget you have it. This is not financial advice, I'm just a retard and I like the stock.

An unpopular opinion
Good morning degenerates.  I just wanted to say that I LOVE this sub. I was in the original   million before it skyrocketed to 8 million in a matter of weeks.  This sub is not the same as it once was. I’m seeing loss porn of $10 and I’m sitting here scratching my head. I get it.. that could’ve been a meal at your local Wendy’s, but damn man.. let’s limit these posts.  Don’t get me wrong, I love me some good loss porn... I also love some good DD on other companies, but it is flooded with GME and AMC.   We’re all fucking down on the stonks. I like the stonk and I am currently down quite a bit.. but I’m NOT selling. Neither should you...    Buy the dip if you believe. I have. Then it keeps dipping. But these stonks will be going to my children and my children’s children.  They will be a part of history. We are all a part of history. Just HOLD and stop crying over your micro losses. Don’t use money you can’t afford to lose.  Let’s make WSB again.   Positions: 600 AMC, 15 GME, 250 BB all bought at the top.       pleas fly again.
Crazy influx of "GME Bad" everytime the market is open, ain't it?
If these people were actual paperhands, they'd post loss porn. They'd lament their loss in a thread or two. They'd tell you how much they lost and post proof.     But instead they open shill thread after shill thread. They go into every comment section to tell us the suits won. They're trying to demoralise those that have potential paper hands.     Why isn't this happening in the middle of the night? Because in the middle of the night, they can't make people sell stock in a panic attack.        Literal primate, officially disagnosed as autistic, I don't know shit about finances.     8@170
It’s not much but I’m still holding
If I follow my stock strategy on I followed on Neopets will I win the stock market?
So, on Neopets the stock market is random. You pretty much buy the cheapest stock you can afford that day, and then wait for it to double or triple or whatever in value until you sell it. Your portfolio ends up in the red all the time, but you just hold your stocks til they rise. Then you make your profits, hopefully before they fall again.  If I follow this on the actual stock market, not really caring what I buy but just buying whatever seems to be in a dip, investing about $100 weekly, and then holding onto them for a while hoping the price will eventually increase, will I make money?  This is kind of a real question because this is the only stock strategy I have experience with.
Sell orders above $10k at the 30-30th row of the GME order book?!

Invested at $217, still holding tho.

Thank you!
Just want to make this appreciation post to the hedge fund managers that decided to try and dip the price by laddering what little shares they currently have. Perfect time to bring down my average cost/share and buy more.    So THANK YOU! That is all. :)
They’re getting inside your head
They’re trying to breakdown this subreddit and make the apes disband. They’re throwing everything they have at it, but apes together strong, hold the fucking line.  This is not financial advice.
I’m a broke ass student but I’m holding, all we need is all of us here to hold and we win!
Who else has bought GME every day this week?
What is the current short position? (GME)
See title. Looking for reliable, updated info on how much of the short position has been covered.  Anyone know?
AMC SHORT LADDER ATTACK!! THERES STILL MORE PEOPLE BUYING THEN SELLING!!
GME pulled out at 408 squeeze happened😹
staying stRong and still buying shaRes.
neveR fucking suRRendeR.  everybody harambe till we hit the moon.  me no financial advisoR, me just stay stRong, be own ape... make good bad decision on self.
Is this blatant revenge on Chamath Palihapitiya??? Looks like it.
Even this pilot gets it
Short reports come out every 2 weeks. This is what we did, you beautiful retards. It cost the hedgies a LOT of money and they moved to cover as fast as they could. AND THIS WAS WHEN IT WAS AT $40. Whether you held or sold, at least we did this. The next report comes out soon.
Big sharks win haha
Btw when they got done hyping this GME shit up, shit already hit the fan and it was too late. The big sharks got their bag from $20 to $500, and left to dump what they and media pumped. yall bagholders lost.   All this diamond hand ape and GME to $1000 is all cope.  Cope cope cope. Keep coping buddy boyos
its not a lot, but UK spastic here!
Emotional involvement has never been this high, please understand what game they are playing.
Let me go through a little bit of what took place:  When the hedge funds were cornered and the squeeze was triggered (on both Thursday and the following Tuesday) all retail investors were blocked from buying GME and could only sell. This will inevitably create a crash in price. The moment the price crashed they lifted the limitations. It was black and white what they were doing.  On top of this, right as this event was in full swing a wide range of articles and new channels started promoting how social media has moved on from GME to focus on SLV (Really!??)... nobody was focusing on silver. The price of silver was driven up buy the hedge funds pre market and immediately started declining again while the news continued to emphasis the end of the GME squeeze (which wasnt over, it was blocked from happening) all the while dribbling on about the SLV craze (that didnt exist). Coincidentally the hedge funds involved in the GME situation also happen to profit highly from the SLV hype that was created.  And last but not least, there was (and still is) clear evidence that hedge funds have been continuously trading GME back and forth all week at lower and lower prices to artificially drive down the price and cause retail investors to lose interest in GME (  essentially give up).  What’s happening now is theft in broad day light. The hedge funds are acting like the spoiled kid at a park who takes his ball and leaves because hes losing at the game. The moment it wasnt working for the hedge funds the illusion of free market was popped.  Reality is that we retail investors get screwed every day by front running, shorting and HFT. That is the bigger theft. This is just a more visible theft, because Wall St. nearly failed.  Also, they still might fail. I'm still buying GME with my money.  If I lose it, I lose it. But I can buy more shares at this price and I still don't think the shorts covered.
Why would it be over you fucking morons?
If it was over they wouldn't be fighting it so hard. If we lost, what is left to fight?  Stop being a paper handed little bitch and hold. You don't lose money till you sell. You realize they have to buy back all the inventory right? As soon as they start buying the price has to go up. When you're buying in that high of a volume you can't keep the price low. So if you're selling you're screwing yourself over.  Oh, and to the people saying they lost this months rent or they lost money they would use for their livelihood, you're an idiot. This IS a gamble.  Not was a gamble, because it's still going retards.  Hold for dear life, maybe even log off the internet for today. Do what you gotta do, but just know nobody would be selling this low. You don't lose money till you sell.
The Pros and Cons.
There are Pros and Cons to this so everyone needs to stand back and remember this. GME has the potential to hit the Pros we wanted. Its still there and Ill show you why. Im no financial expert but the game is always going to change.   PROS:  \-Gamestop has a new board,   \-Gamestop isnt going bankrupt.  \-Gamestop has made a deal with microsoft on digital sales  \-The people on the board of gamestop are part of a successful company!  \-Its low now, but things are probably going to change by a standard especially with gamestop going into new directions as a buisness.  \-Theres no expiry date  The Cons  \- You sell, you will lose the money you put into it.  \-The stock wont hit the value you hoped it would hit  The Pros here: Hedge funds counted on gme to go out of business but its not, its still in buisness. Im holding because I believe in the community even if people are being toxic, this is my first stock I think Personally right now holding is the best move on the table right this moment. and as it gets low buy up some more. Because as it stand gme has a lot to gain for the unexpected turn of events its facing. With a new board of people and people who have held success as well.
Just bought 30 AMC and I believe!
Europe is with you
Thanks Mint!
FYI, y’all are not hero’s for buying and holding. GameStop employees see y’all as insensitive and out of touch with reality
You guys started selling tees to buy more GME?
I know shorts don't expire but what would happen if we all tried to move our position away from where they are right now?
I don't know enough about how the Market/Clearings operate so this might be a ultra-retarted type of question but, wouldn't asking to move my position to a different place require it to be "consolidated" therefore requiring these positions to be "closed" and in case they were borrowed, they'd have to be returned?  Please ELI5 if that's not the case!
is over, 💩  is coming
obligatory I just like the stock, not financial advice   TLDR- new here, and I just posted that I sold my meme stonks for a loss but I was happy about it in the GME megathread and got instantly downvoted out. Lmfao, mind = opened, everyone is just salty they overspent and were/are too scared to get out, so they are trying to swing the odds back but the masses are already against them, the meme stocks prices are bound to plummet imho  The 💩  are gonna be mad when the meme stocks keep crashing, just cause they are overly hopeful for gigantic returns on a stock that was overpaid for cause it was sensationalized and peaking. Fully knowing it was a gamble w/ odds not in my favor it, I was okay if I lost it all or most, so I put ~$400 into the 2 main meme stocks yesterday. I got questioned by several friends, making me feel kinda dumb tbh, and after watching the less truly autist members discuss what was happening overall with the community here (and the market in general) I decided that all the paper hands are 100% right for what they did, and my main message on the GME thread was that I'm HAPPY TO HAVE ENTERED ON MEME STOCKS, EVEN THO I LOST SOME MONEY, BECAUSE I HAD THE WHEREWITHALL TO DROP THE FUCK OUT, SO I CAN EARN REAL MONEY WITH THE REMAINING ~$370. IT ALSO TAUGHT ME THAT IN THE STOCK MARKET, NOT EVEN YOU NEIGHBOR GIVES A FLYING FUCK ABOUT YOU, YOURE EITHER THE CHUM OR THE SHARK.  Edits Since some of you aren't getting this... THIS ENDEAVOR WAS NOT A REAL INVESTMENT ATTEMPT. I knew this was a shot in the dark stock going into it. I knew I could lose it ALL potentially in an hour. The haters saying I emotionally decided on the buy/sell like they are revealing something new is unnecessary, I know and I knew it beforehand. Maybe I didn't state it well enough.... TO ME, THIS WAS A GAMBLE ON PURPOSE, LIKE PUTTING $400 ON A HAND OF POKER. I was playing this specific bet, and this bet alone, on the OFF CHANCE it took off based on the talk I was seeing and hearing throughout the day, but the mood of the social aspect of the economy, to me, seemed like it was a done deal, so I folded.   My entire point SIMPlified: I started a gamble, I saw it was a likely losing hand and folded before I lost any more. Allowing myself to put this money that, at first I was willing to lose, into a more secure gain. Thus, the GME post-peak hype is lame, but it got me into the market, cause this was some of my extra money anyway so I'm happy  OK I'm done and I'm going snowboarding see y'all later
PETITION TO REMOVE THE 8 MILLION NORMIES AND START OVER WITH THE ORIGINAL
The WSB we knew is gone. The funny memes, the DD posts, the loss porn, the general retardation is gone. Now it's just a bunch of people asking how to make basic trades or why they can't sell their shares on the weekend.   GET EM OUTTA HERE
Paper Hands, Stonks, $GME, Diamond hands, Apes, Stupid, Retard. I like the STock
This isn't financial advice, I make myself poor rich ape diamond hands don't sell. Am I WSB now? This sub is sooooo not cool like it used to be.
Guess what am I doing right now ?
I'm buying more GME
Please think for yourself.
I think it is time for me to post something. Everywhere I look there people grasping around for good news and/or conspiracies. I know its hard to see your portfolio drop like this for the first time. This can cause emotional trading and that’s been proven to never be beneficial. I think its important to take a step back from it all and paint the bigger picture for yourself. Not every bullish theory is true and not every bearish theory is true. Try to distinguish fact from fiction for yourself. The points below are just tips that I think might help you.  1. We don’t know until the 9th of february if the shorts have been closed.   The original reason that this stock gained so much popularity was the short interest. As far as we know nothing has changed yet on this part. Even if it has, there is nothing we can do about it but hold and/or buy more. We know for sure that the short float number of 140% was right due to the massive report losses for melvin and the reports. So as long as no 100% factual news is released on short interest. We should just wait.  2. If you believe in GME keep the hype going  As long as there is hype around gme there is a chance for a breakout. If you are stressing about your positions, get engaged in conversation. Try to think about why you decided to buy in the first place. Weigh pros and cons of other people arguments. But don’t get carried away solely by gme bulls or gme bears. The more people talk about this stock the higher the chance that this is your Willy Wonka ticket to tendie town.  3. Stop looking at your screen 24/7. You are only working yourself up.  It is best to just set alerts for price and notifications for reddit posts if you really want to. Looking at the price every minute is not going to change it. Thinking about gamestop every minute can really swing your opinion in the extremities. By this I mean that you will only believe news from one side of the spectrum. The more you look, the more you stress, the harder it is to think rationally.  4. Making a list with the news around the stock can help.  The news on gamestop has been changing a lot each day. There are many negative and positive posts each with their own arguments. Try not to get carried away by a day with mostly negative or positive news. Rather make a list of all the news so you have an overview. This way you can take a step back from the current opinion.   Personal opinion: I think that as long as the short interest has staid high there is a chance for another breakout. In my opinion Melvin capital (and other shorters) will try their best to make back their losses. And the only way to do that is by shorting GameStop. All we need to do is keep the hype going. Talk about the stock, repeat your bullish thesis and keep believing.  I know its scary to rely on other people not selling their stock. I think its best to compare it to selling your 10$ lottery ticket for 5$ before the results have been drawn. The only differences is that we actually have a chance of winning. The fact that this has gotten so much more media attention than “normal pumps” should also be reassuring.   ps. this is not financial advice. I am just a regular investor who saw the short float and wanted to try his luck.   I own 27 shares of gamestop at $230. Will buy more if it keeps dropping. Wish the best of luck to you all in the stock market. Trading should be fun.
The Bottom
I have an ape brain, but I've been plotting graphs with sticks and bananas. I'm pretty sure we hit the bottom around 61. I could be wrong, but I pooped in my
Daddy chamath just posted this
Is it wrong I'm losing hope?
I am holding but I bought GME at $340 and it looks like I'm never getting that money back. Everyone is telling me it's not gonna go back up, and I'm just fucking losing hope.
Sunken Cost Fallacy
Just becauss you lost X amount doesn't mean you can't lose more.  If you genuinely believe in gme or any other stock then sure, stay in long term. But "I lost $$$ already" isn't a valid investing strategy when you consider that stocks can drop to a fraction of their current price.
Pathetic!
I’m not crying I’m holding diamond hands  🏾
They really wanna try us?
Finally cheap enough for this broke student to jump on the train!
LOST ABOUT 5K when I initially SOLD. But bought more in hopes of salvaging my own dignity. STILL HOLDING
We just gotta make it to Monday.
Seriously if you're gonna sell do it on Monday. Everyone was all    while the chart was green, but now that it's red I hear a lot of 📃 . Like wait until we know what the short interest is and go from there, by selling now all your doing is locking in a loss. What if we find out short interest is still sky fucking high on Monday?
I've reached a point where the share is so low that even selling it is more embarrassing.
If the boat is sinking, I'm staying with it!
Bought another 41 shares.       🛰🛰🛰🛰🛸 let's get weird. Marked it as a gain because of my diamond hands I'm holding them with.
Dirty Melvin ladder attacks
So today when I was walking past the closed Gamestop store a ladder from a worker that was putting 'FOR SALE' sign on the store fell on me. Amazing what kind of ladder attacks these Melvin hedgies are pulling on us.
Come on you fucking retards, give me the loss porn
Half the reason I've come here for years is the loss porn. GME was bound to come down some, and now that it has, I better believe some of you are redder than a stray dog's cock.  I still believe in the resurgence, but for now, give me the fucking loss porn damnit. That's our thing.  GME back to the moon   .
I’m a retard and bought my GME & AMC shares through Stash.
I wasn’t aware that they only allow trading in 4 windows each day want more control than that. My question is; should I hold there or transfer to a proper brokerage site, and if so when?
Can someone help me understand some of these guys' panic posts?
Let me explain. I know jack shit about finance, I'm too lazy to dig in despite pretending to understand everyone's DD after recently joining. But I'm gonna ask someone to point out the fallacy in this non-finance argument:  Before wsb ballooned to 7 million+,   it was wsb that pretty much single-handedly took on wall street  . I know for damn sure that these wsb OGs are still holding it down with diamond hands. The OGs are only adding to their portfolios, why do the other pussies who came and went like my wife's boyfriend make any difference? This is a serious question.  I see red every day but honestly with the little money I have, if at worst my investment says fuck you to HFs, then I'm good, I'm gonna keep holding my shares of fuck you. Making money would be nice, losing money for the hedgies is almost better for a sick sadistic fuck such as myself.  But the only thing that would make me actually get nervous is if the original apes are getting scared and selling, and I   really   don't think that's happening.     So is there an actual reason pussies are posting this shit?
Friends, I am now officially a retard.
My analysis on GME as of today
Hi everyone  I’ll try to keep this as short as possible as I know that most of you have the attention span of a clownfish.   First of all this isn’t financial advice and should not been taken as such this is only my personal view on the matter and could be completely erroneous.   For all the new people this is post as discussion and not DD because this isn’t due diligence I feel like it needs to be said when we can see the amount of rubbish spammed DD to say nothing but “Diamond hand” or “it’s not over” without giving any information of sorts.  I’ve been a lurker of this sub since I’ve created this Reddit account so more or less a year now. I’ve never got much involved on conversation or other as I didn’t feel like what I had to say would be relevant. I have had my play without giving echoes of it following some DD seen here and crossed with my own research. I’ve joined GME like probably most of this Sub when it went above $20. I’m still holding tho and that’s what brings me here today.   Some of the squeeze might have happened on the 28th when priced went to an all time high of $483. That undeniable. Yes it has been driven by a hype and FOMO worldwide but the amount of short was in my opinion too high to trigger only this much (again with the data given at the time). Drive went down drastically but went back up again over $300 might have been some covering from shorts but again no new enough data to support this fully.   So yes lots of people probably sold and yes HF might have covered but according to last days it seems that they are pushing hard to drive the price down. The next available data for shorts will only be available on 9th Feb and it probably give them enough time to drive the price further down and shake as many paper hands of too cover at the price they need.   Think about it this way Yesterday GameStop had a huge announcement with recruiting people that used to work for the biggest e-commerce firm and price barely soared 2%. Yes in normal time when a stock isn’t on everyone watch because it’s not short that much announcement like this for any company would drive the price like this but for the most watched company of all times with the biggest short interest. That seems odd. And my opinion is that they tried the hardest to keep the price down all day and carry on today with lots of paper hands shaking.   My personal belief is that undeniably lots of people sold and who could blame them ? Yes having diamonds hands is great but it doesn’t do it all. I myself put what I could “afford” to lose at first buying 31 shares for more or less $1200 got 10 at $35 another 10 at $41 and 11 at $37.  I’ve sold them some around peak to cover my initial investment and took some profit to double down on an eventual dip which bring me again to the same amount of 31 shares holding today with saving my initial investment (I got to think of my family first and cannot really afford to loose this amount. Now what’s in my play is money I can loose as it is only unrealised gains.   One last thing do not blame people for becoming paper hands it’s a tough game and it’s being played against the toughest people of WallStreet. These people or used to never loose and they will do whatever it takes to fuck everyone to get out of this keeping their reputation for customers and most of their money.   Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.  TLDR : Some short been squoze but most mine remain in and they are gonna carry on driving price down trying to cover if enough paper hands until report for 31Jan come out on 9th Feb.   Edit for TLDR.
450 shares at $350. I’m holding
This is for what they did in 2008.   This is about crippling them where it hurts most.   They will play their dirty tactics, play with our morale.   Hold strong with me fellow retards. We are going to the moon
GME and AMC. Welcome to the stock market.
I've been trading since 2011 and guess what. This shit just happens. And it can go on for years. it's literally just money and it always eventually comes back. These stocks are just as retarded as us. But they have wild mood swings. Fear not. It always comes back around.   Don't be dumb and sell at a loss. Just chill out and wait.   I got into Blackberry around 2012? And it was on the up after a big fall. It then went down to a point where I was losing money. I held. Bought more and held. Made some money all the way back up to around 15 in 2018 and took a good profit.  I sold half and left 130 shares in it.   I had to wait until 2021! To see 15 again. And I sold at 16. It felt good to be free of it. But it kept on climbing and I lost out on the recent peak.  Basically don't be a loser and sell. Just man up and ride it out. It's only been a few days of this shit. Try waiting months or years.  Good luck and just relax. It ain't over. It's never fucking over
They’ll have to pry my shares from my cold dead hands. #GME
Finally got my brokerage account approved: Loading up on $GME today
It's taken weeks to get approved, and now I'm buying as much $GME as I can... for my grandkids. I have ZERO intention of selling a single iota.         I know I'm a retard, but this game has been rigged long enough. Time to make a stand.
I could only afford 1 share but my hands are pure diamonds. Also This is my first stock ever. And in 20 minutes I lost 10 dollars does this mean I'm one of you yet?
Many ape bagholders
Dont call urselfs diamond hand gme apes.  Call yourself trash hand gme bagholders. Yall lost it's over.  I'm glad I ignored all the hype.  I still am in things like apple and I haven't lost a single buck.  Had I listened to all your diamond hand bullshit when gme was 320 I would've lost all.  Damn.

GUH        True wsb retards embrace loss porn. BRING IT.
19 and down $16k on a loan
AND IM NOT SELLING, or whatever  Rocket, rocket diamond
Any 1 ply toilet paper handed folks here?
I KNOW I AIN'T. The squeeze might happen. Very possible that it's not happening.  To be honest, I really don't care.  Only the true diamond hands hold now.
I don’t understand what you people are afraid of
You already lost your money. What’s the point of selling now? Just fucking hold it.
Don't freak out like a bunch of retards who can't read
Just a reminder that /u/deepfuckingvalue said in his post yesterday that he is laying off the daily updates for now, so don't go freaking out like a little baby who lost their mom in the store when he doesn't give his daily update @ 4 today, dumbass.  RETARDS, WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION  HOLD, HOLD, HOLD
lurker still holding and buying
All the sales/dips coming from Margin Calls being called back?
Happened to me and many others w the meme stocks. Seems like a good time to buy again, but from fidelity. Looking for opinions on this.
This is it, this is the last dip and it's to the MOON from here   $$$GME$$$
The stock has just reached a new low, so many people who were curious about buying can now afford it. From here it's only going to go up. Elon is going to drop a big bag on GME, which will make so many other big investors flock to the circle. I think we have finally gained some traffic with the movement, and this is our come back. Hold your shit you dirty stinky filthy retarded apes.
a bit late but I am of course, you guessed it; Holding
The obligatory post solely for the sake of keeping eyes dry and spirits high, I bought in (finally) and naturally, (after a long thought out position) will be holding. Personally, it made me feel much better seeing some of the accounts on here sharing the same sentiment. So at risk of beating a dead horse into the ground, Yes we are still buying and yes we are absolutely holding on for dear life. The same way any experienced investor would with a stock position that has been planned out, slept on over night and reconsidered in the morning with fresh eyes. I am not part of a movement, I am an individual retail investor that really enjoys the company in question and really, really likes this stock. I'm going to keep it short, seeing all these words appear on the screen as I type them gives me a headache and if it weren't for spell check, you wouldn't be able to even read this. Godspeed.
Explain to me like I’m five.
I’ve been following this since last week and I’m all about buying and holding (but I can’t afford anything atm with student debt).  My question is if the hedge funds are so screwed and everyone is holding (mostly everyone anyways) why does the price keep falling? Is it the short ladder attacks? Is their end goal to get GME down to like $10 and then buy all their shorted shares? It’s all a little confusing to me.  Edit: Thank you for the replies everyone!!
Tilray® Exports First Shipment of Medical Cannabis to Spain
# Tilray has become the largest licensed cannabis producer in the world after its recent merger with Aphria.    The company was also selected by the French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified medical cannabis products in France last week.   Yesterday, it was announced that Tilray would become the first and only licensed cannabis distributor in Portgual.   Tilray’s EU   is well positioned to capitalize on the demand trend in the EU and in other international markets and we will monitor how quarterly numbers reflect the increasing demand on a going forward basis.     Tilray and Aphria as a combined have the largest stake in Canadian cannabis market, and are ready to expand sales into the   once legalization continues.   $TLRY is up   37%   in the past week, with an acquisition and full stock merger with $APHA inbound.   As   federal legalization inches closer each day, TLRY seems to only be gaining momentum.  With a       short interest, it may also be a contender for an upcoming short squeeze, similar to the one in 2018.
Bought GME to be a part of history
One of my friends told me he bought GME so he can tell his grandkids that he had his share of changing the current toxic system.  I’m 27 with no kids yet, and I just bought a GME stock to hold forever so I can tell and show my grandkids in 50 years that I was part of this movement as well and that I was on the good side - the side of the monkeys and retards. Oh, and because I like the stock. LETS GOOO
GME TO $1000 LMAO you’re all fucking dumb!
Get a job dumbfucks. Shorted the fuck outta you.
Robinhood and other trading platforms should restrict the ability to sell for meme stocks to protect its investors
Volatile stocks was the excuse to restrict buying in an effort to protect the investors on the platform.  Looks like volatile movements occuring in artificially dropping stock prices.... Where you at, RH?  All done with that excuse now that your own self interests have been fulfilled?  Not financial advice, but I'm buying and holding.

We've survived this long guys so just keep holding on and buy the dips.  GME and AMC  are still making the HF lose money. We just need to stick together and we'll be to the moon.  This is not financial advice I'm just a retard that loves movies.
Do you have GME buyer’s remorse?
Did any of you buy in above $50 a share and now you have buyer’s remorse? How long are you going to hold? Do you wish you could have sold at the 400 peak?
GME: both on buy and sell side, only 29 outstanding orders; first time I’ve seen this since this all started.
I'm one of the million lurkers of the sub, I know we need every support we can get.
YES, I'M HOLDING. There are millions of people supporting the cause even if you don't see them in the sub because they don't post (I know cause I'm one of them). We all stand together in this, keep the faith!     THE MOON BABY!!..... (not financial advice, just another ape who really needs to see something supportive after all those days of red... :)

This is your daily reminder to get out of Robinhood app
Use fidelity      Use Schwab    Use Vanguard    Use any other  I dont care what you use, Robinhood failed us and should receive no support from us, same with other platforms that limited buys that weren't on margin. These people "empowering us" kneecapped us when we relied on them the most. Post-GME (whichever way it goes), Robinhood posts should be shamed into oblivion.  Puts on robinhood 0$ 2/5

HEAR ME OUT DO NOT BUY OR SELL LET THIS SHIP BOTTOM OUT AND THEN WE CAN GO ON A BUYING SPREE
I sold today. Here’s why my diamonds turned into 1-ply toilet-paper hands.
I'm sorry you guys. Today I toilet paper handed my way to a hefty $18,000 loss.  I believe in the stock, and I believe in all of you holding it, but there were a few key things at play here that screwed us over.  Our brokers: the brokerages limited buying activity just as GME was gearing up for takeoff. This killed all momentum on the stock.  The media: claimed WSB was abandoning GME and gearing up for SLV. Also reported that Melvin had sold their shares. This created doubt almost immediately, especially amongst the newbies.  The bots/shills: came in droves over The Weekend to spread FUD and misinformation. combine this with the media   I wrote above and it's the perfect recipe for fear and uncertainty.  The famous people: screeching from the rooftop their support for the average retail investor when the stock was on the run-up, and then deafening silence when the manipulation was at play. Their silence further caused fear, uncertainty and aided in the momentum's downfall.  The SEC: coming after the average retail investor and investigating DFV, a regular analyst that did nothing wrong except share his views on why he liked Gamestop. He was shit on by all of WSB for months until the stock started taking off due to Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry, etc, and everyone wanted to jump on board due to FOMO. But no, clearly he must have done something finicky to cause the stock to rise. No way it could have been the hedge funds shorting twice the amount of shares outstanding, am I right?  And finally, ourselves: This turned into a cult, really quickly. It reeks of desperation in this subreddit (myself included). It sounds like an echo chamber in here where we all are repeating the same shit we hear from people much smarter than us, "shorts covering today due to expired calls!", "T+2" "short ladder attacks, everyday!", "low volume!", "Failure to deliver so squeeze in 13 days!", etc etc.  We abandoned critical thinking when we needed it most. The moment we lost the hype, we needed to explain to everyone that hopped on board the GME train, just why it was still a good investment with great potential. But we didn't. We attacked anyone with doubts or thinking of selling by downvoting and calling them shills/bots. And we kept repeating the same exact things, but when we people asked why this was all happening, it was nothing but silence. We let ourselves down. I'm not saying it's going to be impossible to recover what we've lost, but without some serious support from a large catalyst, there's not much to hold on to.  For these reasons, I'm out. Keep fighting the good fight, everyone, but it looks like this stock won't recover for years. I believe in Ryan Cohen and hope to see great things, but the value isn't there yet for me and many others to bag hold at this time. As always, I'm no financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Buy or sell, it's all up to you. I'm going to go back to sniffing glue and looking at the pretty green and red (mostly red) colors on my charts
I love losing money
When I initially invested into GME I was just a fledgling autist trying to make a quick buck. As it went up along with my P/L I began to get less and less satisfaction from my gains. I was up 100% then 200% then even more but it was never enough. Then Robinhood came in and all hell broke loose and all of a sudden the stock started to plummet. 350, 300, 200, 150, 112. As I watched my account going down and getting my first taste of glorious loss porn, I felt something. Pure autistic euphoria. God damn why does it feel so fucking good? Is this retard? I'm never selling this stock. It is a source infinite joy. My entire investment is well worth this feeling alone. I feel alive. I walk around the city with a huge diamond cock in my pants and the people around me can feel it in the air. I'm a changed man, it's like I'm finally rid of the burden of caring about money. I'm so free, like an ape, swinging from tree to tree in search of banana.  Thank you GME, thank you WSB  60 @

My Fellow Autists, Remember 2008
In 2008, when the banks found out their CDOs or Mortgage bonds were worthless. What did they do? They stalled, they stalled and did what? They sold their worthless CDOs to unsuspecting investors and secured their own short position to counter the losses.   Now I’m just a retard so I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about. But I do know the billionaires are selling the bag to someone as we speak. Are the bag holders the people taking new short positions and buying put options because the HFs are secretly going long because they know the inevitable? Or are the apes buying worthless GameStop “CDOs”. But if we remember in 2008 they were telling everyone and using the media to buy CDOs, Except this time the media and billionaires are telling us these GameStop “CDOs” are going to be worthless. The media is pushing us to sell instead of buy and trying to divert our attention to silver. Who is the bag holder they are selling to. Is there a way for them to profit from us buying more shares. Which way makes them the most profit us selling shares or buying shares.   The answer usually lies in how they profit the most in this situation. What the answer is, I have no fucking clue. I just see   I’m a   so I

Slogged it out on the streets as a paramedic in 2020 and threw all my “hero pay” into GME. Hopefully GME will superhero back, but for now I’m just holding and calling this my first loss.
This sub is now a cult. Peace out. ✌️
The fallout from this is going to be be epic. Lost life savings, divorces, breakups, suicides.   All for a meme.   Get out while you still can.

Hedging your GME long shares position.
At this point, no doubt the recent price tank has been challenging the diamond hands crowd.  Have any holders ever considered using sacrificial put options as what they're intended for? Not for gambling on an ER buy actually hedging your long shares position?  The 2021 02/05 $60 put strike has went up 400+% since yesterday as IV increases.  Just throwing out some suggestions for those with large six figure initial positions. Use long puts for what they were meant for, hedging.
Is now a good time to buy $GME?
I'm relatively new to the stock market. Is now a good time to buy $GME? From what I understand, you should buy when it's going down, and sell when it's going up.
I DIDN’T HEAR NO BELL
For all us apes still holding... what’s your price point?!
The squeeze only happens if we all hold. I’ve seen people saying they will sell anywhere from 1-10K. But if everyone sells at 1K it will never hit the moon. So at what price are you selling?

GME RETARDS HOW YALL DOING?? Genuinely curious
Short seller Hindenberg Research publishes short attack on Chamath's Clover Health
We have to do something.
Whether or not you invested in GME doesn’t matter. This past week was the hedge funds and wall street fuckers showing us who is boss. The short squeeze would’ve happened if they didn’t restrict the buying of the shares. They stole from us, they took the opportunity for us to make millions. But instead of everyone being unanimously angry at the people responsible-We are calling each other idiots and pussies.   Look at the media articles, the multiple attempts of manipulation. We are all still giving up despite the face that THEY CLOSED THE MARKET. Out of all the years of trading the ONE TIME we are gonna break even they restrict trading ? Are you serious? Is this not a wake up call, are you going to sit there and let this happen. If you lost hundreds, or thousands, you were not mislead by WSB. You were not lied to by Mark Cuban or u/DFV. The hedge funds fucked us, the 1% has fucked us. They are going to keep doing it unless we make a change.   The ability to change this begins with you, call your local politicians. Tell your friends and family what the fuck the rich people did. You are not the only person tired of stuff like this happening. If you want to see real change we have to work together to really beat these assholes.   Tl;dr - We have the ability to change the way things are. If you lost money on GME do not blame the people here trying to give advice, blame the hedge funds who closed the fucking market to save their companies. Let’s work together.
Monkey to moon strategy      🤲
Disclaimer: this isn’t financial advice, this is my opinion. Do not risk more than you are willing to lose.   Monkey strategy Step 1: Buy GME or AMC  Step 2: Go do something else, don’t watch numbers  Step 3: Hold till the moon       TLDR; monkey buy and hold banana  🤲 🤲
Just bought 25 Shares if discounted GME!!!
And I’m HOLDING to the grave if I have to!!
Emotions are expensive. Think rationally.
This game stop stock is going turn into many into a fountain of tears, for people not yet invested stay the hell out for goodness sake.  &nbsp    Now you have probably already responded with a reactanc bais doing the exact opposite of what we're told, especially when we perceive threats to personal freedoms. Like how you spend your money. Listen up!   &nbsp;  You came to WSB because of what is known as a Bandwagon effect the tendency of an individual to acquire a particular style, behaviour or attitude because everyone else is doing it. It is a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases with respect to the proportion of others who have already done so because you saw it on the front page of reddit with a thousand likes and what not.   &nbsp;  Confirmation bias is a thing it's a tendency to process information by looking for, or interpreting, information that is consistent with one's own  existing beliefs and that's why you all on here WSB checking each other out.   &nbsp;  WSB is a echochamber or rather the better word it confirmed to Groupthink which is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome.  &nbsp;  Some of you will disagree with me at this point due to what is known as in-group preference, is a pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. So go ahead and agree with each other in the comments section below. Just know that false consensus is also a thing.   &nbsp;  There is a reason why they call you Retard it because you are mentally slow to understand that you had to cash out last week.   &nbsp;  Anyway I guess some of you jyst suffer from gamblers fallacy it's WSB after all anyway.

54% of trades yesterday were shorts, or 120% of the longs
Yesterday, 54% of total trades were shorts, which is 120% of the long trades.  I dropped in a Jan 4th from a month ago to see what things looked like before this, the short percentage has increased.        Data from here.

I’ll take your finest pack of Crayolas. The orange ones are my favorites.
If it really is over and the shorts are covered, I'm considering the loss as paying for my first finance class. Going to hold because sunk cost fallacy and there is still a chance of longer term value, but let's be honest this ended up being like any other pump and dump, hedges playing 5d chess.
I'm just glad I didnt put in an amount that would ruin me.
I guess everyone is selling? Price is plummeting. #paperhands

Lost half my 401k what do I do??
Yes I know I'm an autistic retard but I honestly need some advice here. I bought GME at $100 dollars after a friend told me about it and watched it go to $400. I was euphonic and everyone here told me to hold, so I did. Now I've watched my life saving go from 4x profit to losing half of it, I haven't even told my wife yet.. Should I sell? Should I try to margin trade to make it back? I don't know what to do I'm desperate please help.
GME keeps falling every opening and closing.
have we lost or is this just a potential of a slingshot ?
Some Appreciation

Too much loss porn the past few days. Paper handed bitch right here, couldn’t even hold for a full 24 hours.
GME Reasons why I think holding is the only rational choice at this point
Based on my interpretation of this    In short, there are two scenarios:  A) Short interest is legitimately declining as retail investors lost their discipline and sold, allowing the hedge funds to cover their shorts and confirm the mainstream media narrative.   B) Critical mass of squeezers didn't sell and the short interest only looks like it's falling because the hedge funds are playing some extremely dirty tricks to manipulate the numbers, which they have a documented history of doing. The media loves Wall St and they don't know any better so they report that the squeeze is over based on the falling stock price even though it's not.  That said, retail investors either did the smart thing and only invested what they were willing to lose (so if you sell now you'll just cement your loss if you bought in when it was high or kneecap your gains if you bought in when it was low) or they did the bold thing and went all in on this (so you have nothing left to lose and everything to gain). It isn't certain that we are in scenario A but selling now would only make it a certainty. Based on low volume, the likelihood is high that we are in scenario B and the numbers we've been seeing are all just big market manipulation by the hedge funds which we've been seeing all week (plus a bunch of people losing faith and selling aka falling prey to the media narrative). In the unlikely event we are in A, investors have all already put in what they're willing to lose, holding loses nothing more, so if the hedge funds break the squeeze it's no skin off investors' backs (unless you went all in, god bless you folks).  So the way I see it, the only choices are hold and wait for the value to go back up (inevitable if we're in B), or sell and solidify your loss (and thereby ensure A). As long as critical mass holds, the hedge funds still have no choice but to buy from investors so it's just a waiting game to see when they'll stop fighting the inevitable and stop trying to manipulate the markets even more by scaring people into selling with ignorant media coverage and shill posts.  But I could be wrong. This is all just my observation and opinion, not advice. I'm just explaining my reasoning for continuing to hold. In my mind it's money I've essentially spent so if it becomes worthless, I already don't care. But if the stock goes up, that'd be pretty damn awesome.
I know many of you guys are going to buy more GME and AMC Shares tomorrow, with that said if u guys want more support you gonna need to get on the trending page of twitter, just make a simple tweet of GME and AMC and with a few thousand people it’s a possibility.
The trending page on Twitter is a powerful thing,  when GME and AMC were first   up they were trending on twitter, eventually dying down because of the weekend. If you’re gonna make a move go the extra step and post on Twitter. ( not financial advice duh)
Apes together wrong?

GME Bearish myths DEBUNKED (credits to ZACK GME-SH)
Apes around the world unite!!  🏻      This is not financial advice. There's been so many disinfo and myths and I just wanna share my thought for discussion. This is from another retail trader and i'm merely translating his words into English and post it here.  Author position: Diamond hands    Myth 1. Has the SS been squoze on Jan26 when prices hit 450+?  NO. Critical indicators of shorts covering are: Hiking turnover rates, prices, and volume. I mean, look at the fucking volume. The trading volume on 26th was significantly lower than that of the previous 3 trading days (21st, 22nd, and 25th). Lowering turnover rates and prices since 26th further prompted that people are not selling shit, but shorties continue to short the hell out of it; Therefore, I suspect the current SI% could be even higher than 226% (SI% on Jan 15).     Myth 2. Can shorties hedge their positions by longing call options?  NO. ITM call options would cause market makers to hedge their positions by purchasing the underlying share which results in price uplift (Gamma squeeze). This is what WE want shorties to do but they just won’t do it.    Myth 3. Can shorties cover their shorts trading back and forth?  NO. If we don’t sell, they are not covering shit. They initiate short ladder attacks trying to demolish our heuristics and throw our shares away. The true value that they have to pay for their absurdity is nowhere near the current market price. This is the chance when WE get to set the price by limiting supply, not THEM.    Myth 4.  Omg the current price is so low; Shorties are covering their shorts at low costs!!  NO. Same logic, they are trying to fool us on the fair value by countless shitty price offerings with new shorts (short ladder) and counterfeited shares. It’s simple af, we don’t sell at bad prices. We get to set the price when they are forced to buy to cover their shorts. THEY ARE NOT COVERING ANY SHIT IF WE DON’T FUCKING SELL.   TLDR: They are NOT covering shit. The current price is a joke. Short Squeeze will happen if we don’t sell.  🏻 🌕

German retard here - I DIDN‘T HEAR NO FUCKING BELL! I DON‘T CARE ABOUT -60 % AND I DON‘T FUCKING CARE ABOUT -100 %. I WILL HOLD WITH    BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT PRINCIPLES. In my personal opinion, GME will go to the fucking moon   (no financial advise). But, what we already gained is dignity and power!

I hear whispers earnings are to be revealed to be higher than expected soon and that we should load up on this one  ’s with me?
My DD on our boy Chamath’s CLOV
I think we all know Chamath was a proud supporter of the boys here in WSB, and fought the good fight when we needed it.  It’s time to help him out by saving him from asshole short sellers.  Clearly these big hedge daddies didn’t like chamath’s support, so Hindenburg published a report attacking CLOV. (As short sellers do, manipulated the stock down 10%).   But CLOV doesn’t deserve to be down there.  This is clearly manipulation.  This is a health company with a plan that fits perfectly with ideas in the Biden administration. Technology and health insurance combined into a way your average user can not only use, but understand. Unlike option Greeks. What other Medicare has the UI for a millennial like me but the simplicity a Boomer needs as well.  While everyone else is distracted by boring shit, we need to start paying attention to Medicare.  Chamath is paying attention to the future, and I trust him on CLOV.

Unpopular Opinion: u/deepfuckingvalue Played You
No more updates because I would assume he is out. So many idiots in here insisted to hold because he was still holding, despite his $13 mil in cash. He saw the short interest and played it well. Many of you became bag holders because of it. People passed on life changing money to be a part of a false cause. A slow, well thought out DD eventually spurred mob mentality. A different user name on Youtube and Reddit were used to help spread the falsities of common consensus. Mere weeks after horrible earnings, the stock tanking to near single digits and more store closures there was suddenly momentum. A generation of people that make the majority of purchases online and go to forums/chat-rooms to socialize, had finally accrued enough mob mentality to think a narrow focused brick and mortar store was worth something. The generation that spent a decade mocking boomers was now furiously climbing over each-other to support a boomer built business, convinced it was worth more than world-changing businesses like Google, Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, and life saving pharmaceuticals. The biggest story here is not the crushing of Hedge Funds that will recover, but the duping of simpletons that won’t recover.  Edit: For disclosure I played calls on GME when I saw momentum. Got in and got out.

The next play: YOLOing student loans on $GME
Alright folks, the dems are pressuring Biden to forgive up to $50k in student loans. If you're a college student, that means now is the time to take out (more) loans up to that $50k and YOLO it all on $GME. Put that college degree to work and turn those credits into                       (yeah yeah i know fox news but whatever. also this ain't no financial advice)  EDIT since some of you are that retarded: DON'T FUCKING DO THIS.

THIS SUB HAS GOTTEN REALLY NEGATIVE IN THE PAST FEW DAYS AND IT’S A REAL FUCKING BUMMER.  A FEW WEEKS AGO OUR MOTTO WAS DIAMOND HANDS. BUY THE DIP AND HOLD THE LINE. ELON MUSK TWEETED AT US. WE WERE THE FOCUS OF CONVERSATION ON ALL SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND EVERY NEWS OUTLET ALL OVER THE WORLD. NOW BOTS AND WEAK ASS PAPER HAND BITCHES ARE SHAMING YOU FOR HOLDING. THEY ARE TELLING YOU TO SELL. THEY ARE MAKING FUN OF YOU FOR BUYING THE DIP AT THIS CRAZY LOW PRICE WHEN THEY THEMSELVES BOUGHT IN AT A $100 AND THEN AGAIN AT $200 AND THEN AGAIN AT $300 AND AGAIN AT $400 AND THEN THEY PUSSY FOOTED AND PANICK SOLD.  THINK BACK TO JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN MARK CUBAN DID AN AMA. HE SAID  IF NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND YOU CAN AFFORD TO DO SO. FUCKING HOLD  ASK YOURSELF THEN WHAT CHANGED?  THERE IS NO NEW INFORMATION WHETHER THEY COVERED OR NOT. SO IN WHO’S INTEREST IS IT TO GET YOU TO SELL RIGHT NOW? YOU THINK SOME RANDOM PRIMATE ON REDDIT IS SUDDENLY LOOKING OUT FOR YOU AND WANTS YOU TO MAKE FINANCIALLY SOUND DECISIONS? THIS ROTTEN SHIT HOLE IS NOT /R/STOCKS ITS FUCKING WALL. STREET. BETS. WE ARE HERE TO TAKE MASSIVE RISKS BECAUSE WHILE THE OUT OF TOUCH MILLIONAIRES ALL OVER THE WORLD MADE RECORD PROFITS LAST YEAR THEY CLOSED THE ECONOMY SENT YOU A $600 CHECK AND TOLD YOU TO FUCK OFF. THEY WANT YOU TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER THEIR PRIME PACKAGES AND SHOP FOR THEM AT WHOLE FOODS AMIDST A DEADLY PANDEMIC WHILE THEY SIT SAFELY IN THEIR MANSIONS AND TELL YOU YOU’RE AN ESSENTIAL WORKER AND THAT WE’RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.  IT’S IN THEIR INTEREST TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE AS LOW AS IT CAN GO.  SO THEY CAN SLOWLY BUY IT BACK UP A LITTLE AT A TIME AND MINIMIZE THEIR COLOSSAL LOSSES BIGGER THAN THEIR WIFES DILDO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TRUE RETARDS WHO GOT SO GREEDY, A WEEK AGO THEY WERE ON THE BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY. AND NOW THEY ARE PULLING EVERY DIRTY TRICK IN THE BOOK TO GET YOU TO SELL AND CRASH THE PRICE LOWER AND LOWER.  THE PUSH TO $500 LAST THURSDAY WAS NOT THE SQUEEZE.  HOW DO I KNOW THIS? I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING BECAUSE I FOMOED INTO THIS STOCK BECAUSE I READ AT A 3RD GRADE LEVEL AND I FAILED ALGEBRA AND NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE BUT WHEN THE PRICE HIT $500 I KNOW THAT ROBINHOOD REMOVED THE BUY BUTTON TO GET YOU TO STOP BUYING. THEY CRIED FOR MORE REGULATION ON TV. THEY PAID FOR ADS ON CNBC TO GET YOU THINKING THEY COVERED. THEY PURCHASED ADS ON REDDIT TO GET YOU TO BUY SILVER AND DIFFERENT STOCKS. THEY PURCHASED BOTS TO OVERRUN THIS PLACE AND QUESTION WHY YOU BOUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACEE.  THIS ISN’T OVER. AND GME IS NOT GOING TO ZERO. IN FACT THE NEW CEO IS HARD AT WORK TO MAKE A HUGE COMEBACK.  NO THIS ISN’T FINANCIAL ADVICE.  I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING AND IM NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO. I’M JUST APE DIAMOND HAND CLUTCHING 70@100 AND IM NOT FUCKING SELLING.  THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.  EDIT: I DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD GET ANY POINTS. FEEL FREE TO COPY IT AND POST IT AS A SEPARATE POST TO WSB IF YOU FEEL MORE PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THIS.
Y'ALL WANT LOSS PORN? I'LL GIVE YOU LOSS PORN! HOLDING LIKE A TRUE RETARD. TO PLUTO.
Need an advice
I have $2500 in total on which I trade in Forex to make living, can I be diamond hands? But I don't think it'll help any way I mean that amount is really low. Any advice will be appreciated, thanks.
Question on SI release data.
I’m over exhausted from the past two weeks and can’t remember if they pulled the plug on the release of SI numbers for Tuesday. Reports were scheduled for the 2nd to be released, no? Why did they push it to the 9th?   Still entertaining myself 🎰, 100 shares @350
The universe tried to give me a sign today. So I listened and bought more!
🤥
I wonder if people who dumped all their life savings into GME on +300 earlier this week still like the stock?
For those who lost short term in amc. Remember there is a long term! Have some confidence and don’t sell at a loss.
If AMC's Stock hits $300 I will send Valentines Gorilla Shit to my ex!!!
If you madmen can get the stock to $300 I will send Gorilla shit with candy hearts in it to my ex with a note saying anything you want! Don't believe me? Here's the website I will use         DIAMOND HANDS MOTHER FUCKERS!
Still have my life savings into GME. I ain't backing down. These times are revolutionary- and we're all in this together
> 100k.    gang checking in
GME Volume question from a stupid ape
How can daily trade volume be nearly equal to or greater than the number of shares that actually exist? Didn’t volume hit 200 mil last week, even though we be diamond handing so much stock? I’m just dumb ape tho idk plez halp.     ing 7 shares @ $128avg  Edit: I just love this stonk, that’s all.
GME 2/5 and 2/12 800c high volume and OI
I know there’s been multiple DDs on this but could someone give me a clear explanation or their general thoughts on why there is so much open interest for the 800c expiring 2/5 and 2/12? Wouldn’t that mean there’s potential for a gamma squeeze upwards?  Could the hedge funds be loading up on these calls for when they decide to start covering their shorts so they can mitigate their losses or even profit on the way up?  I would love to hear from someone with a bit more knowledge on this type of stuff! It just seems way too unlikely that all the OI and volume on these calls are strictly from WSB trying to snag lottos... but hey what do I know (the answer is nothing)  Any opinions or thoughts are welcome, maybe somebody could clear up why there’s so much going on which these two specific OTM calls.
IMPORTANT FUCKING REMINDER.
Do NOT bet with money that you cannot fucking lose.   How is that so difficult to understand? If you’re taking out your mortgages, loans, and life savings and dumping it in this, you’re a fucking idiot. Don’t ever make this mistake ever again. You’re risking a lot, that you cannot afford to risk. Think about it twice, thrice, multiple times before diving in. This is not a for sure thing. Nobody fucking knows what’s going to happen. So please, for the love of god, do not bet with money you cannot afford to lose. It’s not worth it. It never will be.   With that said, all of you holding, please keep holding. It’s been a rough ride, and it probably will be until Tuesday. Keep holding, because if you sell now, you’re going to be selling at a SIGNIFICANT LOSS. What’s the point in selling now if you could just wait 2 days, Friday and Monday, and probably not make much of a difference in your losses but you could potentially find your way to the squeeze, in case it happens.   I still have a small amount of faith in this. But we need to have faith in each other. We need to be strong together. I know it sounds ridiculous but the big men in suits were counting on us to lose morale and start fighting with each other. This is how we start to fuck things up. This is exactly what they want.   Lastly, if you sold because your losses were too high, it’s understandable. And we still respect you for sticking it out for this long. But please stop harassing people for holding. Why are you mad people still believe in this? It’s their fucking money. Not yours. Stop being dickwads and just support those still holding. You’re not losing anything by just not fucking bullying them.   I think we might be able to do this. But we need to stop losing morale and toughen up a little. It sucks, a lot. It hurts. But, we need to stop turning on each other. There is no point, and neither of the two parties gain anything by turning on each other. Paper hands, diamond hands are not your enemies. Diamond hands, paper hands are not your enemies. Stick together for once.   I would also like to mention, if this post gets enough recognition, I will edit it to add links to other posts that I think are pretty good evidence that we can still make this happen.   (For legal reasons, I’d like to clarify that I am not a financial advisor by any means. I’m just someone who really only got into this a little over a week ago. You guys have been awesome so far. Keep it that way.)
I heard y’all like loss porn?
Let's support Gamestop. Not just as shareholders but as consumers.
For fellow retard    holders out there or just observers or fans rooting for the company and against the shorts... something we definitely do have in our power right now is to support the company going forward.  Shop at Gamestop. Order online. Buy the next generation consoles from them when available. Choose hard discs. Get your controllers, headsets and accessories from Gamestop. They also offer far more than games. Take a spin through their website. They sell TVs, speakers, headphones, iPads, toys, smart home devices, fucking hoverboards! Next time you consider buying an electronic, check to see if Gamestop carries it before defaulting to Amazon. And encourage others to do the same.  They have all the right pieces intact to make a big push into e-commerce. Ryan Cohen saw that and felt strongly enough to put up a huge stake. Now we're already seeing the leadership get packed with rock stars like Matt Francis. But it's going to take us, the consumers, to make them successful. If we translate a fraction of the enthusiasm we showed over the stock frenzy into   consumption of their goods, we can collectively have a big impact on their growth.  And who knows, if they retain a high short interest, a wild earnings beat could be just the kind of thing to set the stock in motion again...
Investing in AMC & NOK I know it's not much but fuuck today!!!!! got me rock fuckin' hard and ready for tomorrow morning to drop my check on some more stonks!! Hoping for more billionaires to cry, and ride this retarded wave to the moon with you lovely apes     i. am. salivating.
Why are you still in RH?
For the love of all that’s good and holy. Why the fuck are some of you, any of you, still at Robinhood? I don’t get it. Please someone splain it to me.  I see all of these “RH has pulled restrictions...” posts but you should have pulled out faster than your daddy did the night you were conceived. Everyone bitched about RH stealing stocks, restricting them to only 1 share, and on and on yet you stuck with RH like someone in a bad relationship. You KNOW you should get out but RH “loves” you so you stay.   Whatever. Enjoy getting effed on the next ride too.
AMC! I aint f $k'n selling! 1234 shares. Gonna add a '5' to the end of that number tomorrow. Hold!
PSA: Fidelity Refunds all Transfer Fees
I have always banked with Fidelity, last year I transferred the one free stock from RobinHood for free.    Robin Hood was trying to charge $50-75 on the transfer.  I told the fidelity rep and they took care of it.  Doesn’t matter how small your portfolio is they want your business and will cover any and all transfer fees.
Don't worry about it fellas. Just reverse the image and the stress just melts away....
Anyone looking at NIO?
I have read about NIO being the next Tesla, anyone investing in that?
Bring Back the Loss Porn
About 7 million of you bag holders probably didn't even know this is a casino. Nice job buying into propaganda blindly, you fucking retards.    A whole lot of    looking like 🤡 because they didn't bother to check what WSB was like before it was taken over by pack mentality and the media. But let me tell you, it's about time for some people to realize that much like the most recent SpaceX launch, the GME        to the 🌕 probably blew up in your faces.   And I want to feel bad for the young people that got roped into this, naive enough to think they were breaking the machine while actually being a part of it.   But I'd really rather just see their loss porn
Washingtonpost on WSB retards

Stop! He's already dead!
Let's review: VOLKSWAGEN VS. GME SHORT SQUEEZES (ignore this pretend analysis)
THIS TOOLBAG IS WHY WE HOLD!!!
Even with no shorts, $GME and $AMC are lifestyle choices. Don’t let this die, we’re history now. Fight the system, I’ll die as the -99% if I have to!
I put my entire mortgage on $GME... God help me...
SIKE I DON’T HAVE A HOUSE I LITERALLY L1VE IN A ZOO LOL
Is now the best time to buy?
I’ve heard from my son that GameStop is going to go very high due to the fact that there is not enough shards and it is becoming very rare high priced. Should I buy now? I have some 401k cashed out and just retired. Normally invest in oil.
tfw you try to stick it to the HFs by blowing your McDonald’s money on a dead stock, but end up homeless and the HFs r banging ur stepsister

Perspective on Schills
Melvin Boot flavored lollipops for schills is my fail safe to buy more GME!  So in my opinion the negative sentiment is being added on to by WSB’ers that stayed out of GME uptick and bought puts simultaneously with Melvin washing trading.   Class traitors and traders simultaneously.  I’m at 44 starres 200. Holding. Do you; but, think about it:  Buying restrictions at peak, then....  S3 reports 121% short interest only to revise to 51% instantly by excluding FTD (leads to Threshold)  Silver got pumped by schills.  MSM pumped silver.  After silver randomly accounts we’ve never seen start saying buy at this-x-time! On the same day as that SEC announced looking at WSB for pump-in-dump  Weed gets pumped,  closed positions because (I’m Schumer’s 43rd rank wife’s bf)   bought him cheesecake from Applebee’s one time.  GME ended at even 3 sessions in a row?  Sentiment 360’d then 180’d to    over 3 days progressively worse each day?  AMC and GME moved in lockstep over 3 days organically?  GameStop has been on Threshold list  This is not financial advice. I only bet what I could lose. I’m good at trading (don’t need to bribe politicians). I also eat crayons.    just speaking my mind.  1000% still not a meme bc these greedy Shorties probably tripled down on way down expecting to crash with 🌊 trading. Cuban: get stronger with price drops...  Thermometer is share price in short situation. Pressure makes       See above: this whole perspective is not financial advise.   Get this stickied or respond, if you like.
THE TIME IS NOW RETARDS! BUY AND HOLD AMC, GME, AND ALL THE OTHERS! WE WILL WIN!
THEY JUST REMOVED ALL RESTRICTIONS ON ROBINHOOD BUY GME LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
To the moon    🌕
It was a win.
Lots of doom and fingers in butts the last couple days... But let’s not forget, it went to the fkn moon. Take the win. Some saw the win, and took it. Others didn’t, and are now holding really expensive bags. Mines a Feb 2nd 69@$94 addition.    Honestly, I don’t like the stock, and I jumped on the hype train. (I learned about the stock rising from local media, the same media that started to shame WSB is the same media that hyped it, I only loosely followed WSB months ago) I do see value from the publicity in it now, and i see opportunity in it becoming tangible/profitable again. I’ll likely knock down my average, but I won’t sell this piece of history. We are however the definition of d-gens.  -This was not financial advice. Get good advice from someone who knows what your position needs. I once ate a spiders nest and chewed gum found under a bench at a bus stop. Sober. Oh, and worst of all, my deal is day trading silver.   Tips and tricks:   -I only bet what my wife won’t notice being gone.  -I always reconcile my loss before I buy.   Till we meet again. Freedom 88.
This is funny!
INTERESTING ANALYSIS
My younger brother is a freshman in college. Though not an investor, GME was a topic of discussion in one of his classes the past two weeks - so he was in tune with what was going on. We were talking this evening and he says “why in the hell would I trust Wall Street with my hard earned money & our government doesn’t even care”.  I think this may be a perception that many young people have right now.
Woke up from a coma. What happened?
+100% to   in less then one week

Let’s make GME and AMC actually rich
Since we are shareholders of GME and AMC, why not tell them to be revolutionary companies? Let’s sell the revolution,  , GameStop and AMC can sell merch with ‘GME REVOLUTION’ etc. Millions of people will want to be a part of taking down the hedge fund billionaires, and store lines would be a mile long. GME and AMC would have a backing for their wealth, and shares will skyrocket to much higher than they were last week. All we have to do, as shareholders, is come together and write to the executive boards of GME and AMC
Shorting report: Shouldn’t we be holding until the 14th/15th?
This is the date the shorting report is released for the month. Isn’t it better to wait for this DD before selling? Correct me if I’m wrong just a dumb ass ape....
Hold the line!  hands to the moon
Nightly hello to SEC interns and all bots. Hope you guys have a pleasant and safe night.
The whole GME deal
Okay. I heard about the whole GME and AMC thing because I go on Reddit a lot. All I know is that you all are doing a good deed by fucking over those wallstreet wolves. But, I’m still confused. How is this ordeal making so many people so much money? And is is too late to join in the game?
To everyone here who subbed expecting to make some money
Sir, Ma’am, they, ape, this is a MACdonalds.
Hold AMC??
Everyone better be buying AMC at dip. Squeeze to $150 a share... If not, AMC a good long term stock and expect $30 a share long term if not $150 pump in the next couple weeks.
Robinhood said they sorry and put y’all $3,000 back in 🥲
THE IMPORTANCE OF BALANCE: Was up ~$1,000 (unrealized) so gambled $500 on the meme stocks. Now I am sitting at a safety net still +$500. Wrecked a nice looking portfolio... but still eases the pain
Great catalyst, great earnings growth, with a little volume it could explode. Keep an eye out.
New Masterclass instructor  🤲
$NOK $NOK degenerates I'm still here   . I might lose all 16k but I'll let keep yall posted.

Guys i’ve been feeling pretty shit, i’ve got two shares at 280$ (a lot for me) and i’m a little scared since the bots. but i’ve heard the mods may be back and i’ve been seeing the positivity of the older WSB a week ago come back and i gotta say i’m feeling my more confident. it’s rlly low rn but Mark cuban and so many others are on our side. BUY THE DIP WE GOT THIS APES TOGETHER STRONG
This is different
This has to be my biggest loss in a trade and for some reason I feel no pain.
I still see robinhood accounts.
Why isn't this shit off your phone right now? There isn't something called commission free trading ... They sell ur info to hedge funds to fuck you over. Move to reputable platforms...
Are the tendies🍗 gonna be ready to take out of the oven soon? ( Still holding btw  🤚   )

Hear you guys and girls like loss porn. So Here i am. Im still holding because with it i hope i helped save a couple of companies from bankrupty. Companies that bring great joy to many people. Even tho i am not from USA. I hope more of you do the same. Greetings from the netherlands.
Here’s some AH scat porn for you
Moment of silence for these
You’re all right the subs turned into a shithole. It’s because everyone’s being pussyyyyyyy. people telling other people not to Trade with their mortgages and life savings, people behaving like    because daddy hedge fund took their money and they wanna act all serious. Stop grieving and get hype, don’t hate the ones that made money stfu and get back to business.. drinking piss and posting loss porn,  thank you.
Don’t spend too much on this!
I know this is a hard time and it is getting harder to keep holding, but don’t worry about losing respect to the subreddit. Don’t use up all of your money, keep a fine line between your stock money and your spending money. Stay financially stable.
Let's be real
There was lots of big talk on this sub and diamond hand memes everywhere  But talk is cheap, and when it came time to put their money where their mouth is, they FOLDED.  Let this be a lesson, that there is a very small percentage of ppl out there that are really about what they say.  If you were spamming diamond hands and folded, you are the type of person that never amounts to anything. And it is time to look yourself in the mirror and stop lying to yourself and others around you.  Claiming to be diamonds, but really y'all   Cubic zirconia
How I feel buying another 15 GME shares after a hater called me dumb for holding
This isn’t something new
WSB has been full of nonsense since before GME. Get Used to it.
Agreed
Failure-to-deliver  I've been looking into this a lot over this last week. I'm not sure who here understands this... however I believe that the wallstreetbets crew has exposed the biggest rip off in securities history.   We know last week on Friday, the reported SI% was 121%. At the end of that week... Thursday and Friday was the first time in history that people were restricted from only buying a share. I believe RH when they say the clearing house had a liquidity issue... however from what I've found... the clearing house or money manager only has to reconcile the financial transaction, and not the actual shares being exchanged.   When a short expires, the person or entity in that provision has t+3 (I've also seen t+6) to cover that position. A traditional retail investor is going to see that as of Friday... there was a 121% SI, meaning that the public float strongly supported a short or gamma squeeze due to the demand to buy.   Here is what I don't understand...   There is no ramifications for a hedge fund to actually deliver any of those shares except a small fine relative to the capital these hedge funds have. What is to stop any hedge fund in this example... or any future example... to not deliver the shares that are already owed, as well as continue to borrow more shares that don't exist?   The hedge funds could essentially short the market at the peak, especially with the reassurance that buying has been restricted... and systemically drive the share price down within the alloted cover time (t+3 or t+6)?  Not only do they give themselves time to drive the share price down (essentially reducing their cover expense), but also profit on the short position as the share price tumbles. The retail investor is operating on confidence that the supply and demand fundamentals of economics is on their side. However when you look closer..  that is all a facade. Supply and demand is fake.   There is no safe guard to the retail investor in this example. There is no penalty that is strong enough to prevent a hedge fund from over extending any short position in the future. All you need is a lot of capital and a highly volatile stock which conditions the money manager to allow an exceptionally high failure-to-deliver ratio.   Please correct me if I'm wrong because if I'm right... this isn't a free and fair market at all. Especially since hedge funds have very little regulations compared to other entities associated with securities.  Not   interesting
$IDEX has been pumping
On top of an apparent movie deal, this shit comes across my feed
A lot of people are gonna be milking this shit, that's a given. I haven't been here very long, and I know I probably don't have much room to speak for this site but I definitely have witnessed similar instances elsewhere. I'm reading about this coup that took place over a dumb movie/film thing and I can't help but feel bad for the real OGs of this subreddit. Idk I'm kind of ranting here but this GME Rebellion for the most part has been something positive for the average person, it brought me here afterall and got me thinking more about how I should be more involved with investing in general.   The greed that's on display now, coupled with the shitty ass rigged wallstreet game to fuck the entire movement is disheartening. Again, i don't have much room to speak in this group but myself here, but this shit pisses me off, and unintended consequences are drawing folks that are only here to seek profit at the expense of the integrity of r/Wallstreetbets   I have absolutely nothing to gain financially by participating, its a gamble but its not about the money to me. You all made these fuckers afraid of the common man and that's what the real gain from this is. I'd be very sad to see folks get demoralized and give up, especially due to internal scumbags trying to take advantage of the situation that never gave 2 shits until it became famous.  /rant
Founder of TesTOP, Elon
Just my thought. I doubt Elon is interested in this topic, and if he ever reads this, but I hope he at least considers engaging with GME although as it is very risky for him to take as his position at Tesla, but I think this aligns with his motto, for the people and future!  Some made big bucks or lost arms and legs from GME, but lets keep in mind that we love(d) GameStop once.   GME's fundamental is now enhanced with the new Chief of Technology from Amazon specializing in AWS and is more promising than ever before to bring greater business model expanind it to online market. GME party is over though, this frenzy(?) is now recorded in history and will be taught for our future generations. But what will be the lesson for future generation? Think of what we were trying to achieve and why does it have to end? Here it is my idea how it should continue.  Tesla also went through the short attack and Wallstreet never granted its success until proven. Where does Tesla stand now? Put it aside, am I the only one if Tesla purchase GameStop and its synergy can upgrade to another level? Tesla needs to increase more sales and GameStop has offline stores and its customers including those who fought against short sellers. They  eventually will be an owner of Tesla car. Who would mind a Tesla car with all features, like entertainment system, gaming, watching movies, real time video call, and virtual reality system, and so on? Combine GameStop and Tesla,  wow lets call it TeStop(Tesla+GameStop) simply. Starlink can work with those TeStop offline stores as basestation for high speed internet(5G, 6G, or whatever), charging station, and shopping stores, and SpaceX or Boring ticket office to another side of earth and even to the moon. You name it and anything is possible. Its only a matter of who can make it happen. A person found a company but who develop it? Its people like us. Now people is one of the most powerful company's fundemental that makes a company successful. And GameStop is the one. As always, any risk to one can be a perfect opportunity to another.  If its too long ro read, read below.   I like both Tesla and GameStop and I like it together.
Hold the fucking line!
Apes incoming, being able to trade stock isn’t instantaneous for people just starting out.
The $1000, $5000, $10000 GME Meme + BANK Tickers DD Destroyed a lot of lives
The original DD posts of GME were extremely good that were published in the month of Nov,Dec by CPTHubbard, Rob and others. These posts did an excellent job of saying why GME was a undervalue play and why people should buy into it. One of the biggest reasons was the long term play + the short squeeze and all these DD posts had a realistic price of around 100-300. More and more people like me got in early November/December before there earnings and we held, even though our portfolio was down 50% percent.  We were looking for the Q1 2021 earning's report for something to happen regarding the stock price.    Most of us were measured, only invested what we could loose, never formed a group or called any one else out when they did not believe in us. We knew the risks involved and still held it.    After the influx of all the new   the entire narration was changed. Every one who bought till 300-350 could have made money when the sold at the orginal meme price of $   Suddenly people who never invested before, who have no trade experience, who never lost anything came up with stupid ass DD like comparing with VW chart and came up with price target of $1000+ to Infinity and worst some conspiracy level shit. Downvoted some old sane people, who said take profits because we also saw our portfolios going from green to red by 🍊 man   Am tweets.   Because of these greed lot's and lot's of people lost there money, are in huge debts and may even loose family over it because of fucking stupidity of the   gang.   I even feel bad for BB people, who initially posted DD when the price was $7 -$8 but other greedy fucks who missed on tesla made BB, AMC and other stocks as MEME and made people loose even more.
WMT to the moon   as earnings near
WMT is one of the few high volume tickers below their month mean trendline right now without any major news dragging them down. There are lots of reasons to think it will soar, or at minimum return to all time highs in the next couple weeks:  - Earnings is 14 days away I expect a run up to earnings.  They are holding an "investor day" in conjunction with their earnings so you know they have something good to share.  - Holiday sales - I'm certain walmart killed it during the holidays, people can't spend on vacations so they are holding cash and everyone went into the holidays knowing their $600 stimulus was coming.  - Walmart+ -  Walmart+ is already estimated to be in 10% of households and is growing fast - you can say its priced in but I think the free same-day delivery is a real differentiator for them.  I also anticipate more benefits to be added to Walmart+ to help them compete with Amazon Prime benefits.  My play: WMT 145c 4/16  Easy tendies just riding the run up to earnings and cashing in prior to earnings. Im BUYING RIGHT NOW while volatility is low and premiums are inexpensive.  If you're autistic enough, hold some contracts through earnings - investor day is a wildcard, I expect big   I had to guess what we might hear: Walmart+ news, buy backs, dividend increase, improved labor costs (they are relying robots in back of house more and more).
r/wallstreetbets should add a gambler helpline to their page. It will only help guard against regulatory scrutiny in upcoming months.
That said, I know that there's a lot of people that are struggling with recent financial losses, but you need to take care of yourselves. I know too many people that have ruined their lives from blowing their weekly earnings at casinos and in turn take it out on their families.  The scale of the GME craze is another level. There are likely thousands of everyday people that have thrown out their life savings because of it. Please take care of yourselves.     Edit: Even if this gets downvoted to oblivion, I hope that there's at least 1 person that gets help.
Just watching from the sidelines
But has Vlad or RH responded as to why they ONLY restricted buying? Why didn’t they stop both buying and selling? When’s the investigation starting?
BEFORE YOU SELL READ THIS
So many retards have been spending more than they can afford to lose. If you sell, not only do you lose, but those retards lose too. If you hold we can all win. Right now the only people winning are the hedgefunds. dip your fucking hands in liquid nitrogen if you have to, just don't sell and we can all win. We're all in this together. Think of your fellow soldiers who took out a mortgage just to put it all in GME. We can do this but we gotta keep the moral high. If you do sell, I only hope it was because you needed to.   But I'm just another retard and this is not financial advice.
This one goes out to my big 1 share family. Fun fact, I had 10 shares at $40 a while back, paper handed and got back in at 334. My brain is as smooth as a whale’s ass.   🏻

PS- Still holding GME
It’s Not About Being Brave, It’s About Not Being A Moron
Do you like the stock? Yeah, me too. However, the squeeze either (1) is over or (2) won’t happen. Short interest is way down, and what short interest there is is already profitable, way profitable.  GME is down 88% in a week. If I told you this stock that just lost 90% of its value was a great buy, you’d laugh at me. So, what to do if you actually like the stock? Well, here’s some simple math:  Ron the Retard gambled his $1,200 rent money on 4 shares of GME @$300. His portfolio is now worth $200, a loss of 86%. However, he still has $200 worth of stock. If Ron uses his one brain wrinkle and sells now, he has $200 in buying power. Let’s say GME goes down to only a 400% gain in one year, at $20. Ron, then buys $200 worth of GME, because he really likes the stock.  Same $200, but one leaves you with 4 shares worth $80. The other leaves you with 10 shares worth $200.  Then, let’s say Ryan Cohen does the unthinkable - GME goes up another 400% in 2021 and this time next year it’s worth $80. Would you rather have 4 shares, cause you used your    ? Or 10 shares because you weren’t an idiot?  4x80=$320 10x80= $800  Let’s think about this another way. You have your$1,200 rent money, and some dude steals $1,000. Do you hand him the other $200? Fuck no.  Lastly, if you really think the squeeze will happen on GME eventually, why not hold 10 shares instead of 4? Wouldn’t that hurt the man more.  Don’t fall for the sunken cost fallacy. $200 is $200. $360k is $360k. Take the money. Regroup. And make the next play. Your losses are on you. There’s no prize (other than loss porn karma) for throwing your money away.  Don’t be brave to be brave. Be smart, when it’s time to be smart.
Sort by 'TOP' from 'This Week'.
Brings back good memories. I'm new here but that day feels so far away now. The spirit here was through the ceiling, off the charts. I've never seen so many people so united, so hopeful, so strong. I thought to myself, I don't care if I lose this money, I just love being here, the way we all came together in support for this cause. There was so much positivity. I don't lament the loss of my money, which I still needed, but it's the loss of that spirit from this sub that makes me sad.  I just wish it all comes back.

Ev company to be disruptive. Take a look.

Today was rough! Gather around the fire and listen.
There is no doubt we lost some good men and women today.  Some of you call them paperhands, I call them Brothers and Sisters.  We do not fault you for selling, you had to do what was right for you and your family.  Reflect and learn.

Right now, I STILL think they are full of SHIT!     I Hold.     I'm realy dumb and this not financial advice.

It’s over
It’s time for us to admit it’s over but that we had a good run: there’s not gonna be a single one of us going to the moon.  The moon was last week. It’s over it’s done. I’m Still holding for now but why can’t we admit it’s over?

Lmao who the fuck is this dork
You created a subreddit bro, what life story could you possibly have to sell to someone? Jesus Christ this sub gets gayer by the minute.
What the hell is going on with this sub????
Posts getting deleted left and right. Negative posts everywhere? I don't even recognize it anymore. For now I'm going to stop looking at this sub and just hold hold hold until this apparent enemy infiltration is over.
The suits have won, it's time to call it
Hey all you degenerates.   Our journey together has been unforgettable.   Looks like I've reached my limit though.   Don't regret a moment of this, we were all a part of history.
Conveniently doesn’t mention the manipulations, restrictions and other bullshit
If the platforms openly blocks purchases while allowing sells, of course it’s going to crush buyer confidence. We all know if gme starts pumping again, RH, TD and all the other fucks will just block purchases again. You all getting played.
Who was told you gonna get stock from #sofi at price like $13 but got screwed at open presale of $  ? They would let you buy unless you use market - Wtf not what i was told some assclown at sofi told me my error and he lost money too i dont care bs ! #Horseshit
No more limits on robinhood. But still get a real broker
Robinhood has removed all limit buying restrictions. To the Moon!

Now is not the time to hold GME...
Now is the time to buy GME!!! The hedgies have done a great job to bring GME back down, so that they can cover their shorts. They need you to be worried. They want you afraid and selling your shares so they can cover theirs. That's what this week has been about. Pat yourselves on the back, hedge funds don't pull this kind of collaborative market manipulation (flat out breaking the law and risking their livelihoods) unless their back is to the wall. That is what has been accomplished by a bunch of potatoes.   I know some of you are in deep. Yup, that's how it goes sometimes. But just remember that you're not in as deep as some of these hedgies who will be going to jail for market manipulation.  It's scary. That's how a revolution is supposed to feel.     [EDIT]: Robert Downey Jr was wrong, it's time to go full retard
Can Ryan Cohen sell his GME shares or is he restricted from selling?
If he’s able and hasn’t... we’ll that’s just about the most promising news we could hear right now. I’m talking big dick     to Mars possibilities if he’s holding.
GME Endgame - A Final Hope
State of Affairs    This week has been a rough one - portfolios blown up, dreams dashed, losses grudgingly taken. Lessons learned, "I told you so’s" said, confusion abounding. Some people are on the fence about getting out at pennies on the dollar; some plan to die with their withered fingers clutching their heavily devalued shares. Both of these groups are looking for some hopium, and I hope to provide that in this post with some actual information rather than the garbage I am seeing spammed all over this sub. My account is 8 years old and I haven't posted anything in 4 1/2, but I've been a longtime lurker of WSB and became enamored with the GME story back in November so I have digested about every morsel posted here since then. I am not an investing expert in any way, just doing this for fun. Shoutout to /u/FatAspirations for his great posts that really got me in this thing deep.    The Fall    We all know what happened here so I won't spend a lot of time on it, but GME is down 87% over the past week. I know everyone has noticed the stark contrast between the exuberant mood of 1/27 - 1/29 and the stomach churning disappointment of 2/1 - 2/4. Uncertainty about Gamestop is at an all time high, with people comparing different numbers as of different dates from different sources with no clear picture of what is true. This combined with an influx of new users, infiltration by bots and shills, and a struggle for control of the subreddit has left this place in complete disarray. Very few people overall and no one here can really say definitively why Gamestop took the plunge this week, but there are certainly no shortage of theories: hedge funds closed their shorts on the way up, hedge funds struck a deal behind closed doors, people paperhanded on the way down, etc. I am here to provide an alternate view of what happened that I've seen whispers of but not fully fleshed out.    The Theory    It has been widely publicized that short interest in Gamestop declined sharply sometime in the last week. Ortex's reported short interest declined from 51M on 1/27 to 39M on 1/28 to 29M on 1/29. S3 partners issued a drastic correction to their estimated short interest over the weekend, reporting a reduction from ~58M shares as of Friday 1/29 to ~27M as of Monday 2/1. This led the company, previously c  on WSB, to be denounced as being bought by The   am not so sure of that. I propose that while the estimated short interest has declined, there is a technical reason behind it.  This leads me to the crux of my     before continuing. I know many of you can't read, so have your wife's boyfriend read it to you for whatever it costs...  Didn't read it? Fine, I'll summarize. A hedge fund that is short a stock and facing a squeeze can write (sell) far OTM call options on a stock to a market maker. When the market maker purchases these options, the market maker has a legal obligation to remain delta neutral by essentially "naked shorting" the stock. This produces a wave of the "synthetic long shares" that anyone following the Gamestop story has heard a lot about. The hedge fund selling the far OTM call options then buys these synthetic long shares that were created by the market maker. The hedge fund can then report that they "bought back" their original short position via buying long shares, even though they really haven't; the synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call options they initiated because of the hedging of the market maker! By using this maneuver, hedge funds are able to report reduced short interest, but the short interest hasn't really changed.  Take a minute, read this a couple times, digest it.    The Evidence    I read a post the other day (forgot from who, sorry) that brought up unusual activity on the options chain for 2/5 $800 calls. I can't remember for sure what it was on Monday-Tuesday, but EOD Wednesday the open interest on $800 calls was 24k, with 16k more volume today (note that the 16k isn't fully added to the 24k, it can be the same option being traded back and forth). I haven't looked at the option chain a ton, but I do know that is pretty heavy volume.  Per MarketBeat, as of 1/15/20 the outstanding shares (including synthetic) was 102M. I am not sure if there is a reliable source that updates daily, but we know there are lots of synthetics out there because of the original shorting.    An Outstanding Question    The theory described above is on its face neutral; market makers create the synthetic long shares to remain delta neutral against the OTM calls that the hedge funds sold them, and the hedge funds buy shares to cover them. While the market makers undoubtedly are creating the synthetic longs, is it possible that the hedge funds actually   aren't   buying the shares to cover them? That the simple transaction of selling the call is enough to falsely reduce short interest? This I do not know. If the hedge funds didn't buy those shares, then the market makers "naked shorting" could be a large contributor to the drop in price over the past few days.    Conclusion    This could be the last gasp of a man that rose and fell with the Gamestop tsunami and is now taking one last shot at greatness before packing it in and moving on - I hope this post gives you that shot in your mind for at least one more day. What I will say is that despite the state of this subreddit, it can get better if everyone can show a little more empathy for others' situations. Some people are here to make money and read investing ideas: good. Some people want to use Gamestop as a launching pad for reforming Wall Street: good. Some people just love to meme and haven't even bought in: good. What isn't good is when you make low effort shitposts with rockets and diamonds and nothing of substance; I think all the aforementioned groups wouldn't mind these people leaving. Despite the language being stunning to an outsider, WSB had a culture that worked for them and new people visiting the subreddit need to understand what it was and why it was precious. The culture may evolve a bit going forward but let's get more of what made this place great: Insane YOLOs, unique loss porn, and the occasional DD that made you feel like you discovered electricity for the first time.

AMC and GME got put on the NYSE Short Sale Restricted list until 2/8
Hello fellow degenerates (never thought I’d say that),  Obligatory emojis:           At this point I think it’s safe to say that no one has any idea what’s gonna happen. If you do, please DM me and I’ll send you my two remaining  s while I ride out into the sunset on my gold plated Porsche  One thing that will be interesting to watch tomorrow:  GME was on the NYSE Short Sale Restricted List (SSR, no not the USSR) earlier this week. This gets automatically triggered if the stock price drops more than 10% in a day. It basically enforces the Uptick Rule, which says you can only short on an upswing.  Coincidentally, yesterday (2/3) was the only day since last Thursday that the price has gone up even slightly.  Both companies are back on it as of this evening until 2/8. This means the price may go back up tomorrow. If so, my smooth brain opinion is that the huge downswing we’ve been seeing this week has been massive shorts being reopened. Maybe the NYSE short data being released on 2/9 will tell us something interesting. Only time will tell at this point.  ftp://   Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice. I just really like these stocks because Gamestop helped me not sleep in high school playing video games all night and AMC has helped me experience the magic of 3D movies. Holding strong 9 @ 225
Stop with the GME, return to autistic Options.
Guys GME is last weeks news it’s fizzled out. The only people that are buying it now are all pretty much new to the sub. We can organize and bet on another silly stock or we can get back to talking shit about options.
Read this before you decide what to do tomorrow (READ)
Not sure why my previous post got deleted, but probably because of the title.   For the record, I am not telling you to sell or hold.   I wasn't going to write this, but I am tired of seeing people spreading misinformation.  To start it off, I do not care if I get downvoted, but the facts need to be set straight. I cashed out at an 18k deficit, do you think that was pretty? I made a gamble, and I got fucked over by the suits. Robin Hood fucked us, a long with a few other brokerages. Who is to say that the hedge funds didn't calculate this?    I've seen several comments of people saying, "wait till the 9th, new short info is going to be published"    Yes, you can wait till 9th for new info. However, you need to understand that the snap shot only includes info for up to last Friday, January 29th. This week was super volatile, and I mean come on, look at the price. It dropped from 200 to 50 in a matter of days. Do you really hedge funds are going to sit around and not make money? They probably shorted all the way down, bought puts, and repositioned themselves.       "They can't short anymore"    Says who? There was only a restriction for 3 days. It got lifted yesterday. So please don't listen to the bullshit people are posting.       "Average down"    People who are telling others to average down, but for what? People average down when the stock has the potential to go back up. However, the sentiment for Game Stop right now is obvious, and it is clearly not positive. Why average down when it keeps going down? If do you want to DCA, at least do so at where the stock was previously at before it got squeezed. I do believe this company can turn itself around under new leadership.    Should I sell?    Take what Mark had said for example. The whole context of his tweet was that, if you can afford to hold and see value in this company, then hold. However, at Game Stop's current valuation, they are not worth anywhere near where the price is at now. For those who bought in over 200 like myself, do you really think it's going to go anywhere near that price in the short term? Last quarter they had net sales of what, 1bill?    My thoughts    If you really want to hold and can afford to do so, by all means do it. Please stop asking others to hold with you because you think it's going to moon. The dd is there, and the truth is, we got fucked out of a squeeze -- one that is bigger than any that we've seen in history. That opportunity was taken from us last Thursday.
GME: What Today's Data Shows
I'm back again with the position-cost distribution update and an explanation for what I think happened today (you can see my previous post  . For folks who don't know what position cost distribution is, here's Webull's explanation:     Since today's price was around the most historically crowded points on the chart, the scale of the X-axis wasn't aligning with yesterday's chart anymore. Webull doesn't show the unit on the axis so I manually aligned the two charts from yesterday and today (by eyeballing):     Assuming that my alignment is correct and I'm reading this chart correctly, the pattern seems to be consistent with previous days: A massive number of shares have been added to the float again!  Putting the first chart I saved from 2/1 next to 2/4 and aligning them again I got:     My conclusion is that some folks have been adding a shit ton of GME shares to the float this week by shorting the shit out of GME! What is important to me here is that I don't see any evidence of a big sell-off on these charts!  After looking at GME's option chain again, I noticed that hundreds of thousands of put options (\~2m options, or 200m shares) were purchased in the last few days, a lot of which will expire in the next 3 weeks. So the short sellers are probably the market makers who are hedging the put options that they sold and also sell the previous shares they bought to hedge their calls (  reverse gamma squeeze!). I doubt that folks who have bought these options are planning to exercise them (200m of GME shares don't exist!) so the writers of these calls might have to cover their short positions once these options expire in or out of money! My guess is that on top of this many of the shorts tried to cover before Feb 1st so that the next official short interest data shows a reduction (that's probably why they also bombarded these three weeks with put options), now they are using all of that again to short GME and make back the money. As if magically total shares of GME will increase (don't get me started on S3's moronic "synthetic shares" nonsense: "If I borrow your banana, there are two bananas" is the kind of logic even a 🦧 don't buy!)!  My plan is to wait until the dip stops dipping (I mean they will run out of shares to short at some point, right?) and buy more shares! I think buying GME on margin is a horrible idea (some folks figured it out the hard way this week) so I'll keep buying on my cash account! I mean at lower than $50 a share, I think this is easily a value play again (  .    Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares and a few GME call options    TLDR; It seems like today:  🦧 did        attacked
Guys I think I finally get it!
So it’s like a game right? Buy it and hold! The longer you hold the more money you lose. I think they are trying to see who can lose the biggest percentage of their net worth before backing out. Only cowards sell and the bravest one at the end whose children will wear hand me downs gets the prize, which is owning the most expensive GameStop shares in the company. And for fun we got the survivors always throwing toilet paper emojis at the losers who can’t even light their money on fire for like even one week, which is fun.   Wow great game guys this is awesome  Do you think while this drags on we should start picking favorites of the diamond guys and betting on who will last longest?
In case these apes are wrong and you bet everything on GME
Members of this community are here for you.  We all know loss, we all have regrets. Opportunities we missed, squandered, dreamed about and lost overnight. We understand where your at right now and we're here for you.  Everyone makes mistakes, everyone fucks up royally. Maybe you spent more than you should, maybe you mortgaged off your house, maybe you did something so amazingly stupid you can't even bare to look at this subreddit. It's OK and it's going to be ok everything will somehow manage to work out even if you can't imagine it will.  Just remember this one simple fact:  We're all retarded.    I'm still holding with hope, I'm to far in to give up now, but I spent what I was willing to lose. My heart goes out to you retards still holding.
We all already know this but we need more mods to deal with people who are telling people stupid lies with no base. And if you’re new here listen to people trying to help you. We’re brothers.
Flashback to 3 weeks ago. We were all retarted monkeys but we were the good kind. The people coming in over this GME hype have absolutely ruined everything WSB stood for. We were a community that stood together; laughed with each other at losses; nut over massive gains over good calls, we were a happy family. It’s like when your parents tell you that you’re gonna have a baby brother and then he leaves a couple chromosomes in the womb. I think most of us wanna help the new people that aren’t straight up asshats but they feel they know more than people who have years of experience with stocks and decide they’d rather spit in the faces of people with experience. If you’re new here don’t be an asshat, listen to people trying to help you. That’s what we do here, help each other. We are a brotherhood of retardation and we can return to normalcy for WSB. But it takes (for the most part) all of us. Be an example of what WSB stands for.
Still fucking holding
AMC Months of resistance at 7 is now support. 7-21-36-80
Robinhood Lifts All Restrictions!
Just got a notification from Robinhood that they have lifted all restrictions! We can finally get back to work tomorrow!!! Let's go!!!
WTF is up with posts being dropped left and right? Seems like there's always a flag for something.........
Fuck you bots and the bits you rode in on🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
The only reason robbin’ hood is letting us buy GME, AMC, et cetera is because the shorts are over
Stalling the majority of investors using Robinhood allowed wall st to get out.  We got fucked. Never expect them to play fair, ever
PODCAST: "Wall St and the Short Selling Revolution" - Very balanced take on $GME
Has anyone run volume/ other daily technicals through Benford’s law? Not a mathematician here but would specifically like to know for GME and AMC with their tweedle dee and tweedle dumb lookin charts.
Benford's law states that the distribution of the first digit of many data sets is not uniform. The first digit of any random number will be 1 almost 30% of the time, and larger digits occur as the first digit with lower and lower frequency, to the point where 9 occurs as a first digit only 5% of the time.
Truly Autistic GME Technical Analysis- BOTTOM IS CLOSE, MACD Looks Amazing
should I buy GME at $25-$30 level?
I will wait for it to drop 30-40% more again from $50 Share price (sorry bagholders). Is this a good choice?   I am in Blackberry $BB because it has long term value with its IVY software and Amazon partnership
What’s the story behind the Twitter GME whale?
The dude on Twitter with the beard who dropped $600M on GME and now has since disappeared. His bio said he was rocking 10 digit stealth wealth. Does anyone know the back story to the guy?
Check the volume keep dropping for AMC! Looks like we Apes are holding it well
Are we ready for Round 2?
Buy the dip.
Has anyone else noticed that gme is on sale for a spectacularly low price?  LETS GO RETARDS  This is not financial advise.  I like the stock.
As Mark Cuban said, “the lower the price GME goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again.”
Robinhood has removed restrictions. The gates of Valhalla are opened. Let’s hope they don’t get in our way. Charge!!!
Can tilray bounce back to it’s 2018 share prices? Does the merger with aphria bring hope ?
Curious on your guys thoughts on companies such as tilary,aphria, and canopy growth
I really don't know what did you guys expect...
That's how it works..   1- You put money and take away the money from the ones that put their money after you.  Or   2-You put the money and the ones that put the money before you takes your money away.  Not everyone can profit.  If someone profits, someone is going to lose money...
Robinhood just removed all restrictions from GME and AMC. Like Cuban said, it’s go time boys.
I’m holding. I didn’t come this far for nothing  Edit: not with Robinhood, I use TD. Just trying to sound the alarm bells and spread awareness for those still on RH.
It’s time to formulate an elite KONG team that creates/updates one massive thread supporting the mission.
There needs to be an elite team of individuals all working around the clock to update one singular post that remains forefront to the page.    The mods need to assign (if not themselves) a group of fucking kongs that know their shit inside and out and can post/edit information that no person can possibly doubt.  The post needs to center around one objective:    The second wave.   The nature of the post should give everyone everything they need to fully understand what is going on, why and what needs to happen.  Most importantly,  legit information that supports this theory of a second wave without tripping anything that could be seen as illegal.  It’s a thread supporting a theory, not advice, not what to do, not what we should do.  Simply supporting the theory of a second wave.  Having a post that is constantly updated with a time s  update in the subject helps remove doubt and the spread of mis/disinformation.   Proving/explaining things such as ladder attacks and theoretical solutions for it let alone creative solutions that the community talks about but only sees it for a few hours (and is 100% legit) get added.  The community is encouraged to send vital information only that is scrubbed for legitimacy.  Finally, it needs to be organized and it needs to provide information to help understand other complex information.  Most importantly, the greatest service this post can offer is when it’s time to call it.  This does a great service to everyone late and uninformed and those that need to salvage what they can.  This is how you fix things.  HOWEVER,  before this,  the first thing that needs to be resolved is the integrity of the mods. If we cant resolve this, chaos will ensue.     I know we’re all retarded apes, but I see the kongs here trying to shed light on the situation and their post goes away 7-8 hours later.  Information is all over the place and our biggest problem is disorganization.  The mod take over is in part to blame.   I don’t know what needs to be done to make this happen, but if you know a mod (or are the mod) with the ultimate authority,  message them this idea to asap find the elite kong squad needed to accomplish this.  The Kong team will need to be okay with proving to the community you are legit.  Either the mod does it for them or them themselves.  We need to know 140% they are with us.  Lastly, for starters, the team should be composed roughly of:  Financial analyst(s)  Lawyers (in finance & investments)  Administration to organize the post and keep it current.  Mods overseeing the project that is beloved and can vouch with their life for those researching and updating the post.  And anything else needed to make sure the thread is bullet proof.
Hard truths from WSB veterans are exactly what's needed right now.
Lost everything on GME? Made a killing at the peak? Holding a worthless bag? Glad your sell filled before restrictions? Saved your hedge fund with illegal tactics? Farming socials for the next target? Lost your community culture? Found belonging in a unified community? Furiously scribbling fake news articles? Banning all your mods? Locking down your new community? Wish you never found WSB?  Good. You deserve it. All the information was available, and you made your retarded choices. The universe doesn't care about you, and it never will. You have to take responsibility. You have to find fulfilling relationships. You have to make sound financial decisions. You have to act in the best way you know how to improve the world around you.  Maybe you'll find people retarded enough to stand by your side and polish your brain into dust. Maybe you won't. Maybe we earned a wrinkle. Maybe the real action has yet to come. Maybe it's all over. Maybe it mattered. Maybe it didn't.  4 x GME @ $250 and holding because it's retarded and I'm no veteran. I'm at least autistic enough to not risk what I can't afford to lose. I hope many autists and lucky retards banked from the paper hands and the rigged rules. Maybe they didn't. I hope if they did, that they perpetuate the cycle of blowing it all and sharing the loss porn for feigned sympathies. But maybe they won't.
AMD $87 call 2/19 thoughts?
I can’t find the article anymore, but read that Melvin Capital sold long positions on AMD to raise cash to cover GME shorts.  Other than that, I’m banking on AMD to break $90 again within the next week once meme-stock chatter winds down
Is holding really important? Not financial advice I’m just some meddling kid.
So like many of you I hold a considerable amount of money in AMC. From what I’ve seen the two weeks everyone is saying “hold”, “hold the line”, “diamond hands.” But does holding matter???  I know as many of you know how easy it would be to just sell my stock and try to forget about my losses. But there is something that I know that always brings me back to earth.   The people who are shorting the stocks right now are waiting for us to budge. They are losing money through their ladder attacks (or whatever the fuck they are doing). They are trying to feel us out on when we will sell. They are seeing if we will sell for a big loss and tomorrow they will see if we will sell for a small gain. Every day after that they will start to realize that we won’t sell for anything other than what our hearts desire. That will lead them to the point where they accept defeat.   That will be when we strike hard and strike fast.     AMC TO $100     Thank you.
SO YOU INVESTED IN GME...
Great! Hopefully you made a little. If not, take this opportunity to get your finances in order! You don't need more money to analyze how you spend. Over time you can put small amounts of money away to invest. Build a portfolio around GME while you hold.   Or don't and keep refreshing these posts about  I told you so  or  should have sold  and mind fuck yourself about a current loss but not a final loss.  This is not financial advice. I put nipples on my beer bottles.
Friday Motivation
Buy. Buy a lot. Buy more. Hold.   Time to get back in the saddle and focus. No one thought this was going to be a cakewalk to the moon. We’ve had a rough few days and now we have the perfect storm to have a HUGE day to close out the week. We’ve got hedgies sidelined on the restricted short sell list, we’ve got restrictions lifted that were limiting our buys, we know roughly the number of true WSB holdings right now, and we have the hardest diamond hands history has ever seen. AMC/ GME to the moon   They think we’re done but I’m not fucking leaving! Who’s with me?

Is it useful to buy shares in CFD broker?
with all this propaganda and crayons in my head. i am motivated to buy shares in GME. But in my newbie investigation i was realized that if i buy shares in a CFD broker means that i don't really have that share because all is "simulated" inside broker. So i am confused because i want buy but I don't know if it works to do it from a CFD broker, i mean if a share inside CFD broker (Etoro for example)  push  trend.
We literally said we’re going down with the ship. We meant it.

Advice  From A CPA (Not Actual Advice)
I debated posting in here (first time posting), but a post earlier about not betting with money you can't afford to lose made me decide to post and I thought maybe a few people would find my comments helpful. I am a CPA and these are my thoughts, but I floss with pieces of string my dog eats and then shits out later so maybe don't listen to me.  1. First of all and most critically, this sub has   tendie-loving bastards, the majority of who probably acquired positions in $GME (and other equities) with money they could afford to lose, but there were probably some who lost their entire ass (and some) and maybe at risk of losing their partner/spouse, their house, car, whatever. If that's you, dude I swear, life will go on and things will be ok again. We all are probably familiar w/the Crash of '29 ( , upside down rocket) - stories of people jumping out of windows, etc. People were so blown away about how they lost everything in the market, they resorted to suicide. I don't care if you lost money in this gamble or not, if you or someone you know is in a dark place and/or contemplating suicide, don't wait, call a family member, a friend, or even the suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Nothing that happens is ever worth taking your own life and I guarantee people around you would care, and if you think no one would care, I don't even know you and just know that I would care. Whatever the outcome of this or anything else, life will go on and things will eventually get better. If you're clinically depressed, get help, please - talk to somebody as soon as possible and if needed, medicate yourself - anti-depressants can do wonders for balancing you out. Even if you did something incredibly stupid that will financially destroy you, it won't be forever and you will move past it. You matter. You have worth. Don't ever forget that. 2. Due Diligence (DD) is critical and there are ways to get started. First of all, if you can link up with an introduction to accounting and/or finance class via Coursera or another free site, I would highly recommend it. Basic accounting will teach you the basics of financial statements ( , what is an income statement? what do the various buckets mean? What is a balance sheet? Statement of Cash Flow, etc.?) basically the underpinning of the rules that are used to record transactions that ultimate flow to the public. Accounting or finance will probably teach you about common financial analysis and ratios (think current/quick ratio for liquidity tests, leverage ratios, profitability, P/E, etc.) and what they mean/how to interpret. But ratios out of context don't tell you much - look at the industry - major competitors. How do the analytics compare in relevant context? Also, a bit more advanced than basic accounting or finance but there are valuation models that try to predict company share prices based on methods like discounted cash flows or dividend yields and predict based on growth rates and discount rates where they forecast out the future success of the business based on harbingers like revenue etc and attempt to determine if the price is over/under valued in the current market. Also, make sure to read through the company's annual report - form 10-K (annual report) and 10-Q (quarterly report) on   is a great resource. Just type the ticker symbol into the search bar and search for form 10-K on the company's filings. In addition to the financial statements, there is a large section that precedes it dedicated to something called "management discussion and analysis" or MD&A that focuses on the company strategy and outlook for the future as well as risk factors. Some are generic like "shitty economy" but others are very real to the industry ( , we use a lot of adamantium in our products, so if we run into supply chain issues, we're all fucked, etc.). In that same vein, subscribe to the company's investor relations emails - you'll get news releases about the company as well as notifications for their earnings releases (where they talk about if they hit their targets but also strategy and execution).  Finally, if you have gleaned some accounting knowledge you can read the company's notes to the financial statements which contain more information on key accounting policies and other things. But even after all this, you need to reconcile with the fact that it's still a fucking gamble. Even after all that research, your pick(s) can still lose money. But it's just a more educated gamble than seeing people "YOLO" into a stock on Reddit and decide to throw ten grand at it (does not qualify as DD). 3. If that's all beyond you, hook up with a financial advisor at like a brokerage firm. They'll make a little money off your trades, but if they're returning 15-20% annually, it's won't mean much in the grand scheme of things. Some people like the thrill of doing it themselves others don't. And try to pick up on some personal money strategies, like making a budget and sticking to it. Automatically transferring 10% of your paycheck into a savings account (or a brokerage account). Anticipating unexpected costs where you can ( , home maintenance A/C goes out, $10 grand for a new one, appliances are expensive AF, water leaks, mold, if you have a car needing new tires, brakes, engine problems, or even just potentially owing federal income taxes, etc.). You'd be surprised how much money you can save just by not eating out or refinancing your house (if you have a mortgage consider a refi bc rates are really low right now but do your fucking research and don't get destroyed by a shady lender selling you a shitty mortgage).  That's it. I'm done. If it helps 1 person, I'm glad I spent the time writing it. But again, don't take my advice, I chug the stuff under the sink.
Fuck paper rubber hands!!!! I'm not selling it forever  🤲
RH lifts GME and AMC restrictions and SSR
So RH lifted their buy restriction, and short sale restriction is also set in effect. Will this mean tomorrow is much less pressure ok the stock because you can’t make market sell orders, only limit sell orders.
Hey guys MADE A SONG HOLD THE LINE $GME DOWN -$300
Hello. I am robinhood.
Now that we took millions of dollars away from you retail investors and kept it in the hands of the billionaires, we would like you to continue being our customers. Also, you can now buy as many shares as you want of gme because the shorts have been covered. Thanks for letting us ass fuck you without lube. Remember, we will give you a $2 stock if you get your friends to let us fuck them too. Have a nice day!
How long will the squeeze last?
Will it be at peak price for an minute? Hour? Day? I'm just wondering how closely I have to keep an eye on my trades.  Edit: dang there really are a fuck ton of hedge fund bots on here
For those who lost big$$$, some words of solace
Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.  Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.   Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.   Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass.   Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.   You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.   Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.   With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.  Max Ehrmann    Desiderata
The price is falling, the shorts are calling, stand for something or die in the morning. Hold the line.
Which one of you retards is this. NEVER GAMBLE WITH WHAT YOU CANT AFFORD TO LOSE!

Biotech impressions (Tiny D&D on AUPH)
So, what is everyone's view on biotech? I found recent success but can't tell if it's just luck. Every damn day there is biotech on top movers with 50+ percent move up.   Tiny D&D => $AUPH  Overview  In Jan,  had their drug (Lupkynis) approved that treats Lupus something... idk I'm not a doctor. This drug replaces an outdated treatment and is taken orally (nice). In the   between 200,000 and 300,000 poor souls could benefit from this after paying $140,000 a year (AUPH expects $65k net per patient) because big pharma is greedier than HFs. The important part is they received a patent for this treatment that lasts till 2037 so CVS can't make a generic over-the-counter version.   Why do I think it is a buy? It is almost back to pre-approval price (around $15) and for the very questionable math I did below.  Because this is a one of a kind Lupus killer, I am assuming they will get at least 20% of the 200,000 Lupus victims (40,000) X $40,000 net per (I am being extremely conservative) = a grand total of $  billion from the drug. Can they even sell it? maybe, idk I saw a few insider texts from nurses who received messages from the AUPH sales team looking to get something going. I don't care about that tho. I care about them getting bought out by a big ole pharma daddy for 30+ a share.
$BB INFO FOR YALL
I KNOW THIS ISNT A GME POST, BUT JUST HEAR ME OUT  Alright retards, I hate to see $BB get labeled as a full on meme stock as it has the best fundamentals and currently undervalued still. On top of all news from the past few weeks on partnerships and other catalysts. I figured I’d post up some more info on it from today.   As you can see from today’s chart, it finally started to divert from the main meme stocks now. BlackBerry is seeing significant order and backlog growth. 83% of the company’s software revenue is recurring.   In 2021, there are going to be many catalysts for BlackBerry. These catalysts will support the stock price bigly. Application providers will be able to get their hands on IVY in September 2021. 20 car manufacturers will be targeted. The good thing is BlackBerry will make a public announcement whenever one signs up. Also, BlackBerry is now increasingly free cash flow positive. This is a huge game changer for the company. Investors will value BlackBerry stock much more attractively because of it. There was $29 million in free cash flow for its latest quarter.  Price Target: I’m pretty bullish on it coming back to $14-15 by 2/19, with the possibility of coming back to $20 EOM  TL;DR: BUY $BB
🤚Bag holder waiting for    🤣 FML
You are here.
Stop bagholding and sell GME read why.
I love you guys but we need to let GME go. They have all created new short positions at the top and they probably made even more money now than lost since the new shorts are at an incredibly high 483 peak. Imagine how much new short positions this guy took along the ride from the 100 mark and above.   There is 0 point in holding now because you guys have no holding power relative to the number of shares in the market. No point holding and losing more. Average your share price and sell it off ASAP. Gamestop isnt a good long term investment if you got in above 20 dollars. Fuck even 10 dollars is a question mark right now. If you get in gamestop below 10 then long term investment make sense. Anything more you are just losing money. I feel bad for the guys at the 200 and 300 mark but its time to let go and at least get something back
Ok real talk. When this ape   is finished picking this assholes pocket, do you think he just turns around and gives it all back and then some? Hell to the NO. Act as if it’s your last banana  .
Now That Things Are Settling Down
Is any else starting to get REALLY pissed in hindsight at these virtue-signaling "protectors of the little guy"?  When someone like Chamath goes on TV, the first thing they need to say is:  "First and foremost,  "  Then go on your diatribe. Whatever. I was pumped seeing all the support on twitter and on TV too. But fuck, there are some serious consequences to your actions. Lots of people lost their life savings.  And I'm really starting to see some of these "heroes" in a different light. People I had a lot of respect for.  I'm not upset with WSB. I expect that here. It's our god given right as anonymous strangers to be retards and to encourage others to be retarded.  But these guys have a responsibility. Of course, they can also do and say whatever they want. That's their right.  It's just really disappointing.     Oh and PSTH is Stripe.
If this hits $500 I’ll tattoo a   flying into my nipple

Previous post got removed so posting it again. Remember, you can write off your stock market losses as tax-deductible. This will truly be the most non-bullshit thing you will read and learn today. Save this post somewhere.
This is not financial advice, I am writing this because hopefully it will benefit some of you. So you have lost a lot of money in GME or AMC or the stock of your choice over the last few days. I am sure you are feeling pretty hopeless, and trust me, I am there with you.   But did you know that you can offset this loss by reporting it to the Internal Revenue Service and use it as a tax-deductible? Internal Revenue Service allows you to report realized capital loss up to $3000 on the taxes you file and deduct that amount from your overall taxable income.     What is a realized capital loss?    Simply put, it is the loss you have sustained after selling your stocks at a price below your buying price.     This is great. How much money can I write off?     $3000. It will be deducted from your overall taxable income.     What if I have more than $3000 in loss?    Internal Revenue Services allows you to carry over the remaining loss over the first $3000 over to your next year's taxable income.     How do I do that?    Along with how you regularly file your taxes, you would need to fill out Form 8949 and schedule D for your tax return.     What if I have gained some money and lost some?     If you are in net gain, you will report this income to the Internal Revenue Service, and will be taxed for that. If you are in net loss, you will report this net loss to the Internal Revenue Services for the tax credit. That is, your total gain from the market-your total loss from the market. If this number is negative, you qualify for getting this deduction.     This link will give you a good idea about the concept:        If you are still with me:    If you are new to stocks, believe me, this will not be your only loss in the market. Sometimes you will win big, you will lose big. Just remember to learn from both of them. Find out what you did right and keep trading and investing that way. Find out what you did wrong and avoid that in the future. No matter what people say, always remember, it is your money, and it will impact your future. Good luck!   Edit:   There seem to be a few common questions, I will answer them here.   What if I haven’t sold?    Then this does not apply to you. It is only applicable on realized losses,   the losses that you incur after selling   Will this apply to 2020 taxes or 2021?   2021  Is this US only?  Yes, but I believe British tax rules also have a similar position. If anyone knows about other countries, drop a comment and I will update it here  So will I get 3000 off my taxes?   No. It will be applied to your Taxable income. For example, if your taxable income was $50,000 and if you have incurred $3000 in loss in the stock market, your taxable income after this provision will be $47,000.  You should also know the washsale rule, which states that if you have sold and bought the same stock again in 30 days, you will not be qualified for this provision. So if you have already cut your losses, it is better to stay out now, unless you’re absolutely sure that you will make back your investment and more profit.  Again, I am not a financial advisor. Check with your advisors before you act on anything
GME like Consoles
Isn't it like an new console release with low volume like ps5 or xbox series x?  Everybody bought it before release. At release not everyone got one, markets are sold out. So some scammers who bought more just to sold them at the point no market has rest positions für like double the retail price. So lets HOLD until the hedgies need their GME Console while the volume is still low, they will buy it at a much higher price, but i'm just retarted, this ist not financial advise.
I’m ready to get banned.
No honor among thieves?
The majority of diamond hands on here were just trolls that sold GME at $400 or so. The true losers are people who spent money they could not afford. Sad but true many people calling out people for selling but they sold or did not even have shares to begin with.   It’s easy to find pictures on google of GME shares bought at any price.
Robinhood finally removed temporary bands. You can buy as much GAME STOP as you LIKE!
Robinhood has finally removed ALL limits on $GME and $AMC!
Need more loss porn
There isn’t enough loss porn on this page where r the retards who r still holding GME post shit so I can show my stepsister
They’re Trying to Break Us
But it isn’t going to work on me!  Why?  Because I fucking love this stock and everything it symbolizes not just to me, but to so many of you.  So I hold for me!  I hold for you!  I hold for us!  For those of us who banded together on this!  My newfound brethren!  The bunch of fucking apes I never knew I needed to be a part of!  We might have come to WSB as individual apes, but I have never felt more like a Troop in my life!  So that’s why I’m gonna fucking hold my GME and AMC so that enough of my fellow apes can get out with a profit if they really need to.  This was a gamble I never expected to win so I have no problem holding the door if any of you need to escape.  I’ll understand.  But you can count on my diamond hands till the end!  I know we don’t say it too often in this group, but I love you guys!   🤲🏽   for life!
Stock dilution. When Gamestop pulls the rug out from under our feet it will be the final straw
AMC has pulled in over 600 million off the board. Retail investors saved the movie theaters! But every day that Gamestop does not do the same and take some of this money off the table they are losing their chance of consolidating serious debt. I understand why they didn't do it early in the movement as they would betray their users but I feel like its coming and most of you haven't thought about it. If Gamestop makes the smart decision and offers more stock the price is going to go down faster than your wife on her brand new boyfriend.  I am NOT saying to wave the white flag. I LOVE the loss porn as the sub was born on it BUT I am seeing posts about retirement funds emptied to buy more and people are forgetting that Gamestop hasn't consolidated any debt... YET.   Fuck it buy TSLA and hope Papa Elon buys GME, its a win win.  Papa hates the shorts just as much as you do.  Okay bring on the pitchforks now.  TLDR. If GME takes money off the table we WILL lose it all. Trim your positions by 25% and enjoy the ride. If you put all your eggs in one basket we all get salmonella. Here come the down votes
It’s time folks
Folks, Jesus was out on the desert 40 days and nights with demons mocking him. Don’t ever be swayed. The hedgies obviously need your shares at the end of the day. I’m holding
Best case scenario for WSB Post:GME
Those same mods who monetized and ruined WSB for money, should face maximum penalty. They risked it all, and now they should lose it all. Make an example, otherwise monetization of this sub will happen again... for a 3rd time.
I didn’t hear no bell 🥊🍿
Discussing the future of retail trading
Will the government/SEC be updating us news about particularly what’s happened the past week (GME / AMC etc) ? Let’s say the government/SEC side with the HF (does anyone know the next dates they will be updating this is on?) I’m sure there are people around the world who will now distrust retail trading & the lies of being it a free market .. let’s discuss
Who knew Hedgefunds weren't going to rollover in just a few days and pay out billions to WSB
Seriously, get a grip. It's going to take some time but it  will  happen some time, it has to because they're so shorted and paying a ton in interest.   Current market price means nothing. They can bring the display price down to $2 but if no-one is actually selling it for that, then it doesn't matter.  Also it's not hard to hold at the moment, when it's so far in the red - your real test comes when it starts booming, whether you sellout to break even or at the first sign of a dip, or you ride this baby all the way to the MOON.
Super early amc hold but sold some recently to buy 10 of gme. I believe In the future of wanting the past again before covid.
WE'RE BACK BITCHES!   Unbanned and still holding GME
Guys is the moon below us or above us?
BlackRock Inc. Disclosed Holding   Million $AMC Shares with SEC form on Feb 2nd! Good News! Form Linked.
On Feb. 2, BlackRock Inc. has filed an SC 13G form with the SEC disclosing ownership of 6,211,222 shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.. This represents   ownership of the company. In their previous filing dated 2020-12-08, BlackRock Inc. had reported owning 3,901,649 shares, indicating an increase of    Form:      This seems like a positive sign that the company could have big potential in the future, based on their track record.
Pulling out of AMC and BB to put all of the remaining money into IDEX. Thoughts? I’m down so much money in both, but IDEX has made me stay even anyways. Time to sell, or time to hold?
How long becore we see the GME Gofundme’s? “Please help lost all my money on GME”
$  to $175k in 3 months - $10k NCLH in Nov, $116k GME and currently up ~$20k CRSR
Well if you say so...
Webull says peak price at 483... Anyone of you retards buy the top? Would love to see it.
I pray for you buddy
Just as Leonidas said, HOLD.
This is the spark that ignites the powder keg. This is a revolution in power and wealth. Just as ALL of our ancestors stood their ground against tyranny, against corrupt and absolute power, we must hold. It’s science, we hold, demand soars. Billionaires become millionaires and so do we. This is the great opportunity to be on the right side of history. So dig your feet in, steady your nerve, and. Hold. Your. Ground. Men.   I LOVE this stock.
pre GME wsb was so much better than the dumb fucking shit being posted now. all i see is diamond hands and hold and it’s so fucking dumb just stop the bullshit
$GME Short interest at

THEY REMOVED ALL THE TRADING RESTRICTIONS GME IS NOT DEAD!!!!
For the small timers holding the line. Remember that you can write off up to $3k of short term loss in any given year.    🏽, my friend.
I love this gaming company I am in on this too
realistically what numbers are realistic after this new momentum change?
For GME i think i could be bagholding my diamonds for fun cuz why not. but i still like to keep at least 1 stock  But for AMC there is a game to be held.
Is poshmark a buy?
Let's see it to the end...
GME Nothing left to do but HOLD HOLD HOLD
95 shares @ 150 and I'm holding the bag. Good vibes only - who wants to eat crayons with me?
GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT GME!!
So I was late to the party on GME and was too high for my taste but I got in with AMC. However, I think GME is right at the cusp of this. Just my opinion!
Robinhood is now only accepting limit sells up to $5,000. This is different than a few days ago when I was able to set my shares for $999,999,999,999.
Honestly, gamestop is dropping fast, is there actually any chance of it bouncing back?
Ready to sell...
All of my fucking other stocks to buy more AMC, dont forget about amc, rocket fuel hands
I ain't selling, hold the damn line!!
Heard of Investor Relations?
Spent 6 hours trying to get enough karma on AskReddit to make this post.  I've been constantly reaching out to Investor Relations at our favorite movie theatre chain:    There is one guy who runs the show there, John Merriwether; he is VP of Investor Relations.  John has been sitting comfy in his seat for 6 years. Despite the massive influx of attention, he has yet to say a word or put out a press release. As our rocket ship prepares to take off, why don't have any sort of participation?  I encourage each and every shareholder / options holder to email him and plead OUR case. He can be reached on LinkedIn ( . EVERYONE from CEO, COO, CFO, etc. can be reached there.  The more pressure we apply, the sooner he will act. It is in their best interest to do so!!!  TL;DR: EMAIL AMC investor relations and let them know how big a community is waiting for them to put out a squeeze, I mean press, release.

Honest Opinion
Yo DONT listen to all of these random bearish accounts. I know not a lot of you may know this but last night this sub got hijacked. This sub is filled with spies and bots. Don’t listen to them they are working for the ENEMY
Just hold you retards
The fact of the matter is that regardless of what anyone has to say on the matter you don't loss the money until you sale. I dont care if the current stock price is $  or $  Just hold the line... You have nothing left to lose.  Not financial advise I'm a retard  Newer to the sub but I am a proud owner of some nearly worthless stock  Apes strong together
THE FEB 9 SI NUMBERS COULD BE RIGGED
Don't be alarmed if the SI % data that comes out on Feb 9th is seemingly low, this is because while the real number of SI % is actually quite high they may report deceptive figures that include synthetic longs to make it "appear" as if they have covered as S3 Partners have done.     Yes, this is more bullshit they could be playing.   I'm not a financial analyst im just holding cus i like the stock
Boycott Robinhood
Time to boycott Robinhood after they turned their backs on us apes. Never going back.
Is anyone else seeing this on GME?
They think they’ve won the battle. But in my experience, the retards who don’t give up always end up winning. Them lowering the prices for us means it’s so much cheaper to buy more!!!! Not to mention those call options. From all the gains I’ve made I will be adding a new fleet of shares to my portfolio. Hang in there fellow brothers and sisters. Look at the better picture here on how they have blessed us with fire sales!   🌕.
GME, can someone explain?
Not trying to be paper bitch, loss around 60% now, overall not big money, only 3-4 stock at around 97. But as I saw all the post that asking to hold are mostly bought at 250+, where’s those OG that bought below 50 and still holding? Saw someone said that hedge fund are shorted again at around 400, and sell it to us, is that even possible?  For sure still holding.  GME🌕
Yesterday versus Today! Hi SEC. We’re all human here. When we get excited about something, we’re going to of course, encourage our friends to check it out. Doesn’t matter what it is- could be food, a movie, games, stocks, etc. We all ultimately make our own choices though ❤️
What option is there?
What Options Are There?  I’m in a pickle, I’ve lost it all, including my sanity. I’m not asking for financial advice, but I’d like to know my options.   I bet more than I could afford, I borrowed money from friends to get a measly 19 shares of GME at average 192 each. I used Fidelity to buy more than I had in the bank, so I borrowed and deposited. I didn’t deposit fast enough since they are on ET and I’m on the west, I was 30 mins late and the reversed one of the deposits which was $1000.   I busted my ass with a $1000 cosplay commission(my first actually) and am getting paid today, but it’s too late, Fidelity liquidated my positions, including most of my AMC. I still have 6 on RH but I never intended on my diamond grip being cracked open. GME was too low and I was in it for the long haul.   I’m debating on just buying them back on RH. I can’t afford to, but I’m already fucked, why not at least get back in the game. Just like in V for Vendetta, I didn’t want to give my last inch.   What options are there?  Love, a fellow retard.
What now?
Great gaming play
Haven’t sold and still losing. Certified regard here!
For those of you beautiful apes that are still hanging in there with me
Have Faith. Hold this incredible fucking stock AT LEAST until the short interest is published on the 9th. I am such a fucking retard but god damnit I really do believe the short interest that's published on the 9th will be higher than most people now expect, and if it is, a very legitimate round 2 could be sparked.  Either way, most of us who are still in it know what it's like to sail over the peaks and crash into the valleys - we've been through it all with GME. WE LOVE THE FUCKING STOCK. AND WE WILL SOON RIDE PAST THOSE PEAKS STRAIGHT TO THE FUCKING MOON.  IM RETARDED, I BELIEVE, AND I REALLY LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK.
YOU STILL HOLDING ???
7 dollars to invest
I'm broke trying to change my luck what do I invest in
Robinhood sold my shares
I'm new to all this and def retarded. I only held a few shares and robinhood was holding my money hostage ( was deposited before all their shenanigans started but still hasn't left my bank, so technically there was nothing to withdraw ) they still let me buy shares essentially on credit, and was holding with you fine people. They sold my gme and nok shares today saying it was "for my benefit". What do?
Congratulations to the class of 2021!!!
When I look out upon this sea of young, eager faces, I see so much potential. Here is the class of 2021. You’ve paid your tuition. You’ve earned the education. Now, you can swear off trading for the rest of your lives and soon you’ll figure out how this shit REALLY works. Next time, you’ll come back and this time you’ll do it with discipline, rigor, and absolutely no toilet paper hands.   Because you know what could have happened if only you    , you know. You could have been a winner.  And that, my friends, is your WSB education. I am a three time graduate of this fine institution. I was trying to get tendies back before tendies were called tendies. And I’ll be here tomorrow when we don’t call them tendies anymore. But when I come back, it’s going to be with a SYSTEM.
Are You Really Watching GME?
After doom-scrolling through the posts here for a little while and listening to all these people cutting and running, talking about losses, I have to wonder - do any of these guys really like the stock?   You've likely heard about the new hires over at Gamestop. They're trying to change things up and modernize. The ape meme was fun and all, but maybe we should be something with more patience. Even if we don't end up taking this ship to the moon, I'm pretty sure we can do better than we're at now. At the very least not lock in these losses.  But don't take it from me, I aint right in the head. This isn't financial advice.. I just like the stock.
Dropped like a rocket on a meme stock. Fml 🤦‍♂️
History Repeats?
I found this story very appropriate for today.      “  as he was about to win the squeeze...  all trading was halted...”
BABY LOSS PORN, STILL HOLDING STRONG. All in or no in.   🏼
Since hedge funds scanning WSB for popular mentions to try to stay ahead of the game, should we try to mention a random stonk in every comment? Silver (a Reddit award) is often mentioned in WSB, and out of the blue the media reports WSB is buying silver. Throw the hedgies off! BRKA REYN SNPW
Dear robinhood..
Honestly, I would forgive you guys for all the bullshit you put me through and the thousands of dollars you cost me if you guys made it possible for me to day trade options with a cash account. Nearly every other brokerage allows people to do it! You guys fucked up pretty bad, I think doing this could possibly save you.   , Fuck you for causing so many people to lose money

What trading app is the best?
I’m getting into trading and I’m wondering what you guys think the best trading app to use would be?   Edit: I am aware of what happened with Robinhood and I know to stay away from that
Research
Okay so I’m somewhat new to stocks and very new to trading aggressively. What would be some key topics to research? I’m currently looking into how to down trends and dips in order to predict a bull( Idk the right terminology to use there) Any help is appreciated  Not an ape lookin for what to buy just trying to develop my skills and get better thanks in advance.
This has been amazing to be apart of what feels like history, when I saw this community, and the undertaking, I thought, man, if this shit takes off, I might be able to pay off my student loans, put a down payment on a house, and get my girlfriend an engagement ring she
Can someone please explain why GME stock price has dropped all of a sudden? Are we going to the moon  ‍♂️?
I'm a new comer to the stock market game and I understand the concept of shorting. Everything was very clear to me until gme share prices just fell all of a sudden. Someone please explain xD Thanks!
Sorry but I'm not believing all this quitting conversation and tone I am seeing.
Rough day and people are on here talking like it's over?!?! When it was nothing but badass silverback, diamond handed beastly simpletons yesterday?!?! I make my own decisions, I am not an expert, but I am EXTREMELY hard headed. The only thing I know for sure is I haven't lost anything until I sell. So I'm perching on my rock with an empty head, a puffed chest, dead eyes and    🏾  !!!! I'll ride this bitch to zero IDGAF 🔥 🌔
GME looking much more similar to the 2000’s dot com bubble than the short squeeze of 2008
It's time to distance ourselves from the memes/noise.
Squeeze already happen? Squeeze still happening? Shorts have closed?   We won't know until the 9th so why worry about it?  For those that threw all their money at this, money that secures your livelihood, your children's, etc., I feel for you because I can understand why you're worrying.  I did my DD before I took on this bet. That's right, 'BET'.  Sure, there's a possibility to win (and win big) in the case of $GME but don't let that hide fact that you can also lose. What happens if you bet everything? You lose everything.  Let this be a lesson in investing 101. If you did your DD, then more power to you and I hope for the best outcome. Holding 32@308 long because I genuinely like the stock.  How deep into your pockets have you gone?  This is not financial advice.
GME IS OFFICIALLY A MONEY POT NOW
Stop going full retard and go learn why there is no more to the moon... hold the line was a concept solely based on short interest.... the HF weaseled their balls out of the vice grip last week so the game is OVER... save your fucking money at this point otherwise you are donating to other people in a damn raffle contest.
If you were the hedge funds what would you do?
I was thinking about the gme situation and I think we underestimate hedge funds, like we have this idea that they are some stupid people, but they are probably smarter than we think. So I tried to understand their strategy and their move.. I'm not an expert in finance, I don't understand the specifics, I use my logics, I just try to understand whats going on, be free to correct me and put your insight, I think it's a great exercise.   \-Early January, GME and AMC are in a very bad situation so they bet that their stock whould go down.  \-Mid-late January some Ape from reddits decide to push these stock to the moon. So Hedge funds can't close their shorts for a certain time. The more time they wait, more fee and interest they have to pay.   \-The goal of these amazing ape is to bleed the hedge fund.  \-After  the little squeeze, the hedge funds claim that they lost billions $$$. This is where I become sceptical. What if they didnt lose that much money, how much money can they really lose in a few day for not closing shorts? We always say that we don't lose money until we sell our stock at lost, it's probably the same thing for hedge funds, no? They probably lost money, but billions seems a bit far fetch, no?  So, maybe they are trying to give us a small victory, a fake victory for the cause.  \-This week, a lot of stock have lost momentum, their goal is to close their shorts fast. They want to close for 2 reasons, they are losing money and on the 9th of february there's a report they will tell, that they didnt close their shorts.  If that report says that the hedge fund didnt close their shorts, it's very probable it will trigger another squeeze.    \-Hedge funds have 2 advantages over us: they have knowledge of their true position and they can buy/sell during after hour.  \-So if I was the Hedge funds, this week Iwould use every dirty trick I know to crash the stock, short ladder, media manipulation, etc. During the weekend or monday, I close most of my shorts and right before the report is release, they buy a tons of stock of GME and AMC. Not only they can close their shorts at like 6$ instead of 18$ for AMC, but they can make money from the squeeze. With that strategy they could break even and maybe even make a bit of money! ? This way, it's a win-win situation everybody makes money.  What do you think? Does it make sense? And you if you were the hedge funds what strategy would you use?
Gamestop Gains.
Discussion Question: When the squeeze is squoze, how many trading days do you anonymous apes and retards (who are not providing financial advice) think the rapid rise will last? And which day will have the highest intraday spike?
VW had two full days of rapid rise and four days of gains. It hit its super high intraday on day 2 but finished the day much lower than the peak. Its action began either after hours on Friday or early hours on Monday (I can't tell from the chart) but there was distinct extended hours movement between the days. It finished up four four straight days but never approached its intraday super high on Day 2 (Tuesday).  There are a lot of contracts to unwind with GME once it goes. In your anonymous internet opinions and knowing that apes and retards cannot give financial advice, any thoughts?
Point of Clarity: The Volkswagen short of 2008 took AN ENTIRE MONTH TO PEAK
Robinhood removed position limits on AMC and GME
Little too late if you ask me, fuck you Vlad you Dollar store Keanu Reeves looking motherfucker🖕
UMWC   they just reported 800% more profit from 4Q last year and went down 10% today after this great news they are shorting this stock to get it for cheap as possible get this stock to the moon like it deserves

Where’s DFV’s post today ?
I'm new here but I want to say something. All you    just be quiet and do what you do. All the     keep holding! If you couldn't lose it you shouldn't invest it! To the fucking    🌖🌖🌖
For real all these people trying to persuade you to sell fuck that. You didn't give a shit what they said when you bought. They didn't push the button for you did they? No so you gonna let them push the sell button?   If you can't afford to lose you're doing it wrong. Maybe you should keep your soft ass    away from that abrasive buy button in the first place.   For the rest of you retarded     let's see this shit to moon      It's just money don't act like you can't make more. This shit is worth the price of admission anyways.    Not financial advice just the thoughts of a retarded ape that likes stocks.

Citadel HOLD Loss >200%
A few days ago I looked for the most shorted stocks in Europe.     I found a short position of almost 2 years of citadel. The stock in question in a short time has gained a lot. But citadel does not cut its losses.                    They are also retarded. I bet the short on GME >200%.      Do you think they sold at a loss? No. Melvin was loaned money to keep the shorts open. Point72 boss laughs like crazy reading our comments. They are all short. My advice is to hold the stock.   In my opinion the drop is due to the new reddit users who bought but have no experience so they sold to limit their losses. Their behavior made the quotations fall. I've been saying since last thursday that this game will last 2-3 weeks. Hold!     In Europe they have to report immediately to the supervisors when they exceed   and then they have to report the same day if they change the short position by       Conflict of interest:  I have 400 GAMESTOP shares and tomorrow I buy another 500.
What stocks are y'all looking at other than gme/amc
I'm still holding! Diamond hands bitch    down over -1500. But what are some other stocks you're looking at? Imma need to gain some $ back from gme
Buy it up apes!
Not sure who needs to see this...
But stop blaming your GME losses on Jim Cramer, Robinhood, the SEC, short ladders, whatever else...  Complaints about the above can be broken down to this:  1) Cramer and the rest of the news media are in the business of getting eyeballs. Not helping people invest or make money. GME/AMC/whatever else was the hot story so they ran it. Their “advice” is a facade.   2) Robinhood shut down trading in GME and other meme stocks because it became a victim of its own success. They didnt have enough cash to support your trades so they stopped trading. You trusted a startup to handle your investing and you paid the price. Honestly I think you should be grateful they didnt let you buy more at $300/sh. But I realize im arguing with retards here.  3) The SEC is looking into WSB because they think that hedge funds supported and profited off the GME hype. They dont care about your five shares and    memes. Honestly just take one minute and look at the stock chart, are you really surprised the SEC is investigating who might have manipulated the stock UP rather than back down to earth. Get a grip on reality.  4) Short ladders aren’t real and even if they were, they’d only work if there isn’t real investor demand for the stock. And we all know there isnt an iota of real demand at >$50. If the stock was actually worth $1,000 then it would trade at $1,000. Piling into a stock to push a short squeeze is just the inverse so take a look in the mirror and don’t act like you are so righteous. Just like how a short squeeze doesn’t last forever, neither would a ladder. Its clear now which side is “right.”  If you lost money on GME its because you got sucked into the hype or got greedy. Perhaps you took a virtuous route and saw a community that tried to take down a bunch of hedge funds.  And lets be honest. You won! But very briefly. Melvin’s image will be forever tarnished by this and Wall Street now has to respect the little guys. But this came at the cost of many small investors who might have lost all they had saved up.  You can hold your shares all you want, but maybe take a hard look at who’s really at fault. No one forced you to double down on GME at $100.
We might hit $90 tomorrow
Close to doubling!
OH well would you look at that!
Y'all gonna be sorry when it skyrockets in a 42069 years
Watch.
1K to 150K. This is my smallest gain between 3 accounts on $GME.
A Reddit (not me) vagabond came across this today. If it's true. He'll get monies.

No one knows jack about shit!!
Honestly, im a newbie here and I won’t even start to pretend that I know anything about the stock market. Ive been glued to this sub for a week now and have been reading most of the DD posts. And honestly, most of it were purely speculation. They were really compelling and most of it made sense (to a degree) so that I myself bought into it when it was at 80$, averaged UP a lot (i know im a retard), missed the exit point when it was at the top and now Im holding the bag as a reminder to at least take out some cash when its going good. But thats just a side note.   All of you belittling the holders, such as myself, don’t pretend that you know what’s gonna happen next. Bc your guess is as good as anyones. You have as little information as the rest of us. We all might know whats likely to happen but you don’t run up into a casino and laugh at a guy who goes all in on a number on the roulette table. ITS A GODDAM BET. And yes, the odds of this thing going to the moon are not very good. But it could be still possible. (Don’t ask me how or why, I don’t know jack shit, remember?) So how about you take a step back and let the people who have still skin in the game gamble? If you have more skin in this than you can afford get out and get help. Seriously. But the rest of us. Fuck it ill be going through this hellhole right now just to see if there’s maybe a rocketship waiting for us after all to yeet us right up to the moon and   not. Well it’ll be the same situation as it is now, most of the money is gone anyways. Imagine texas holdem. The price to see the next card is already paid. So you might aswell stick around to actually see the next card.
Sauron Mt Doom Fundamental Spotted
I don't think it's a good idea to buy more GME stocks at this point
Hear me out. Not financial advice but I think it's time to let the GME stonk free fall. There's no point of keep buying because it will keep dropping no matter what.   But I believe to keep HOLDING on what you have, and see how low the HFs can get the stonks to. At some point below @20, it may attract others (who have made profits from this) as well as us can buy a lot more to pump it up again because the HFs will start covering their positions in bulks. They won't be able to cover all shares because our  🤌🏻 but that's the lost the HFs can afford.   Again it's not financial advice, just something come out from my smooth brain.
Bought 20 shares   there is still hope, November 9th is around the corner
Do you financial wizards realize gme gonig from 5 to 500 is a 9900% return?
hedgefund managers would give their first born and their left nut for a 20 % year over year stable return.     and you autists arent happy with making 9900% in a span of a week.     theres nothing to hold you've already gone to the stratosphere and beyond.     YOU WON. the problem is robinshithood ran out of money to pay up, yes technically you could have gone to infinity and crashed the entire stock market.      but they cheated and it didnt happen.      anyways thats the truth of the matter. invest safe, and don't fall for people trying to make you a bagholder.
What is with all of the disclaimers?
It seems like the most popular posts on this sub the last few days have all been accompanied by a "this is not advice" or "this is just my opinion" statement preceding the post or at the very end. Are people doing this to cover their ass so they can shitpost? Could there really be legal action over a Reddit post?
Simple Questions Reveal the Obvious Deceptions
If everything  they  say is true, then it is truly over, and we lost. But if that's the case, then    Why have they not stopped the short ladder attacks?   Why are they still incessantly spewing out articles spelling our doom?   Why are GME and AMC's graphs so closely correlated?  From my layman's perspective, there is only one answer that satisfies all three questions:  IT'S NOT OVER. They're not just manipulating the market. They're manipulating you.  We're still in this fight. If we lose, it will only be because they convinced us to give up. I will Diamond Hand this thing to the very end. I hope you will too.
At least I’ve lost only two years of my IRA
The Difference between GME and AMC
AMC never got to an unrealistic price. GME was a great squeeze and you should hold to prove a point but let’s face it, it will never get back to $200 or $400. My opinion at least. Open to discussion. But AMC never got to that point, unfortunately for most of us but there is definitely still something fishy going on if you notice their charts. Stay vigilant and hold apes.
They have taken our tendies and used our ass for dipping sauce. Spicy buffalo sting will remind me to never give up.
Next time try ranch.
The point of stocks is to gamble and try to make money
This is obvious, but I feel like many new people aren't understanding this.  Each portion of the phrase is important.  # Gamble  Stocks are a gamble.  If you lose, it's not because there's a deep state conspiracy to keep the man down.  It's because losing is something that happens quite often when you gamble.  You don't walk into a casino and complain that the system is rigged for the house to win.  That's obvious.  If you don't like that, then don't gamble at a casino.  # Try to make money  The point of stocks is to make money.  Makes sense, right?  So if you're buying stocks for other reasons, consider that there might be cheaper alternatives.  For example,  ## Sticking it to the man  You can volunteer for political   or attend protests for free, and those are probably a much more effective methods of trying to combat the increasing wealth gap.  When you gamble in the stock market, you're more likely to make the rich richer than the other way around.  ## Sense of belonging  You can actually make memes and participate in communities for free on reddit.  Buying stock is not required.  ## Holding something that makes you feel good  Perhaps a teddy bear or a weighted blanket would be a cheaper and more tangible option.
Noticed something interesting about the potential Reddit and Discord bots
Disclaimer: I am relatively new to WSB myself so my observations are in no way reflective of the community as a whole or anything like that.  So as the title implies, I've noticed an interesting trend with some of the posts and comments being made on WSB, other investing subreddits, and the various Discord communities out there. It seems that all of the paper handed bitches telling everyone $GME, $AMC, or other 'meme stocks' are dead seem to only really come out during market open. Inversely, during after hours or market close, it would seem the majority of posts and comments propose a much more positive outlook on these stocks and are genuinely helpful and bot-free so to speak.  Now if you are to assume that the hedgies or other institutions (like I do) are behind the shills and bots then it would only make sense that they would be active during trading hours. That's when they would make the most impact trying to get people to sell and give up hope right? Why would they care what we talk about when we can't make moves?  You can pretty easily see what I mean if you scroll through 'new' now compared to say noon. Because right now I see a lot of people spreading positivity, talking about long-term prospects, and the like. Even the people right now who are talking about selling or bag holding are at least doing so in a way that's backed up by an explanation. Compare this to what it's like after the bell rings and all you see is suspicious accounts giving radical advice sometimes even without any context at all.  I don't know. I guess I'm just trying to explain and vent how I feel about this ridiculously weird situation so I don't go completely crazy this week.
I don't blame yall.
With 7 million new people here I can't blame yall for not knowing what this sub is for. This is a place where we respect the loser more than the winners. This is a place where you put your life savings and your family's on the line because a magic 8 ball told you to go for it. This is the place where RETARDS go to invest. Not fancy schmancy people that wear suits to do the same thing i do in my tidey whiteys. If your wife, girlfriend or their boyfriends don't get mad at you for your trades, then guess what ? You don't belong here . This is wallsteeet "bets" not wallstreet "safe investments that give a yearly compounding interest return of .02%"

Its a win win, hole the line!!!

how can i buy gme from mexico
anyone from mexico knows an app like robinhood that i can use from mexico? wanna get some gme
If you feel stupid: Albania literally had a civil war in 1997 because the entire country got caught up in multiple pyramid schemes.

There is an insane amount of people coming for blood for those who held gme today.
There wasnt a peep from them when it hit 400 to sell but now when its low they are like i told you so. Well no you didnt, you sold at top and felt attacked when ppl called you paper hands so now you are shit-commenting and driving morale down like the selfish apes you are.
How can the SEC investigate WSB for manipulation when everything is in the open???
I mean isn't the whole point of manipulation is to conspire in secrecy with a select few so that others never know what is happening and can never react? I dont see how whats happening in WSB can be called manipulation when its out in the open and everyone has an equal chance to learn about it and react accordingly. I think the hedge funds overlooked the threat to their reckless short bets and just got squeezed. Fair and square!
The idea of buying & holding GME to stick to the “big guys” is bizarre
First of all, I’m truly sorry for all those who recently lost money in trading the so-called meme stocks. While some people may find other people’s financial loss somewhat entertaining, I want to emphasize behind every “loss porn”, stood a real person. I hope everyone who lost recently will find better luck in the future and know that at end of the day, you can always make these money back so long you are healthy and alive!   That said, the group think that had led up to the bubble and burst of meme stocks (in particular, GME) has left me baffled about the deceptive nature that has motivated people into holding a clearly losing position.  “Sunken Cost” fallacy aside, the idea that if you keep buying or holding stocks like GME will make the rich bleed is frankly bizarre. Sure, some big player like Melvin capital got burned, but please understand that they aren’t the only player or HF in Wall Street (on the contrast, they are more akin to a small fish in a big sea). In reality, a lot of HFs don’t profit from directional trades (long or short a stock), but rather, profits are made from longing or shorting the stock’s Volatility (hence why more HFs actually made a killing from their Straddle positions - feel free to look up what that means). Trying to convince other people to dump their life savings into a volatile play like GME with the argument that it’ll help bankrupt the rich cannot be further from the truth.   I know I’ll get downvoted for saying this but I’m just shattered from seeing people losing their life savings while believing this is somehow doing a good deed. I pray that a miracle happens and GME will bounce back soon on a catalyst so at least those who lost everything can get a chance to recover. But please, before the meaningless shills, do some research about the basics of how hedge funds work and the economy in general before convincing others that it’s ok to lose money in a gamble like this.   Good luck to all!
50/50 Sell/hold rating on RH, curious where that bit comes from. (Still holding GME, AMC)
Down $10K.    ?
In what world does a stock price go down when we've been buying like crazy? (GME,AMC,BB,NOKIA,ETC)
It's clear that there's market manipulation, fake news and bots spamming bullshit to kill morale. But seriously, what can we do to overcome this?
If $GME ever ends, we really ought to get a diamond hands badge or something. This got more worldwide attention than anything else that has ever happened on Reddit.
I have no idea who it should go to.  The OG WSBs?  I don't want to exclude the newer retards.  Some of them have the diamondest of hands.  Just the people that held?  How would we ever figure that out?  Sort this out and tag /u/spez until he makes it happen  :)
Does RH freeze your entire account when you do a partial transfer?
I'm thinking of transferring some of my shares to fidelity but can't afford to have all my hedges that I'm leaving in RH frozen in the meantime.
I’m betting on GOEV
I’m pretty excited about GOEV. They are talking with apple about building the new apple car. It’s a relatively new startup that just went public.  They have a plant capable of building their cars in the   This is very important to apple.   Apple also gave them an offer to either buy a large stake in the company or to become investors. This was in December 2020 so that could very well be a possibility.  Apple has never wanted to work with Tesla, and likely won’t. They want to build a new, more affordable EV from the floor up. Tesla is obviously the king, but excluding them, who else is even in the competition. GOEVS EV design set them apart.   I would love to hear what you think about GOEV.   I have 20 shares and a 2/19 20c.

AMC Gamma Squeeze
I know just enough to be dangerous as I am a smooth brained retard. However, my wife's boyfriend was saying that Calls and sold Puts that finish ITM will create a gamma squeeze. As they are exercised the number of shares being swept off the table should force significant upward momentum. Can anyone elaborate on how this effect works and how we can capitalize?   I feel that's why it has been forced down so drastically going into tomorrow to try and get these thousands of options to expire worthless.   's and  's and what not  Edit 1: For a Gamma Squeeze to happen it sounds like the price would have to get up to the 20's by the closing bell to ensure enough contracts trigger.  C'est La Vie  Edit 2: Right now   million shares will finish in the money for Call Options. If by the end of the day the share price ends above 9 dollars than that puts an additional   million shares from Call Options totaling   shares purchased... I'm not saying that wouldn't create movement... but... maybe  Edit 3: This has an incredible amount of volume compared to GME it is not even close!!

Robinshit position limits on GME removed
Looks like Robinhood was able to meet their clearinghouse requirements today and they’ve removed restrictions on buying GME and AMC finally TO THE MOON WE GO     This is the time for us to buy more than 1 pathetic share at a time. This is the time we can finally increase our exposure to the upside. This is the time we take control back from the HFs and snarl their short ladder attacks   We can finally push back against those who have been manipulating the price and show them that GME belongs on the     GME
Let some contracts execute on Friday out of spite to robinhood for not letting me buy. Fuck it. I like the stock.
You could just buy puts you idiots
Stop fucking not hedging your positions. I'm up 54k from dick riding gameboy up and back down. I did this with minimal effort it literally was like 12 button presses over a week.   What the fuck guys are we here to make money or play make believe. Literally you could have as much or more than me and throw it right back into your gameboys if you want. I've learned that this is highschool and though occasionally you succeed going against the grain, the easiest way to fuck someone at prom is to just go with the flow. Keeping it to the highschool analogy, you're acting a lot like the anime club WSB.   edit  this isn't to discourage anyone. I love seeing so many people curious about white knuckle investing. Just know that there are ways you can make money on stocks regardless of their direction. You don't have to just get fucked when something goes wrong   Calls rolled into puts when it went bad . I took out 16 to pay off my debts.
Forget a movement regarding a stock. Let's start a movement to get everyone out of Robinhood. If for whatever horrible reason you are still using it, gtfo
Restictions Lifted on GME, etc.
If your holding now you're just holding the bag for hedge funds
If you're holding now you're just holding the bag for hedge funds. The problem with the idea of gme is that if we all hold the price will continue to rise. The problem is not paper hands who sell, the problem is hedge funds and other firms who own millions of shares of gme. We are not in control and the truth is we were never in control. Its likely these hedge funds will continue to sell off their shares, when you hold you're not sticking it to the big guy, you're helping the big guy by holding the bag for them.
Dear Ryan Cohen, We are holding for you!
Man, disinformation is a helluva drug. 5 million users flooding the WSB. CNBC pumping info. HF's doing what HF's do.  Nobody wants to discuss the future of GameStop. They only want the casino action and some immediate gratification. Most of us (I hope) are able to hang lose on GME and AMC. GME in particular has some future with Ryan Cohen and his experience with Chewy (which I love BTW)  Stonks are mostly LONG bets. GME will rise. It may be slowly, it may be painful, but you only have losses IF YOU SELL! Many of you are young and dicking with your 401k's with plenty of time to recoup any loss. Just close the browser on GME and go have a frosty beverage. Let your limit sells until cancelled sit idle until GME hits 10K!!!! ~ or a more realistic $375'ish depending on your pain threshold.  I personally am holding for Ryan Cohens vision. From my first Commodore 64 game purchased at Babbage's to the XBOX360 sold for $  at GameStop. I'm anxious to see what comes. And I'm down 35K so I got that going for me.  Hit me up Ryan. Love to be your right hand man for Cyber Network Defense
Salute to all the holders
It’s getting tough bois, I am holding as well and really questioning it rn tho 😩 stay strong everyone I hope we pull through.
$GME Holders In Crisis
Mark Cuban said "once the brokerage stops restricting trades, then we'll see what WSB is really made of". Well, guess what? Robinhood has removed all restrictions.
Let's show them what we're made of: retards.
I noticed GME falls at a consistent rate recently, is this normal?
No more limits! Time to get back to the moon!!!      🤚
Exuberance, to euphoria, to denial, to losing 1mil in tendies
Something don’t seem right
If the GME squeeze already happened last week like I see a lot of people commenting then why the need for all the manipulation/tactics early this week?   Friday we closed at 325 with sentiment strong as fuck and then all of a sudden on Monday, over a weekend where we saw people put up billboards spreading awareness of the GME movement across the country, we suddenly drop $100 on barely any volume? That don’t seem right at all. It’s gotta be some kind of short ladder attack or some type of hedgie fuckery my retard brain can’t quite comprehend.   But what I do understand is that this whole situation smells fishy as all fuck. If the shorts covered then they would be clear of this whole thing. What is the point of having all these bot accounts spread negative sentiment in the threads? What is the point of continuing to have robinhood/other brokerages restrict buying?   If this was really over they would have washed their hands of this whole situation and moved on to their next scheme.   But I don’t think it’s over.   I think the hedgies still have significant short positions that need to be covered and us    apes of the retard alliance won’t sell them our shares. Remember, as long as the shorts have shares they need to buy back and our autistic asses keep buying and holding the available shares, at some point they will need to pay our asking price, no matter how retarded it is.  Wait until the short interest report next week at least and let’s see what the true situation is but my instinct is that Melvin and his hedgie circle jerk buddies are still fuck.   REMEMBER WHY YOU STARTED THIS FIGHT.  Yes, money is good but I am in this because I saw this as a once in a lifetime opportunity to FUCK THE SYSTEM, the same system that has FUCKED US ALL OVER FOR DECADES. Best of all, I can do this from the comfort of my home sitting on my ass without having to do a thing but hold my shares.  MY RETARDED BROTHERS HOLD STRONG AND DO NOT LOSE YOUR CONVICTION.  THIS WAR IS FAR FROM OVER AND I REFUSE TO LOSE IT. I AM THAT STUBBORN AND I AM THAT RETARDED. WHO IS WITH ME!
a movie about this fiasco would be literally the most stupid fuck thing done in the history of mankind
I mean people would die from cringing. It’s dumber than my decision the gamecockstock at 90 bones. I swear to sweet baby Jesus, I would rather lick glass shards off an Indonesian sweatshop floor than watch something as putrid as the rumored “movie”

The good of it all
This week I bought into in both Gamestop and AMC movie theaters. It was a gamble on a longshot and I looked at it as a gamble and not an investment. I didn't put in a lot, no more than I could afford to lose. As of now I've lost, maybe it's over, maybe it's not. What I have left is sitting there waiting to see. I'm not worried, it's been fun, it's been exciting, hell probably the most excitement I've had since this whole lockdown crap.   I've learned a lot, not so much about stocks but about people. I've learned that theres people on both sides of things that just want to rag on someone who's worse off than they are. I guess it makes them feel superior. I don't let them get to me. In fact I feel bad for them. It must suck to be that unhappy.  I learned that a common enemy really does bring people together. In hopes of fighting the dishonesty wall street. I saw people or all races, ethnicities, orientations, and political & social views come together. It was an American thing in the start but when it seemed the shorters were winning I saw people from Austria, Germany, Canada, Korea Japan, New Zeland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and more not only give words of support but their money to keep things going.  I saw good things happen, I saw a 15 year old kid take his 3k and make 250k and pull his profit to pay for college. I saw a 10 year old kid get rich from a gift his mom gave him years ago. I saw a man find out his dog needed life saving surgery and because of his profit he could do it. I saw a guy donate nintindo switches (a lot of them) to St Judes. I saw someone buy tendie lunches for all the workers at Gillette childrens healthcare.  I saw a CEO donate it all to a charity for small businesses. I saw so many reports of good things! People helping people with their winnings.  Was it worth it even if I never recoup my money? Hell yes! It's great to see so many people come together despite their differences. To see so many good things come out of it. Were there greedy people involved, sure. Were there some who stepped on others, sure. Happens everywhere, but it's not always balanced with the good. It's nice to be reminded of the good.  Oh and I'm holding! Diamond Hands till death!!     TL;DR - Win or lose it's been a good experience
God please give me something other than GME
I get it, big hype and fun and memes, I enjoyed it too. But seriously every post is GME, the DD section is all GME. This “I’m holding for the cause” is ridiculous. Would you keep hitting till you bust at blackjack because “it’s about sending a message”? I just want to read DD and laugh at memes of something other than GME. We are not a movement, were gambling
What are the odds of Disney acquiring AMC?
Seems to make sense if the numbers work out — Disney could vertically integrate its operations in the movie space, owning both the development and distribution to end-customers while potentially even upgrading its theatres to mini Disney parks. Folks would love it
the hedge funds conveniently covered their shorts when buying was shut off
if this hadn't have happened, people wouldn't have been confused about whether they covered the shorts. it's quite obvious now, that a lot of people weren't sure if shorts had been covered because of the buying being shut off, but clearly that's when they covered when they got a chance to when the price tanked to $100. none of the retail could buy, but it still rebounded from 100-400, and that's probably when they covered.   so let's be clear here, they took advantage of the fault in the system (conveniently), and got away with it.    and because most of us never knew that could happen, we lost track of whether the squeeze had happened yet or not. they engineered the perfect condition for them to cover their shorts, even if they were already starting to cover on the way up to $500 (which is partly why it went to 500), they would've had to cover even higher (up to $1000 probably)   if buying wasn't shut off for everyone (majority of retail, the ones squeezing them) except for them.
I feel I would be a POS if I didn't say this
Hey folks, First of all, if you are going to downvote me because I am not saying "buy GME and Hold" you can eat my ass. I could give a shit about karma. That said, here is my advice, take it or leave it.  First of all, I like trading stocks, and I like making easy money even more, but I also know that people that make money in the stock market are shrewd and pragmatic (think Cuban and Burry). But PLEASE FFS DO NOT DUMP your tuition money, life savings, rent, insulin money or whatever important thing you are jeopardizing by buying into this stock now. Treat it like Vegas, only play with money you are okay losing.  NOW:A wise man once said of the money you can invest, keep 40% in cash and never put more than 15% in one single trade, that's how you keep from blowing up your account.  Lastly fuck Robinhood, stop using them, switch to a broker that won't fuck you. Otherwise, I hope everyone reading this gets filthy rich and as Zach says "fuck the g-ride, I want the machines that are making them!"    let me save many of you posts: I will certainly try hard to NOT cut Melvins dick with my paper hands because I am undoubtedly sucking it.

How to Cope
Hello, everyone. I know it's a difficult time for you all, whether you're stressed out that your +1000% will drop in an instant to -500% or if your account is -500% to -50000%. Let's remember that there's always that prime coping mechanism we can always utilize to our advantage:  Jacking off.   Yes, jacking off.   Even though the house is burning all around us, our friends have left us to die, our neighbors look strangely at us as if we're delusional.   Just jack off  .   3 times a day is not enough, sometimes. You need to take it up several notches during these dark, dark times. The refractory period? Well, during those restful refractory periods, don't even look at stock charts or trading info. Just do something productive. And when you think you're ready to nut again, pull out your phone, go to your favorite website and your favorite personal private place and give yourself the high of your life. It's not that hard and without even knowing it, some of you are already skilled at it.   In order to maximize the pleasure of jacking off, for me, I have three rules:  1. Variation -- jack off to different things in different sessions. Just like people get bored with a game they're good at, people won't get as hard to similar things. Try new flavors, new smells. 2. Diet and exercise -- in order to maximize the volume of the nut, one must ensure that their diet supports the necessary ingredients for the nut. Boost your vitamin and mineral intake (as to which specific ones, just google it). Exercise builds testosterone, which ultimately   up the production of your white cream.  3. Get some damn sleep -- I know some of you retards don't get sleep nowadays because a nuclear bomb had been dropped on your account, or your rocket ship fell back to earth. But this is important in having a good state of mind and a good nut.   Depending on the size of your dong, you'll either have what we call a "long squeeze" or for most people, "a short squeeze".   Regardless of the security you hold, regardless of your background, regardless of your birthrights--if any--your physiology will always be here for you. It will be with you in the hardest times, the best times. And for stock trading, nutting has helped me cope through the periods of intensity during the glory days of TSLA, SPY 0 days til' expiry, NIO, PLTR, and now GME.   Just let it all out.

Listen up.
There is no doubt there was a sell off by some of us today. The volume correlates with that. I genuinely feel for those of you who risked it all on GME.   One thing I’d like to mention is the Hedges have undoubtedly thrown every piece of arsenal they have in our direction. The final piece that will end this war is turning us all on each other. That’s what I’m currently seeing. I’m sure it’s funny for the lurkers to look at the loss porn. It must feel great to say “I told you so”. No one really cares.  Whether the squeeze has been squoze or not is irrelevant to me personally. (I don’t think it has).  I will hold my shares until I’m dead.   GME TO THE FUCKING MOON.     🏻💀
Squeezing before Feb 9.
Not financial advice, I'm retarded.   Alright listen up. The squeeze is either happening on or before the 9th, or not at all. On the 9th, Nasdaq short interest data gets updated after market close. This will tell us whether all these places reporting decreases in short interest like S3 are reporting false data or not.  If they are, the plan drafted up by them and whoever paid them off probably goes like this: S3 publishes fake data to drive down retail interest while ladder attacks and share buying limits work to dump the share price. If the Nasdaq data shows there still is high short interest, at least for the days S3 reported on, it would contradict S3 and make them out to be implicit in manipulation. Considering they want to remain a business in the future, they would only agree to this if short sellers made them look right in the end. This would give us our first signal that the squeeze is coming, S3 suddenly starts reporting upticks in short interest just before the 9th. Shorts would then work to drive the price into the ground to their desired price while lining this up with S3 reporting "gradual" short interest increases, which is easy thanks to these daily ladder attacks.   If they aren't, then there is no squeeze, and everyone here should take to the streets to protest the SEC for failing to protect retail investors.  At this point, the ladder is working. GME hype is six feet underground. But, considering short sellers are the greediest form of human filth on the planet, it's not impossible for them to do what I've outlined above, especially if the interest on these shorts is pennies compared to what they'll make if the price stays low. Keep an eye on how places like S3 start reporting data in the days leading up to the 9th, that'll be the signal.
Please Read: To everyone that needs to move forward
I know many of us were counting on GME going to the moon. But it didn’t. And that’s ok. Stocks go up and they go down. That’s the game. And i’m not saying it’s over. We never know what can happen from here on out. But like Mark Cuban said, the next time we do go head to head with Wall Street, we’ll be prepared and we won’t go in blind. Despite the fact that I personally, have lost  career ending amounts of money, i’m not upset. If anything, this was an amazing learning experience, and i’m proud to of gotten to be apart of this movement. In the span of one week, i’ve made both enough money to set me for life, and lost enough to rethink the next steps in my life. I know many people in this community are looking for some sort of confirmation bias. They want someone to tell them that the thousands of dollars they lost weren’t for nothing. That if they just wait one more week they’ll make all of it back. Even though I won’t be selling anytime soon, I have accepted the reality that there is a chance GME will not return to its formal glory. I’m sorry if you were left behind holding the bag. I am among one of those people. But that’s life and by no means is this over. We will return. And when we do, we will be stronger than ever.       500 @130

IS GME DEAD?
Im currently holding onto 10 shit shares at about 143 cad each, is there any hope? Told myself i would have to sell if it went below 50 which it did after hours. Should I sell or am I destined to be a bag holder?
Firehose of falsehood
I don’t usually post just comment because my DD is shit and usually rely on r/investing for stock picks. I’ve been part of WSB for some time now (MSFT 180 /spy 300 gang bang) I have never seen this amount of shaming and ridiculing for holding a stock or call. We always had each other’s back‘s always pushed each other up even if we knew our calls were at .01 (still buying those FDs baby) so what I’m trying to say is right now GME’s Price is causing me anus to collapse and all these negative posts and abusive comments on the weekly discussion or posts is probably Being pumped by someone with interest in having the stock go down and those fucking cocksuckers are playing psychological warfare with you in order to recoup their losses and if anyone makes you feel like shit because you lost money or you’re holding tell them to go fuck their mothers. If you want to sell or hold that’s purely up to you just because someone makes you feel like shit shouldn’t be a factor in your reasoning. They’re gaslighting your trauma they’re pumping you and discouraging you with bad information to make you feel like shit and if these assholes continue this shit someone is going to get hurt and that needs to stop.

It really wouldn’t be that hard for GME...
To revolutionize the gaming industry by simply bringing back what we all want, to rent the latest games to hit the market, and in all reality, how hard would it be for GME to become the biggest online digital rental gaming platform in the world? I used to remember going to blockbuster and renting games so I wouldn’t have to buy them, or have different tier rental packages which enables you to beta test, weekend packages, weekly/monthly rental packages, kinda like the Netflix of online game rentals, plus access to all classics at anytime with a paid subscription. It’s really not that hard. You don’t need all the brick and mortars, but some here and there to handle platform sales and hard copy sales.  Any thoughts?

New Guy - Opinion Post (don’t hate me) and investment talk
New Guy  Lurker for a decade, formally joined/downloaded the mobile  app a month   fear the media attention will require that I do even more DD on every person posting in the future which is sad. Anyways, that’s all. If anyone has tips on how to easily see who to trust or not I’d love to be able to filter out the noise. Best of luck to the GME holders and the rest of you. 👊🏼   ⚽️ On a lighter note. I put out a call yesterday on Visa that is doing well, curious if anyone has opinions on how long to hold. (Edit: expiration is in just 1 month)  🤘🏼Also started recurring investments on SQ and PYPL to hedge success (or failure) or electronic money, as I feel they’re poised well either way.    👍🏼Lastly, I have a sneaking suspicion we could all do well riding PENN and DKNG up up up. I am heavy into DKNG right now but I feel like the PENN guys have a stranglehold on their market with all of the chads and bros out there (free advertising every day through barstool social media) Open to feedback!
$CRSR will post blowout earnings on 2/9. Load the fuck up
Don’t let greed and fear make you disregard facts
If we all hold we all win.
Why HOLDing matters for GameStop
Hold. Hold. Hold. If you got 1 share or 1000 shares. It just doesnt matter. Just hold.   There is only   shares available for purchase. Last we knew short interest was over 122 percent per finviz.   Short interest information is out 2/9. All the short interest shit you’ve seen on companies such as S3 and onyx is their prediction. It could be true or as bad as throwing darts blind folded.     One thing for sure is that the shorts are still fighting. Bots posting, DTCC still limiting shares, media still shilling how we’re defeated, etc. We should continue to fight. Hold your shares.  Dont sell for a loss. Average down if you can. You bought 100 shares at 250? Buy another 100 shares and lower your cost average to 150 per share if you bought your second batch at 50. Doing this will remove available shares from the pool. Keep averaging down and if you eventually want to get out, then it’ll be easier than having to stomach 250/share cost basis.   Ryan Cohen is GameStop’s Elon Musk. Also fuck paper hand Portney. He’s loaded and didn’t need to sell so fuck him. Ryan Cohen is bringing GME from shitty B&M to favorite place to buy games/hardware/other shit. He brought in some amazon dude as well. Enough said.   Still thinking about selling for a fucking loss? You a small ass paper handing bitch. Mama didn’t raise a bitch. Wait it out. Put in new money and use that. Leave your GameStop shares alone and wait for the next catalyst.   Lastly, GameStop was destined to rocket to the moon. We were cheated when Robinhood restricted shares. We were spat on when GameStop price plummeted and Robinhood said you can now buy 500 shares. Fuck you Robinhood. I’m moving my money to Fidelity.
Losing Never Felt This Good
My Dudes,  This last week has been quite the fuckin experience.  I have never traded before in my entire life until this absolute shit show of a meme rocked the planet. My buddies meme'd the Diamond Hands and Holding the Line and Ape Banana Split Sundaes with the Stonk Sprinkles until I cracked and got started.   I'm not going to recap the events of the last week as it will be forever written in the history books, but I am kicking myself for not dipping my balls in the Market. This shit is fucking awesome! I, too, did not want my memes to be dreams. With AMC and GME, we are most likely fucked and I honestly don't give a rat's ass, bois. I wipe my ass with the paper-handed fucks that jumped in for some quick gains and couldn't see the forest from the trees.   Wake the fuck up, hunker the fuck down, and enjoy the wild ride. I love this shit and I am not going fuckin anywhere.  Firm handshakes all around and may all your buys make you yuge fuckin profits. Fuck the Moon. I'll see you fucks on Mars.
Just to be clear. $GME shorts weren’t squeezed. We got conned.
Instead of squeezing the shorts, WSB pumped the stock and then dumped it on the new comers who joined the WSB Reddit, saw that the squeeze was being contemplate, and decided to join in, thinking this was for real.  This was never about the squeeze; this was always about the pimp and dump.   Melvin panicked too soon and that’s why they got half squeezed. Other shorts shorted at the top and then drove the price down and made a fortune.   This was not a squeeze. This was a scam. Don’t ever fall for it again.
Project Veritas has a Wall street insider
Apparently a wall street insider has contacted Project Veritas, It will be interesting how this will make the markets move?
The “diamond hands” culture here is seriously fucking so dumb
I’ve seen way too many posts these last few weeks of people on fucked up amounts of gains screaming “IM NOT SELLING, DIAMOND HANDS”.  Then next minute the same dumb fuck has lost it all.  Some person just posted they went from $35k to $5m then back down to $300k and they’re still not selling.  Literally hurts my head how dumb some of you are. The whole retard thing use to be a bit of a gag here, now there’s ACTUAL retards here.  Learn to cash out you dumb fucks
Yahoo has a article about wallstreetbets and sndl
They said it was being targeted next and sec is watching. But I don't see any talk here about it   Not financial advice

Just getting into stocks?
OK so for those of you that are getting into stocks like I was a few weeks back or want to know trading patterns I would use   Or if you have any suggestions/improvements from what I've learned I would be happy to discuss down below.  When you are investigating whether or not a stock is a buy you want to look at two things the RSI and the MACD  The RSI is the 'Relative strength index' and is on a scale from 1-100 with horizontal lines going from the 30 and 70 mark these lines indicates whether the stock is overbought(70) and oversold(30). If you see a stock at an RSI of 77 there is a likely chance that it will go down vice verses with an RSI of 33 where the price will likely go up. Then there are instances of stocks that fluctuate in between the 30 and 70 lines, those are called floats. For the most part that is what is depicted in chart the top of the chart.  Secondly, you want to look at the MACD graph(on the bottom of the chart). This stands for 'Moving average convergence/divergence'. As this one is a bit more confusing I won't go into a lot of depth. However, you will notice 2 lines, one red and one black. The black line is the MACD line and is calculated by the 12th day exponential moving average minus the 26th day exponential moving average. It basically just tells you whether the graph is moving up, down, or sideways. The red line is the signal line which is the 9th day exponential moving average. Which makes it look like a smoothed out version of the MACD line. All you need to know is that when the black line crosses the redline in a positive trend then the stock is going to go up, and when the black line crosses the red line in a negative trend then the stock Is fixing to fall.  To sum up, if you see a low RSI with a positive trend from the MACD you should buy or hold. And if you see a high RSI with a negative trending MACD line then you should sell or test your luck on holding. Everything is finite and the graphs are not always correct but these are great indicators.
First time gambling online and it was very good rush 😛😛
Let’s go get them, boys!
🚨🚨🚨 SPWR to the moon! 🚨🚨🚨
I saw this on r/stocks and agreed with this guy (u/comedian213)and figured I’d post it here. But heads up, I spiced it up a bit so it wasn’t so fucking boring.   Position: 50x SPWR 2/26 45C - Casino style, not this “shares”bullshit  Obligatory Rockets:                     Alright retards, let’s talk about SUNPOWER (SPWR)  OP, the “investor” fuck that he is, is looking for a long term hold and he thinks he found it: Sunpower (SPWR)  Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the industry. And that fucking industry is rapidly growing. We are talking printer go fucking brrrr. Thank sleepy!  Just google “top solar companies” and tell OP which companies have the best product and best customer ratings. Spoiler alert, Sunpower is #1.  Sunpower hit $57 dollars before crashing down to $40 where it hit hard hard resistance today. Were talkin huge buy orders for 2 mill+. And even look at who owns it - bunch Blackrock, Citedal, the likes. I agree, fuck these guys, but at the same time, why bet against them? It’s gonna go up, and keep going up.  What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing.   Some technical analysis for you autists. Sunpower literally has a revenue of 274 million, while Sunrun (at over 2x the market cap) is at 209 million. Sunpower also cut manufacturing costs by splitting into two companies (SPWR and Maxeon Technolgies). Maxeon is manufacturing solar panels for SPWR, and they are doing it overseas. This split happened in late August and has yet to affect their profit, but will completely reshape SPWR’s profit margin in the near future.  SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar sales don’t really pick up till spring. So getting in now and ride the rocket to the moon!   this is not investment advice. It is OP’s opinion. I am not a financial advisor.
"An unwritten book". I got a book too that I haven't written yet. Where my book deal? What. A. Joke.
BB news, I work in administration, not the stock market so all my advice is self destructive go as you will
The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. BB is holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now.
Why is everyone so mad that we lost some money?💀
Shhs its us losing money why are other people so mad at us?
Does Anyone post anything other than GME anymore ?
I know it’s Diamond Hands and all but We don’t have to say the clarity of our Diamond hands everyday. If you got Diamond hands you don’t talk about it. All I hear is VVS like y’all are Rappers. I used to come on this sub for all the wild ideas and earnings YOLOS now all I see is GME.
FYI you can search with "-GME -AMC" and filter those posts out.
For those of you who didn't know.
Robinhood removes limits on buying $GME
Broke the bil market cap today
I’m not going to give the full scope of the DD, do your own but here’s the snap shot.  $ENZC is over a billion now so I’m allowed to tell you retards about it. Last year at this time it was a trips play with terrible management.  September Enzolytics initiated a merger with Bioclonetics. The Bioclonetics CEO took over as CEO for ENZC, and this man has kept his word all along. One of the best low cap CEOs to date.  Bioclonetics science combined with Enzolytics science was a maneuver into a masterful biotech company.  They moved to Texas A&M the headquarters of Operation Warp Speed.   Essentially what they have is monoclonal antibodies that were originally developed as a treatment for HIV, and still will be used for HIV. Covid has HIV type qualities, and this turned into a Covid play pretty quickly. They also recently filed for a patent to treat MS.  The upcoming catalysts are a move from OTC Pink to most likely QB, but it’s expected that they could apply for the Nasdaq later this year when they meet the requirements.  The CEO has directly mentioned Eli Lilly and Gilead. They are currently undergoing a toxicity study, and once that’s accomplished they should get the green light from the fda, and the big pharma partnership comes into play.   This is a super rough, typing on my phone while I’m drunk version of the DD. But seriously look into it. I’ve been in since sub penny, it got up to .56 today before settling at .47. This is one of the most explosive stocks of the year and should be multi dollar.  5 year outlook it has the potential to be a $25-$50 stock. 3 billion authorized shares with a heavy insider ownership stake. Once this hits national news it will really blow up.  Again do more DD, this is the tip of the ice berg and very sloppily written.       so you know it’s real.
Fuck off with your bag holding shaming.
I bought 30 at $43 intending to hold long, so I'm not feeling the pain yet, but jesus fuck some of you are annoying as fuck. So people bought at 300 and are now holding some heavy ass bags. Who would have predicted that the dtc would increase interest 10 fold forcing brokers and clearing houses to scramble for money to fulfill orders, causing them to halt purchasing the stock for a few hours (or days, fucking robinhood). Yeah, with where we are right now I wish I would have sold last Wednesday when my $1200 was worth $13000 and gotten back in today.  Hindsight is a bitch. But how does it make sense if someone bought at 300 to sell at 50? A lot of these dumbasses came for the movement and have been saying they don't care if they lose anyway. At this point I feel like it makes more sense to just ride it out. Maybe it goes back up, maybe it goes back down to $2. But shaming people for still holding right now is just plain mean. Buy high, sell low isn't this subs mantra for nothing.   Tl;dr: stop encouraging people to paper hand.  Edit: this also applied to people who did sell. Just uh, the other way around.
Need a pick me up, well... too bad you get Loss porn, down 9k or more, the drop off right after is my money being fucking moved, because Fuck Robinhood
Automod can go die in a fire.
Seriously. I have tried 6 times now to get my post through and it keeps thinking I'm mentioning a certain digital asset.  How is it 500 gme post an hour can get through, but my post telling everyone to shut the fuck up about it can't?   Positions:   Lulu 310c 1/21/22  Dis 200c 3/26

Stop talking about GameStop!
You read the title you know what I’m purposing. It’ll clean the sub up, but more importantly the hedgies and SEC interns will get prevented from getting info, sentiment, and spreading more FUD. Misinformation and inaccuracies has turned us into a massive game of telephone. The echos in here got more erratic, incoherent, and unhelpful. We might’ve seen the peak with the apes and bots     but now we are publicizing our “hopeful dates”!? Stop that right now you smartie snorter you’re giving the enemy the days to target for max pessimism. They are scanning here daily on the minute to manipulate us to maximize their effectiveness. Why should they have our gameplans if they won’t show theirs? Silence is now our best weapon. Coordination will kill us if they’ll be preparing for it. If you’re long you’re long don’t check your brokerage for awhile, take a break from the news, and go spend some quality time with you wife’s boyfriend IDGAF. If you ate that dip you’ll probably ride it back to break even and some will continue to hold for the memes. Some will even add some chips for that tasty dip but don’t blame them for their decisions when to sell their life is different than yours and everyone has a limit. As for people investing now and pre rise (are you even worried? I’m not) hold for the story, the turnaround, the management, and the “possibility” of an infinite money glitch caused by jenius short sellers.. this is a different company than it was when we were younger and were just beginning to witness its metamorphosis.      🤡  Not financial advice, not a financial adviser. These are the opinions of a crayola connoisseur
Loss porn, started from a high of over $12k. Go big or go broke
GME - did hedge funds really covered?
First of all, I did not put in my life savings into GME or any other stocks and I don't have much to loose. I will be holding till the end! However, those who put a lot on the line, it is not my goal to tell you what to do.  Now, I was reading quite a lot and analyzing buy/sell data (  I'm new   to stocks and am looking for ways to invest some of my savings). I refuse to believe that all of the hedge funds who shorted GME or AMC  already covered. The numbers do not lie and I do not believe that everyone ran off to sell. I found this article and it seems to explain it well:     PS: I'm in no way a financial advisor. I'm just a regular retard. If HFs reading it, you are dirtbags!
Amc is valuable.✨
Fuck you Wall Street
First off, I love this community. I have a boner for all those holding. I respect those that decided to sell. But...  Fuck Wall Street  !  I got in at $320 for 1 and still holding because I love the stock.   Not financial advice you God damn apes. I don't know shit about finance. Just a rant about those crooks on Wall Street.
STILL HOLDIN
Whats wrong with moderator???
Anyone else see that Robinhood didn’t include A A C G in the top daily movers until after close? At the time of this photo, it was up +809%

Congrats corrupt mods you've made headlines

Looks like hedgies are comfortable again
ROBINHOOD GME LIMITS LIFTED???   NNDM IS THE (heavily shorted) SHIT BTW
Imagine what it's going to feel like to not hold the bag.
Friend of mine gave me some insider info on the hedges.
Edit: People questioning my credibility, fuck off why would I rat out my own source and put him on the spotlight??? You fucken dumb?  So a friend of mine personally knows a guy that works at a Hedgefund. He said the hedges unfortunately have already found a way to cover their shorts (illegally). We might not see a change the short percentages because all they have to do create new shorts that are profitable to cover the old shorts.   For example, if I have a short that's -$5, I just invest in a new short that's +$5 to cover for it. That's why the hedges have been doubling down over and over again. They also used these short ladder tactics to cover their shorts. They can do this over and over and over and over again. They're basically just recycling shorts in and out of the market.  I fucken hate to say it, but I think this is the end. They strategically and illegally found a new way to win. Unless someone else can refute this, I will hear you out with an open mind.  Keep in mind, I do want to fucken go to moon, but logistically and logically it doesn't seem possible right now when the odds are against us.   Edit: People questioning my credibility, fuck off why would I rat out my own source and put him on the spotlight??? You fucken dumb?
I'm confused about the short thing
Note: Haven't invested a dime into GME, just curious.  So what happened to the 144% shorted stocks? Were hedge funds paying them off en masse already before the whole thing went viral? Are they still up for grabs? I'm confused. Has this thing happened before?
Yo I'm not a retard but one of you should found a fried chicken charity called Tendies 4 the Friendlies

Not sorry Good thing the next Star Wars movie was in a few years  Wait did Disney know

Can we please get rid of these stupid useless power ups???
They are trying at least! Lol hopefully helps with the stock that was bought 🤔
Oh sick thanks RobinHood, really appreciate it.
Let this be a lesson to you all: Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they're in good company.

DEEPFUCKINGVALUE being made to appear in front of congress ?? For what ? They should be getting all these hedge funds in congress !
Mods for the love of god can you make temporary GME flair so we can filter out GME posts
You literally can’t find anything on this sub anymore, it’s one big wall of GME and AMC posts. The plays on GME and AMC have already been discussed at nauseam, there’s nothing left to gain here, you’re either holding until interest report is out or you sold.   we need to be able to filter out all this noise. There’s a lot of good plays being missed or lost in all the garbage and i desperately need to lose more of my money.   Positions:  BB 3/19 $15, 50 shares CGC 1/21/22 $55, 50 shares MSOS 50 shares
Paper bitch
Sold at a loss today, I hope deepfuckingvalue forged his last few screenshots
Professional Explanation Please 🙏🏽🤲  🌒
I have shares in #GME and I'm holding, but i don't know why I'm holding, lol. 🙉 What is the explanation why this "stonk" should go up? Not giving up, just wondering...
Temporary position limits have been lifted on Robinhood.
AMC back on the SSR list! Wont come off until Monday at 9:30am
Some porn for yall🤤, still diamond handing tho cause mama ain't raise no bitch
Welp. Learned a lesson
Only lost about $300 but damn I hate losing money. I'll keep putting money into my target date roth ira and leave the single stocks to the people who actually know what tf is going on.
I'm still in, no biggy either way to me so  🤲 but can someone explain this? It's been like this for hours?? .. Curious and need a big brain to explain.
Short Interest at 120% for GME according to ameritrade....
Is that number wrong or does that number mean nothing really? Just curious. Says as of January 15  I’m at 90,120,250,300 and I’m holding for the longgggg haul         Chewy and Amazon squad got this
Melvin is hoping that the paper hands will convince the diamond hands that it's over and time to sell. For that reason, I doubled my shares today. I'm either going down with the ship or to the moon

I won’t sell   Nor will you.   Melvin is a piece of 💩.   Check the price once a day Til’ February 9,   Things will be more than just fine.
Why cant gme do a tsla? With all this hype, people all over the world knowing about it, people invested in it etc shouldnt there be equal chance it goes up (and equal it goes down)?
F   !
Stock recommendation services,   Zacks, MotleyFool, etc... anyone have experience with those?
I’m genuinely curious to hear about experiences
Loss porn for 05/01/2021 🥲🥲🥲 I’ll keep holding boys        Going to buy $5k of GME on market open
When it dips but I HOLD into my 6 shares
Pot heads make YOLO GAMBLE
So my wife just YOLO on a new pot company. She didn't do any DD but while sitting on her PC, says to me while she's playing poker. I just bought 5k shares of a pot company. I guess I am not the true Degen anymore till I out do her.
If you still have   , consider selling covered calls
You can make some money while the stock is sideways/down, if you get assigned, well fuck, just don't get assigned. Use the premium to buy more. Infinite money glitch. Not financial advice, I am retarded.
Small change compared to what's standard around here, but I made $8,475 (basically 1/4 of my annual salary) from GME over a span of 7 trading days. I now have 4 shares left to  🤲 forever so I never forget this time in WSB history
PSA GME and holding at least till December 2021
Mods please don't delete.   Hi! I'm new here and I plan on holding GME for at least 12 months, to be exact December 27, 2021 Or beyond. The reason for this is I liquidated gains to go into   KNOW PEOPLE DON"T WANT TO HEAR TAX SHIT BUT... this is also strategy from my perspective. Eventually one has to cut losses and If I do cut losses than I would want to maximize my loss. I plan on investing for the rest of my life and eventually those gains will net against those losses. I can already use them but why would I? I have at least December. If I like GME maybe I will keep it, If I really don't want to pay tax or I want a nice loss carry forward (as in the loss is like balance on your return to net gains against) then I will do that. That gives me a time frame. I am a complete noob to this however I came in made a business/investment decision and I need to own that. It showed me I need to manage my emotions (still) and there is a lot I need to learn.  I am Canadian so technically if you have gains in prior years you can carry back. I am not sure who it impacts people from other nations but I am sure with some google fu you can figure that out.   I am still optimistic, at the same time life goes on and I have a ton of shit to do, like dropping of my wife's boyfriend to his guitar lessons. Till then folks.  EDIT: Forgot this is not financial advice or whatever. This is just my take. GME could still moon, and if so by all means get yours.
Can someone explain the GameStop thing?
I want to know more about trading and investing but I don't know how to get more knowledge or how to participate in these events.
Don't forget, there's always two sides to a trade
And its both sides that keep this game fun and interesting. It keeps going the WSB infighting, inbreeding, and the perpetual autism flywheel going. You may have lost this week and feel sick to your stomach... or you may have made a killing slinging puts and shorts. Either way, enjoy the fun and the heckling. This is the WSB I love. Like siblings fight, retards bicker. Some might feel the anger and hatred but this is the all familiar comradery to me. No matter what happens this or next week, ILY all and hope you get rich one day.  May the best hand win!  $40p 2/26  GME    EDIT: Also if you're new to the sub, always plug in one of these before the start of the trading day, it helps maintain focus:     EDIT 2: I'm getting messages complaining that by clicking that link, Amazon now thinks you want it. If you're following this sub, you do. You just don't know it yet.
Going down with the ship, I guess. Holding til the bitter end.
Looking To The Future?
We're sitting at an intriguing point in time, where the Covid vaccine hasn't hit wide enough circulation yet that we can return to "normal", so I'm setting my sights on industries that are pretty set to make a rebound in the future.  The obvious basic bitch calls that come to mind are travel and retail, but I'm curious where the folks still milling about on here are thinking about setting their sights and hedging their bets.  So what sort of next moves are you retards thinking about?
The GME hype reminds me of triple witching friday.
All the DD anf hype leading up to triple witching and the outcome.
Decent article. Maybe they will crackdown a little no doubt just a slap on the wrist for the brokers though
What happened to Wsb? It's unrecognisable now.
I've been visiting wsb for bad advice over the last few years but had to take a break after covid did it's financial number on me. Wsb is the reason covid didn't absolutely destroy me! I listened to you idiots screaming buy amd when it was under 5 like 4 years ago. The one thing that was always consistent here was the top post  being the guy/gal who lost the most. The comments were full of congratulations and/or reeeeeeeee. Everyone screaming buy amd before amd was making real moves. So I came through to see the uplifting loss posts with everything going on with gme but this sub is almost unrecognizable. So many comments telling people how dumb they are for losing x amount of money, no praising for extreme losses. No encouraging to remortgage the family home and double down. What happened? Why the sudden shift in attitude? Is wsb becoming conservative? Did hitting r/all one too many times finally take its toll? All this media attention have you on your best behavior?    Tldr: why y'all acting responsible all of the sudden?
Think I'm down 20K AUD (don't even try to keep score anymore - don't give a shit), HOLDING
Request: bring back the   post  This is my take:    Github source:    Not investment advice. Hope I've done a post correctly. First time. Cheers and greetings from Australia!    Loss below:    (  Note  : does not show my loss on paper today)     (  Note:   \+change = deposit received)
What is this about? Lol
They knew nothing was going to happen
"We expect the agency to explore and eventually approve tougher requirements on brokerage disclosures to customers, including making it clearer that firms can halt trading in stocks," wrote Ian Katz of Capital Alpha Partners in a note to clients earlier this week.   "Congress will talk a lot about the trading frenzy, giving hedge funds a verbal beating," he added. "Lawmakers will introduce bills, but we're skeptical that anything significant will become law -- unless the extreme volatility intensifies and extends to more stocks."

Paper Trading Contest!
Mods, with the influx of new users and the sentiment I’m getting from the sub over the last week; it’s time we have another paper trading contest to encourage real fundamentals and analysis. Let the noobs learn a thing or two before losing a thing or two. Let’s see it happen!

Fuck this loser trying to monetize our fucking sub
Was     HOLD movement started by a HF shill that knew everyone was about to suffer massive losses?
I feel like that advice sprung up quickly and was kind of suspicious? Just a curious thought
Ok guys
NO VIDEOS?  Wtf, I hope all you new mods end up hating your lives when you realize what pile of dung you are. You guys came in for the money and fame and have zero input or credibility over the last few years. You guys ruined the best thing on Reddit. I hope you enjoy watching your wives getting railed
Help me please
Okay so i got pretty good gains today off a stock today so i sold my position when it peaked around $19. around 5 minutes before the market closed i bought 1 share of SPY but someone it was actually 15 shares and i have no idea how it went through , also my account is a margin account. so now my cash balance on my margin account is $-5000 because it had to borrow money to be able to pay for the 15 shares. right after the market closed i saw that it bought 15 so i placed a sell order and it’s queued right now. i’m worried that i will be put in a margin call and have to pay that $5000. when the sell order goes through at market open will my account go back to positive cash balance so i won’t get a margin call?

Ofgem energy price cap is going to be raised
Ofgem has announced that they are raising the energy price cap after energy companies report that its customers are struggling to pay their Bill's as a result of covid/furlough. This is going to cause movement in the market I assume, does anybody have any advice on how to capitalise on this.  What does this mean for the every day people?  [source](
Friendly reminder to KEEP HOLDING
Why would you ever sell at a loss??
Went into the GME game last Thursday. Bought more on Monday. Got over 2000 eurobucks in it now. I'm fully aware this isn't a guaranteed win. I can lose it all and I'm mentally prepared for that. It's a decent amount of money (full month's wages) and losing it would suck, but I knew it when I got into it.  Now I hold because I'm not going to sell at a loss. I either sell with a profit or not at all. The trick is to only put as much money in as you can afford to lose, then you won't get panicky paper hands when thoughts like "how am I gonna make rent this month???" jump to your head.  If I lose everything I put in, I shrug and move on. It's not even 1% of my total savings.  But I am definitely going to bite myself in the ass if I sell now, and then it jumps back up later. What I lose if the stock stays down is just money. What I lose if I panic-sell now is a great potential opportunity.  Do I want to lose that opportunity? HELL NO. Therefore I HOLD.
WHO’S STILL HOLDING WITH ME?? Heavily upped my position on the dip. Next week is OUR week      ($150k+ invested at 24 y/o)
15 Facts About the Diamond [Hands]
First of all, obligatory    .  Second of all, I am one of the "little guys" in on GME at $260 and AMC at $13. Holding with my measly -$1000ish loss.   Now that I got that out of the way, let's learn about diamonds, shall we?  These 15 facts about diamonds was pulled from  .  I'd like to just post this as a very "I come in peace" post. Yes, I am biased towards those of us holding out prices. I also feel very proud that we helped pull AMC out of bankruptcy.  Anyways.  1  The ancient Romans and Greeks believed that diamonds were tears cried by the gods or splinters from falling stars, and Romans believed that Cupid’s arrows were tipped with diamonds (perhaps the earliest association between diamonds and romantic love).  We can imagine these tears of the hedge funds that were trying to create 20% more stock than is available, to then make a profit off of. Some (seeming) "gods" are mortal too.  2  Diamonds are billions of years old—in some cases more than three billion years old.  How about   The same as the market cap for $GME... Interesting.  3  Diamonds form about 100 miles below ground and have been carried to the earth’s surface by deep volcanic eruptions.  Months ago, something surfaced from the extreme deep. u/deepfuckingvalue that is.  This volcano is about to erupt.  4  Diamonds are made of a single element—they’re nearly 100% carbon. Under the immense heat and pressure far below the earth’s surface, the carbon atoms bond in a unique way that results in diamonds’ beautiful and rare crystalline structure.  The farther down this goes, the more pressure is being exerted, both on us, the holders and on the ones who have outrageous shorts. Your carbon hands will either burn up like paper or solidify and harden into beautiful diamonds.  5  The word diamond derives from the Greek word “adamas,” which means invincible or indestructible. Which makes sense because…  Together: adamas, divided we fall.  6  Diamonds are the very hardest natural substance. The only thing that can scratch a diamond is another diamond.  No high fives please.  7  Diamonds have been valued and coveted for thousands of years. There is evidence that diamonds were being collected and traded in India as early as the fourth century BC. In the first century AD, the Roman naturalist Pliny is quoted as having said, “Diamond is the most valuable, not only of precious stones, but of all things in this world.”  Those of us still holding, being formed by pressure. We are precious and we hold the value.  8  Ancient Hindus used diamonds in the eyes of devotional statues, and believed that a diamond could protect its wearer from danger.  Holding leads to pressure, pressure leads to diamonds, diamonds lead to protection. More diamonds, more protection.   9  Many ancient cultures believed that diamonds gave the wearer strength and courage during battle, and some kings wore diamonds on their armor as they rode into battle.  This is the highest medal one can give themselves. The   is a self-appointed badge of honor here.  10  During the Middle Ages diamonds were thought to have healing properties able to cure ailments ranging from fatigue to mental illness.  I don't think it's working on the mental illness front. And I believe most of us are fatigued, so as we all knew, the middle ages we're full of shit. (And trebuchets)  11  The countries that are the main sources of diamonds have changed over time. India was the world’s original source of diamonds, beginning in the 1400s when Indian diamonds began to be sold in Venice and other European trade centers. Then in the 1700s India’s diamond supplies declined and Brazil became the world’s major source of diamonds, until the late 1800s when a huge diamond reserve was discovered in South Africa.  Today, diamonds are mined in many parts of the world. Brilliant Earth goes above and beyond the current industry standards to offer Beyond Conflict Free Diamonds™ with a listed origin of Canada, Botswana Sort, or Russia.  Hands all over the world are now in this diamond trade with us. Just look at the posts a few days ago. Plenty of countries trying to make this movement work.  12  The largest diamond ever discovered was called the Cullinan diamond, and weighed in at an amazing 3106 carats, or   pounds. Discovered in 1905 in South Africa, the mine’s owner and the South African leaders gave the diamond to King Edward. The Cullinan was eventually cut into 9 large diamonds and 100 smaller ones, and the three largest of these are on display in the Tower of London as part of the crown jewels.  I'm not sure who has the largest overall loss right now, but I'm sure we can have a top 10 losses list somewhere at this point. (Loss from origin, not height).  Whomever holds that right now is definitely the largest diamond here.  13  The first known use of a diamond engagement ring took place in 1477, when Archduke Maxmillian of Austria gave Mary of Burgundy a gold ring featuring an M spelled out in diamonds.  When shit takes off, I will buy my wife's boyfriend a ring to ask her to marry him.   14  Lab diamonds have the same physical, chemical, and optical properties as mined diamonds. They are sustainable diamonds that have minimal environmental impact. Discover Brilliant Earth’s collection of lab diamonds.  All of our diamonds are the same. No matter the cost of production.  15  The most mind-blowing diamond facts of all: Scientists have discovered a planet that they believe is composed mostly of carbon, and is one-third pure diamond!  Discovered in 2004, the planet orbits a nearby star in the Milky Way, and is named “55 Cancri e” (which, in our opinion, is not a sufficiently glamorous name for such an extraordinary planet). Perhaps even more amazing, scientists have discovered a star that is essentially a diamond of ten billion trillion trillion carats.  They named the star Lucy after the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” (We approve.) While diamonds have clearly created a lot of joy for people throughout history, they have too often resulted in suffering in the communities where they’re mined. At Brilliant Earth we believe diamonds shine brighter when they’re sourced in an ethical, environmentally friendly way. Learn more about the issues surrounding diamond mining, and what we’re doing to bring about change.  We're all on this rocket. It's still primed. Fuck the moon, to Lucy we go!   There may be a lot of suffering. But as many here say, do not put your life's saving into this.  My two pieces of advice, If you can _bull_ with me; 1. only use money that you're willing to throw in a literal trash can. If you can do that and feel ok with it, then by all means, throw it away.  _MAYBE_ the trash collector will knock on your door and give you back your money as well as all the other money they found in the trash.  2.  NEVER. LOOK. BACK.  I hope this read brought a little stress relief to some of you.  As many suggest, stop watching the market and go do something else.
PSA: If you're holding, STFU. Citadel pays for order data, stop giving it to them for free by listing your positions!
I keep seeing threads about who's holding and huge lists of positions. Fuck that, just be quiet if you're holding. If you've already posted your positions you could try bullshitting where you're at now but it's probably too late. If I thought of this they definitely did too.  Source: am long time retard

$TSNP / HUMBL PAY
MY BROKE ASS JUST BOUGHT 2 GME WHOS WITH ME. RIMES TO MAKE SOME MONEY BITCHES
Here's which tickers were mentioned the most in discussion yesterday
I ain’t hear no bell!
If $GME$ hits $150 this week I will buy every single item on r/ActiveDeals & donate it to my local hospital.
I know it's coming, it's tough but it's going to be a rocket week. As soon as the HF have to pay their shorts we are up! I've invested over $20,000 CDN at around $40, so when $150 hits again I'm going on a charity spree getting everything on /r/ActiveDeals. I've been down almost my whole life so it's nice to have a win finally, and be able to share it with others in need.
TSNP and FORW
Guys. Check these two out. TSNP is going to become HUMBL (  Ticker change is this month. Look at the CEO - absolute stud.   Now turn your head to FORW, whose CEO used to be an OTC regulator - also a fucking hard ass stud. FORW owns 500 million warrants of TSNP.   You can either jump on TSNP for 100% gains or jump on FORW for 300% short term gains. Crazy money to be made here. Been following it since New Years and have never seen so many millionaires made in a one month period. For transparency, I am HEAVILY FUCKING INVESTED in FORW.
HOW ‘BOUT SOME LOVE FOR US WHO YOLO BOUGHT AMC @ PEAK AND STILL HOLDING🌌🛰🛰
Everyone that's still holding should read this ancient chinese proverb. Don't lose hope!
Once upon a time, there was a retard on WSB who had bought $GME.  Upon hearing about his investment, other redditors started mocking him. “Such a bad investment” they said, “You will lose it all.”  “We’ll see...” the retard replied.  One day the stock skyrocketed to $347.  “How wonderful” the redditors exclaimed! “You can sell now for huge profit. What great fortune you have!”   “We’ll see...” answered the retard.  The following few days, the stock started tanking and dropped down to $50.  The redditors came to offer their sympathy on his misfortune.   “Now you are down -90%.” they said. “What terrible luck you have! Sell now to save some of your money!”  The retard smiled to himself and said once again.  “We’ll see...”
News on BlackBerry
BB had an amazing ride up to almost   in one week, but unfortunately it was a causality in the meme stock hammer. Although it was pushed on WSB, it is still (in my opinion) a stock to buy or even look out for. Despite the drop, BB has been upgraded to a “strong buy” from Zach’s.  The new partnerships and press keep coming, and I truly think it can ride back to the at least their competitors valuations, seeing as it outperformed them all in their recent security test.        I have 5500 shares of BB, so this might be seen as a bias post, but i’m just sharing some good news on BB. Feel free to interpret the news as you see fit.
Reason for the GME price drop you've seen lately
So, after the recent news I'm sure you're super skeptical about buying up more GME.  Well, you see, there's an ongoing ladder attack going on that Hedge Funds are doing.  It's super complicated and I know what I'm talking about and have a shit ton of sauce, but your smooth brain just needs to know the terms "ladder attack" and that hedge funds are doing it.  If you remember the Volkswagen graph that just keeps popping up all over the internet. There was a price dip... that's where we are.  So just remember, buy as much GME today as possible.
The worst thing WSB community did was diversifying in meme stocks
We simply can't afford to diversify in meme stocks (We are not as rich as capital), we should have only aped at GME. Currently, the community is totally divided between GME, AMC, SNDL, NOK, BB & some other "liked" meme stocks and all have been seeing loss porn. I understand that ex. AMC holders hope to be in profit and so for NOK etc... But you guys have literally taken buying power from our original GME alpha in the hopes you can make more gains somewhere else "Even though GME was doing really well until you guys got a bit too greedy" Please revert your mistake and instead of having loss spread on all meme stocks, lets have all power on GME. I also advise mods to mute discord/telegram channels temporarily as they are the main fuel for fud & diversity.
AMC BUY AND HOLD       🤲
Why would you ever sell AMC right now when the stock is worth more than this as a company alone as soon as the pandemic lifts? Literally there is no reason to sell right now! Every day that the stock goes up or trades sideways, the hedge funds have to pay more and more interest, literally millions and millions of dollars burning them HEAVILY. This is just the calm before the storm people. They’re going to try to bore you out, distract you and draw your attention elsewhere, literally do everything they can to draw you away from AMC so they don’t have to pay as much. PATIENCE IS VIRTUE HERE. It took a couple/few weeks before VW in 2008 and it took time before GME too. Don’t let the naysayers or negativity fool you at all, there’s literally no reason to be selling!!!  AMC        🤲 🤲 (Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, I am an autist who loves the stonk)
WSB going through the stages of grief
This sub had been taken over
The mods of this sub have been bought and we cannot save it anymore. You can feel it too and i know it. I really have no clue how to stop the big man from killing the little man but we just cant win and i’m giving up and resorting to murder.
Seems legit.
Serious Question. Why would Hedges bother manipulating the price down if Shorts are covered?
If shorts were covered and they're relieved to get out of GME/AMC etc relatively unscathed.  Why would they still be manipulating prices down and putting out questionable news etc?   Surely their priority is to get out now ASAP if they're done with the stock
New Banner!?? Can we go back to the original or something with GME?
Feels like it's overdue for a change.
FoMo DD GME
Why does the stock market bubble every now and then? One of the greatest fears of ours is fear of missing out, FOMO. This makes people to jump on board with things they know little about but what they see are bringing value to their peers.  Why is FOMO important for us  ?  When GME sees the next bigger jump up, it triggers the fear of missing out. This gets more people to jump in. Once the price raises quickly enough things can easily get outof hand: gamma queeze and short queeze can be easily triggered. And now, when so many is following GME and the real float is super small (as we are holding, right?!     ) it will be 100x faster than the last jump so they would not have time to stop and manipulate the market.        💍  Tl;dr: Hold and        #notfinancialadvice don't trust me I'm just one
GameStop mania may not have been the retail trader rebellion it was perceived to be
Title says it all.
My thoughts on AMC
Think about the competition of AMC: -Netflix, Amazon, Hulu etc. Online streaming services are the most threatening competitors of the cinema industry... But the thing we need to focus on is the delivery of the product (the shows). The range of content on online streaming services is far wider, however, they are increasingly tending towards in house productions. Online streaming services have their content catalogues diversified and increasingly produced in-house. This way, they own the rights to the media and can stream it without paying enormous leasing fees. That's why Netflix keeps taking Friends off of their service, because another online service outbids them for the rights to the lease of that media. For this reason, and trust me on this I have studied this for a while, online streaming services will continue to vigorously upscale in-house media production (Netflix originals, prime originals etc) to lower operating fees.   Netflix has a ridiculous amount of long term debt (not necessarily bad, but important to consider) from fees to lease the rights to TV shows/movies.     NOW  .   HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO AMC?    AMC will host the showing of big movies, like the Avengers etc. Movies that will ONLY be in cinemas and NOT on Netflix. They have priority in massive budget movies which means that they will always have a source of customers, as long as the media industry continues to produce blockbuster movies.   AS SUCH: AMC can capitalize and sell merchandise, sell a show, an experience, and make money from many other sources instead of just the product (the media) itself (UNLIKE Netflix). That's why, in the long term, assuming the management of AMC doesn't completely go retard mode and COVID does actually go away one day, there will be a large customer base for the business.    NOTE: im eat crayon,     dont     know what the fuck im talking about pls dont yolo into amc because of me im not finance advisoer :)
I purchased $100 today, soon I’ll add another $500
IT WILL GO UP. HOLD YOUR LINE SPARTANS     👨‍ 👩‍
There will always be more opportunities, even if this one doesn't pan out. Don't forget!
Will the whole GME thing going on, a lot of folks might be kinda turned off from the stock market or even investing as a whole. For those still holding, good luck! For those left with a sour taste in your mouths, just remember that even though it might seem rigged half the time, the stock market still has plenty of opportunities to make money. I myself have learned a lot throughout this whole thing, albeit at an expensive loss, but I'm confident that with better DD and patience, I can meet that loss with greater returns down the line.   So if you're still in, godspeed and I hope this all works out, and if you're out at a loss, take a step back, rethink your strategy, and hop back in if and when you're ready. For those with a gain, good shit, and enjoy those tendies!
GME AMC     OR 🔪

We’ve all held out thus far seeing 80-99% losses, we can’t sell once we see it going up again thinking it’s the peak, we must prevail to destroy the hedge funds. RIDE TO THE MOON!!!

WHO IS HOLDING or ADDING MORE??
The fact that people here are still using Robinhood does not bode well...
Robinhood was central to fucking everyone over. That people are still using them does not reflect well on peoples common sense, thinking this is going to take off now that they have stopped restrictions. They didn’t want you to make money. Do you think they’ll let you try again?

hi retards
This sub is only hurting the little guy at this point with the $GME Hold posts.
The last 2 weeks the little guy won and we hurt big business.  Now that Hype and fun train is absolutely over and has reflected in the price.  Telling all these newbies to continue HOLDing a stock from a dying company is doing nothing but losing more and more money from the little guy. The very same person we wanted to win the battle... is now in the same shoes as Hedge fun’s last week and the week prior.  GameStop is a company that sells physical copies of video games. They held on by selling toys and other random gadgets. The same thing that happened to Movie stores, and CD stores is now reflecting in video game stores. They are literally making new consoles that don’t even have physical video game slots for example.  I’m a gamer myself and I hate to see it go, but I also hate seeing this sub be so biased and Karma feed HOLD posts to a company that is dwindling away.  Sell your stock? That’s up to you if you think $GME will flourish once again in this digital world. Because the Hype/Viral driven price and market manipulation has passed.
OKAY WHOS STILL HOLDING INTO THE WEEKEND?!?!?
Thank you community
First, I'd like to thank this community for allowing me to finally transition into the stock market even if we are betting really hard for GME and AMC to skyrocket to the moon. If it wasn't for this group and their attack on HF assholes I'd still be spending money like an idiot on my mobile gaming.   I know everyone is exhausted, there was massive infighting amongst the mods and hopefully this community comes together, and a lot of negative comments derailing people into selling. I may be a complete noob in this and I'm sure as hell not as financially invested as many others here but I still stand with this movement and will continue to hold   .  There are many issues with the way the market is being manipulated if it is however, we still have strength in numbers and must continue to work together to pull this off.   May everyone have a good Friday let's fucking get it fellow
Some small time loss porn, I'll keep holding or lose it all with you fabulous apes
GME AMC... that was anticlimactic, kinda.
Yea the squeeze happened, but as Marc Cuban said, “now’s the time to see what you’re made of!” Are we just gonna let him down? Did the hedge funds get out of their short position? Cuz if not, I say we pump these bitches up again, and stick it to these cunts even harder!   If so disregard my restarted ass post!
I’M STILL HOLDING GME, WILL YOU??!?    🌕
Look. I lost a lot of money after buying GME at 300. I’m still holding, but at least I can get some karma out of this? Help an autistic out, alright?
How much do we really know (about $gme fiasco) based on facts?
To give you a bit of background around myself and my trading experience (there is no such a thing about me), I made around £45k profit trading based on what I read and I was extremely happy with that. I bought 400 shares at trade on the 13th of January for around $31 dollars and sold them that same day, 15 minutes later for £120 profit and then I found out about its peak and Reddit story and so on. Of course, I regretted not keeping them but then I took another ride based on the hype and bought at $324 another 45 shares which I am holding as I am around -85%.  Now, I know that my decision of buying at $324 was solely based on what I read/hoped but I do not know how much of that is factual. There should be a handful of people here really good at this who can explain everything to all of us, the confused apes/retards, and give us a clear and realistic view of the scale and what are the odds for something big to happen (as we all hope this to go to the moon).  My fear is that many people jumped on this ride based on hype and we are the laughing stock of the hedge funds but even worse is that some people will go into debt based on false hope. I am lucky enough not to fall into the second category but I feel for those who will.  I hope someone can spare the time to explain to the many of us, in a very simple way, what is going on and what are the odds of thins having a happy end for all of us.
Did the math, here's how you make your money back
The average inflation rate of the dollar is   per year, which gives us the equation:  50 \   \  =    So, in approximately 155-156 years, given that the stock stabilizes at 50 dollars (which won't happen), you will have your money back. Just make sure your kids get the diamond hands too so they don't fuck up the money. This is totally how it works (no it ain't)        Edit:                    to the moon baby

U LIKE NOK? BB? AMC? GME? U HOLD ON TO THOSE PUPPIES LIKE THEY WANT ALL UR CUDDLES N LOVIN. IM A RETARD AND THIS ISNT FINANCIAL ADVICE BUT A CALL TO ACTION FOR ALL FELLOW AUTISTS WHO WANT TO HEAD TO THE MOON W ME
The upside: wsb probably stopped GameStop from going bankrupt
Maybe this sub is the reason GameStop won’t disappear completely? Now they have a chance to turn their business around.    I’m a retard who’s still holding ( 1@220, 2@69), purely out of stubbornness. But I also like the stock.
How $GME can still be a great play
Since the original post got removed, here it is again:    This is the investor relations email for GameStop, email them telling them your full name, the country you're based in, and the number of shares you own and request an Emergency Shareholder Vote and a Reverse Stock Split. An Emergency Shareholder Vote would mean eliminating all synthetic stock and taking leverage away from short-sales and a Reverse Stock Split would cause Citadel and any other phantom shares creators to be stuck holding their losses on their shorts position. This is the quickest way to help end this situation once and for all.  You can do this using the template below created by u/Whiplash51  Subject : Fears of potential securities fraud  Hello,  My name is  --  --, I am located in  -- and I currently own  -- shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.  Thank you for your time,  (your name)
Alright guys this is it! Hour to market open!!
Jk I have no idea if this is it. It really doesn't matter because these   🧤 are holding. Not for a day or week or month. However long it takes.   I like the stock. Gme, BB, AMC
For everyone saying ladder attacks haven't been mentioned anywhere before last week and were made up by WSB
You should learn how to fuckin Google.    "The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of "strategic fails-to-deliver" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will "mask" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news."      Seeking Alpha, 1/25/2014    5 GME @ 190

If you’re holding GME, what’s your exit strategy?
I’m curious as from this Reddit I got the idea the majority of people were buying shares or calls, not in a value play like someone such as DFV or Michael Burry, but due to the fact the share price was rising rapidly due to a “short squeeze”. So here we are now, the share price plummeting, and the chances of GME reaching $100-$500 any time soon is slim, at least I haven’t heard a compelling reason. Hence, using your previous strategy, wouldn’t you predict the share price will continue to fall?  Therefore my question to those posting about holding, what’s your plan?
Does anyone know if Diamond Dave Portnoy is still in GME?
Haven't seen any updates from him on GME. I have a good feeling he's still in. They don't call him Diamond Dave for nothin'.

WSB is INFESTED with shill accounts - go look for yourself
I just looked through the overnight GME page. I looked at account ages for any comment that were posting negative comments about GME. I’m not joking, I could not find ONE account that is over 3 years old and they all have very similar karma. Mostly sub 1000 post karma and sub 10,000 comment karma. They are strikingly similar comments and accounts.  There has also apparently been some sort of mod takeover at WSB which makes this feel even more weird to me. I don’t know if I’m being paranoid or not but it feels extremely suspicious. Go look for yourself!
Where do I get a physical copy of my $GME share(s)
I want one to frame so I can tell my kids how I became my wife's boyfriend in the 2021 stock wars.

Google Stock Analysis [Full DD]  Is Google Stock a BUY right now?
In this post we are going to go through an in-depth analysis of Google, we are going to take a look at their fundamental value, their Discounted Free Cash Flow, do a little technical analysis and set some price targets for the near future and for the long term    \~Very Long Post\~ \[Don't Read Unless You Like DD\]    Hello everyone! Let’s start by talking a little about   , they are one of the biggest companies in the world that generates most of their revenues and income from online advertising services provided through their platforms like Google Search & YouTube while also expanding into multiple other businesses like cloud services and autonomous driving technology through their venture Waymo.  The company was founded in 1998 and has more than 130K employees, with the company performing quite well in the past year gaining more than 30%.  I believe Google will continue to   as their cloud platform will remain one of the biggest in the world, while also continuing to innovate and develop other emerging businesses that might turn out successful in the long-term, while their main competition is Baidu & Bing for the search engine, but their market share is still completely dominant, as they also compete with social networks & online retailers for advertising placements.  So, guys, let’s go a little through the 4th quarter & yearly results for Google.  Google smashed   expectations for the 4th quarter with a beat of more than $6 on EPS and $4B in total revenues.   The company   a revenue of almost $57B in the 4th quarter while generating revenues of over $182B in 2020, representing a 12% increase over 2019 as they operating income also grew to over $40B for the first time despite a very slow start to the year through the first 2 quarters as their ad revenues were crushed due to the lack of travel & other leisure industries as those are some of the biggest advertiser income streams for them.  The company sustained a significant growth rate in the past year in their 2 major income segments, with their services business which grew by 11%, and the cloud services which also more than doubled their revenues, but the cloud services is still losing money as they keep investing into expanding their services to compete with the other major cloud players like Amazon, Microsoft & Alibaba.  The   has also started this quarter to report their google cloud results separately to give a more detailed view on how the company is performing, as we can now see how the company has managed to increase their revenues streams and how big the YouTube Ads revenues have become for them as those increased by 30% in the last year. Meanwhile the revenues from Google Search also rose by 6% and the Cloud Segment spiked by 46%, as they also have a big backlog in this segment.  So  , the company has managed to increase their revenues in constant currency by 14% in the past year while also improving their operating margin by 2%.  Google has managed to keep growing and improving their business operation through major capital expenditures that have accounted for over $22B in 2020. I believe the big spending on capex is really needed, as the competition in the cloud segment in really heating up, so I like companies that keep reinvesting into themselves, as they have also spent over $27B on   in 2020, as they keep investing into most of their products and adding new ones in the pipeline.  Also, for the projections of the discounted free cash flow it’s important to   that they had over $13B in Depreciation & Amortization in 2020, with this number growing between 15-30% in the past 2 years so I while use a 15% increase for the projections to be safe. The other big number that is important is their overall capex spending, which has gone down in the past 3 years, but as things might   up again as they mentioned in their earnings call, I will continue to grow this spending by   expecting things to normalize after the company went for a safer approach in 2020.    in the 4th quarter of 2020, buying back over   shares in just the last 3 months, thus continuing to reward their shareholders even more  There are a couple of negative outlooks for the company though, as their   tax rate has increased in the past years, and this might continue to go higher depending on future tax reforms so I will take into account some small raises in the tax rate.  The next problem is the regulatory pressure which can be another bump in the road for Google, but I mostly expect things to drag along and may eventually end with something similar to what happened to Microsoft. Even If they somehow end up breaking their businesses, I think we can see the Cloud business trading at insane P/Es which would increase the actual value of the resulting stocks, while the search engine and YouTube will remain very powerful even without the contracts with OEMs, which would result in better margins and less operating expenses, as most people would still turn to Google for their searches and videos.  The final problem for Google is the privacy issues, but it seems they have found a way to substitute the traditional cookie technology with a new software interface called Federated Learning of  .  This technology seems to have at least 95% of the same power of conversion per dollar compared to cookies which would be a huge boost to their privacy issues concerns and will help them maintain their dominance in the online ad’s world  But this isn’t the only technology Alphabet is trying to develop, they still have other proposals in works as well, which might come in even better, so we will have to wait and see what they go with.  Meanwhile, Google also offered some   for 2021 as they expect easy comps in the first half of 2021, while they are planning to   up the pace of investments this year.  They also expect to keep investing in cloud segment as their   which stands at $30B is mostly attributable to the cloud segment, as Alphabet will continue to focus on long-term growth that will benefit them in the long run as operating results & margins go.  For the price targets, I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates and expectations. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on…  So, let’s start with the discounted free cash flow   to see what the current valuation of the company is.  I used their total revenues projections that we will discuss later in the long-term projection, and the net income for 2020, to which I added back the Depreciation & Amortization costs they had in 2020 and got to an EBITDA of almost $55B  For the next years I used a small increase in EBIT margin which I think they can achieve pretty easy and also applied a 10% decrease in their net working capital.  I increased the capex spending and their D&A as I previously mentioned, so, for an 8% discount rate, which is pretty much the average SP500 return in the past decades and is what I like to use as a discount rate, given the current low interest rates, we get almost $190B Discounted Free Cash Flows by 2025.  Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for both of them we do have to subtract or add the net assets or debt of the company, which in this case stand at a net $200B in assets. I personally think a use of the average is better suited for most companies, though most of the companies trade largely on the EBITDA approach.  If we do use the growth approach, we can see that GOOG is slightly overvalued right now, as this implies a loss of about 5%.  On the other hand, a good EBITDA multiple for the company I think is about 20, as the stock currently trades over this multiple, but for safety reasons, I think 20 is pretty reasonable.  And given this multiple & approach we get a valuation of over $2700, or a 32% undervaluation of the company.  But as I said, I think a use of the average is best, so, my current price target for Alphabet in 2021 is $2326, implying a   return from the last price    Guys, next let’s move on to a longer-term valuation of the company based on the growth projections I have for Google.  For my   I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream.  I think we can continue to see 50% growth rate in the Cloud segment for 2021 as businesses keep needing cloud services more & more, and then implying a gradual slowing of their growth rate  For the Google Services (which include Search, YouTube & other revenue streams) I implied a 12% growth, just above last years, as YouTube keeps booming and the leisure industry advertising will slowly come back. But, for reasonable purposes I also implied a gradual slowdown of this trend by 1% each year  I believe these growth implications are pretty reasonable giving the high market share in the search segment and the demand for cloud services platforms.  The 2 other revenues streams which are Other Bets & Hedging I pretty much left unchanged as they don’t really have that big implications on the final number, but I did add a small amount of growth in both of them.  For their cost of sales, I started from the current ones and maintained them for 3 of their segments, while for the Google Cloud cost of sales I implied a gradual improvement of about 14%/year. So, I am implying they reach profitability by 2024 and reach somewhat of an AWS type of profitability by 2025.  Guys, if we add all of these up, it means for 2025 we would get over $334B in revenues and $237B in expenses, resulting in a gross profit of almost $97B.  I also   $7B this year I implied small annual growths, thus leading us to a $  in earnings before tax.  I also slightly   their   effective tax rate to about   by 2025 in order to somewhat account for possible tax changes in the future and also accounted for some share buyback programs of about 1% each year.  So, for the $62B in 2025 revenues after tax and accounting for 653M shares, that would mean a $  earnings/share, meaning the   is trading at almost 22 times forward price to earnings for 2025.  Guys, for my personal projections I like to use Forward/PE valuations & multiples, so, with the current projected PE and depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 25 and 40, the stock can trade between $2381 and $3810  After all these estimates what are my price targets?    are my actual price targets… I think the 2025 bear case price we can see Google trade at is $2619 which would imply a return of  , while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Google will trade at 3095$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 50% return on the current price.  My most bullish case though, would see the company trading at $3572, which would imply a return of almost 74%.    So yeah guys, these are my Overall price   for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 25 & 30 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 30 and 35 PE’s with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 35-40.  I think these are pretty reasonable targets, as the cloud services will continue to boom in the next decades, while they will also benefit from an increased reach for their search engine and booming YouTube platform as more people are getting internet access each day, and we shouldn’t forget that they might have even more great products in the pipeline with interesting names like Waymo.  Alphabet also has very good  , with almost $320B in assets vs just $97B in total liabilities, which can be easily paid by the current $137B in cash, cash equivalents & marketable securities  I also like to take a look at what the estimates are from the other analysts, and in this case, we can see an average EPS   by 2025 of $117, which is way higher than my $95 EPS estimates.  The analysts also expect over $370B in total   on average, which is also more than $35B ahead of where my targets are pointing, so, I think it’s safe to say I have been pretty conservative & reasonable with the growth expectations for the company.  You are probably wondering, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for GOOGLE?  Let’s start by taking a look at this  , we can see that Google was trading in an increasingly tighter wedge formation since the September lows. Right now, after smashing the earnings report the company has re-entered overbought territory with an RSI of over 70, which we haven’t seen since the big September sell-off. This breakout from this wedge formation came on the back of massive volumes for the stock, so I believe we can see the overbought conditions push the stock lower in the near-term before eventually going back even higher as I expect with my $2326 prediction for the end of the year.  I also think the $1920 to $1935 range can act as future support after it was a good resistance point for the stock  But, let’s also take a quick look at what 44 analysts on Wall Street are  . They are mostly very bullish on the stock with an average price target of $2171 and a high price target of $2610. So, guys, I think the analyst still have some catching up to do with upgrades to the stock after the recent earnings report.  Are you asking yourself, what would I do?  I believe it still has plenty of room to  , so I would start building a position if the stock drops under $2000 and especially buy more if it goes to the previous resistance levels between $1920 and $1935  I also believe that the big % of their shares held by  , with over 72% of the float being held by big funds like Vanguard & Blackrock does significantly reduce the sell-off possibilities and increase the support levels power.  So, these are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Google has a terrific future ahead, with their market   to continue to grow and take share of the total ad spending worldwide.  I believe Google will remain one of the best companies in the world while also being a good catch-up play to the other big tech names, as Google has underperformed   to most of the other big names with the exception of Facebook.

The bag - a Reddit Story about GME, ehem, I mean bags
Written by u/t4t0626  Directed by u/t4t0626 Created by u/t4t0626 Eaten by u/t4t0626  I have had many bags in my hands throughout my life. Of many types, shapes and colors. The vast majority of them were empty. Others I filled over the years with things I grew fond of, and ended up loving even the bag that contained them. But as a poor person, my bags usually have a pretty basic use: they serve to carry things and in the end they end up empty and forgotten, given their ridiculous price and the huge amount of them that exist.  During the last few days I am living a curious situation: I got a pack of recyled bags that I like. I've been using them for a few days and I'm happy. But people around me keep telling me that my bags are empty and worthless. The pack cost me 3 dollars. But they want me to sell the bags to them for a few cents, because they insist that they are worthless, and that if I keep them my personal economy will lose out. They say they are only looking out for my best interest. And, honestly, if I analyze my new bags... those criticisms seem to be right... after all, they are just colorful bags, like any other. Maybe I should sell those bags.  But what I find so strange about all this... is that no one has ever, ever in my life, been interested in an empty bag in my hands.

The fire dragon
If you bought $GME at 250+, just hold.
At this point, there is nothing you can do, except wait for Tuesday, when the short interest data will be released. If you sell now, you’re going to be making significant losses. If you wait through today and Monday, and the short interest data is in our favor, we continue to hold. If it isn’t, you can decide to sell at that point. It won’t even be a large difference in losses from today to Tuesday. You’re still probably going to be losing a lot of money, but you’d be hopping off at the right time. I personally think it’s worth waiting until Tuesday. Just hold. Hold because there’s nothing else we can do. Also, if you’re planning on buying a lot more, spread it over a few orders instead of a bulk order.   For legal reasons, I am not a financial advisor. But I believe we can do it. We just need to stop bullying and harassing each other. We are not each other’s enemies. Paper hands, diamond hands are NOT your enemies. Diamond hands, paper hands are NOT your enemies. Don’t bet on more than you can afford to lose.
ZRX ?!
The next big pump. Everyone is in play
It ain't much, but it's honest work
The hedgies think they’re winning
The Reuters report came out for GameStop and the short positions on it. It reports hedge funds are UP $  billion this week alone after losing roughly $  billion over January. Now, I hope you retards have your diamond hands ready and liquidated all other assets includes your wife’s boyfriends vinyl collection, cause we riding this shit till the moon. The interest report on the shorts along with a boost in stock price will either force brokers to yet again halt trading and bailing out the hedgies proving severe market manipulation (again) or they will do nothing at let them dissipate into empty suit shells.   $GME moon      Not a financial advisor
How many people are going to switch to traditional investment accounts now?
I personally just trade through HSBC and I understand why it could be beneficial to use the apps, but how many people are just going to switch to somewhere with normal transaction fees?   I see people here trading like 200k in RH and the first thing I think is "why aren't you using a normal account?"   No judgement I just want to understand the logic!
NYSE Arca Notices restricts GME short sales until the 8th (Links on comment section)
AMC could be more than a meme given current climate.
This is not financial advice I literally just dove into this.    AMC historically has been up to $34 in 2017.  I believe with current vaccinations being rolled out, warmer weather on the horizon, and a bottle neck of delayed theatrical releases, now is the time to buy and hold.
GME to the moon!
No more RH limits!  Cmon guys let’s get back the momentum!  Don’t let the HF and media win!  BUY AND HOLD BABY!    🏼 This is our chance.   Don’t let us down brothers  Edit: I don’t use RH and I recommend that after this is over you don’t either.  I personally use TD and their thinkorswim platform
Las night I went to bed feeling pretty down
It wasn’t about GME going negative yesterday, I don’t give a fuck about that cause IM NOT FUCKING SELLING.  It was about this subreddit going negative. I knew that I wasn’t alone but watching the amount of bullshit getting to the top that wasn’t conducive to positive morale really sucked and made me feel like I was.  I get that I’m new here and haven’t seen the losses financially like some of the OG apes but I know what it’s like to lose in life, I did so for a really long time struggling with addiction.  I’m good now (over   years clean) but the most important part of recovery to me is community and being a part of something greater than myself.  With covid it kind of put a   on my meetings and this place has helped to fill that void a little over these past couple weeks.  Thank you to everyone here, thank you to the mods for staying strong during a fucking coup. For real you guys and gals inspire me.  tl;dr   🏼 FOREVER and I guess we got  🍆 now too  FUCK THE SUITS  FUCK THE   🏼 BITCHES  TOGETHER STRONG  WE ARENT FUCKING LEAVING  THRUSTERS ARE GO               🌛
Why silver is the play of a lifetime (Satire)
Since silver is a tradable commodity you can take deliveries of it. This is important because you need to physically have it to make bullets.   Why do you need silver bullets? Because werewolf’s. I think the market hasn’t priced in the full scale of werewolf penetration into our population.   Working with basic numbers according to Herodotus there was a large population of werewolf’s beyond Thrace and across the Ister. Working with some rough estimations for the size of the population in the region the village was maybe around 2,000 people. If we subdivided this excluding non werewolf’s, there were maybe 400 werewolf’s present at the time.   Using some quick calculations, the world population at the time was 150,000 and it is now   billion that gives us a growth factor of around  52,000%(even bigger than your GME gains) if we add that to the estimated 400 werewolf’s present. We come to the conclusion of 20,800,00 werewolf’s alive right now.   Based on extensive field research from Bubba I have concluded the average werewolf takes 7 bullets to kill completely. If we need to coat each bullet in an ounce of silver. That’s 145,600,000 million ounces of silver which converts to 9,100,000 million pounds of silver.   Silver currently trades at  $ per pound. This means 1,879,000,000$  of silver need to be purchased . This is a massive in priced in demand of silver currently.  TLDR silver      Need silver to kill werewolfs
I didn't hear no bell! Who else is holding or (even better imo) buying?
Also trying to get some Karma to comment posts ($  / - 85%)
My comments keep getting deleted 'cause of the low karma. Anyway, i got in basically at almost the ath, still holding! Helping with what i can!

$CCIV will make us all rich!
Alright listen up you imbeciles! Last post got shadow banned so posting again . I know some of you have made some sexy gains on GME but most of you have been burned (keep holding). But this post is not discuss GME as it is time for us to become rich now! CCIV is a SPAC that is set to be merged with LUCID MOTORS, which is believed to be a TESLA COMPETITOR. Stock has moved last few days but has pulled back a bit today so it’s the perfect opportunity for all of us retards to jump in and make some big gains. Volume has been there, and being in the EV sector we know this will fucking blow up!!!! Join me to the moon you fucking idiots let’s travel the universe together!
Let's make $GME trend on Twitter today!!!!
Today we could have a big turn around! Hype seems to be back and at the current price who doesn't want to buy more shares??? Let's spread the word, making it trend on Twitter would be huge!!!!
To all my brothers still holding I'm there with you... I'm not selling...
Village Farms International - VFF
VFF has been in the business of growing and selling vegetables in Canada/US for the last 30 years.  As a result, they've amassed quite a few things along the way.  They currently have approx 5M sq ft green house in TX and 5M in BC Canada as well as several partners in CAD/US/Mex (approx 12M sq ft of growing space).  On top of that, they've been selling to all the major grocery chain (Loblaw, Safeway, Trader Joes, Walmart, Wholefoods, etc. for years).  On top of that, they have decades of experience navigating the regulatory obstacles that is the USDA.  Why is all this relevant you ask?  Why should you give a shit about a vegetable grower who was able survive for 30yrs on razor thin margins (\~3-5%)?  Because they are pivoting to Cannabis and making a splash.  They operate their cannabis division in Canada under the name Pure Sunfarms and have curretly dedicated 2 of the 5M sq ft space to it and able to grow more as necessary.  All numbers in USD  Low  , High    Q4/FY20 ER expected - My service say 2/16 but they've traditionally released it mid March     TLDR;  \- Only profitable Public LP in Canada (not squint real hard adjusted ebitda profitable, but actual fcf/net income profitable)  \- Grossly undervalued compared to their peers (by marketcap)  \- Recently came in 4th for retail sales in Ontario only after 1yr of receiving their sales license compared with other LP's having years head start.  They hold the pole position for flower sales (by brand) at OCS online  \- Lowest cost producer (can grow at \  and all in cost around .60/g)  \- CEO/founder owns about 13%+ of all the shares  \- Large LPs (like ACB) have pretty much given up on growing in bulk and buying from them wholesale b/c it's cheaper  \- Already have US presence  Profitability  Check any LP on ycharts and you can see most LPs have been losing money since day 1 compared with VFF.  It's patently absurd how poorly these companies are run.   \_cash\_flow   \_cash\_flow   \_cash\_flow   \_cash\_flow     Grossly Undervalued   Given all the money losing companies, we have (from YHOO finance):  APHA -    CGC -    ACB -    TLRY -    VFF -    Sales Performance  4th on retail sales per   \#1 dried flower on ocs online   Again, all this only after 1yr of receiving their sales licenses.  Lowest cost producers  As noted, they had to survive for years on razor thing vegetable margins so they've learned a thing or two about growing things cheaply.  While other LP's were spending millions/billions building/acquiring space, VFF quietly and efficiently converted their existing greenhouses for growing cannabis with the single goal in mind of producing it as cheaply as possible realizing that cannabis is just another commodity.  They've since stopped publishing their costs to produce for competitive reasons but left it last year in the   range and recently said they feel they could do it much cheaper based on tech advancements and picking out strains.  To punctuate their commitment to low cost operation, they have their own power plant recycling methane from a nearby dump site and converting it into power.  A recent comment by the CEO said that the nearest competitor spends roughly 2x more to produce 1g of cannabis.  That is huge!  CEO owns about 10M shares of the 75M shares outstanding.  First, 75M shares outstanding (about 65M float) is peanuts compare to the to others (maybe a little off given some <cough> ACB <cough> like to dilute every other week)  APHA - 317M  CGC - 374M  ACB - 160M (after a 12:1 reverse split else they'd be 2B+)  TLRY - 160M  So CEO owns about 13% of the company and is therefore majorly aligned with shareholders.  The management is top notch only diluting when absolutely necessary and aren't writing down 10's of millions/billions of assets like these other guys.  Wholesaler  As it turns out, being able to grow at low cost not only gives you the ability to dictate market prices in the retail channels (their products are generally the lowest prices around and they're still able to make a profit), but it affords them the opportunity to uniquely dominate the wholesale channel.  In fact, wholesale made up roughly 50% of their revs last Quarter!  As noted, ACB has all but given up on growing their own weed favoring buying it on the wholesale market (from VFF) b/c it's actually cheaper for them?  Huh?  US Presence  Let's face it, the US market will be YUGE.  If Canada, with it's 35M inhabitants, is projected to be a 5-10B market, you can multiply that by at least a factor of 10 for the US with its 350M peeps.  Everyone and their brother is vying for a spot there.  VFF already has a 5M sq ft greenhouse in TX and has said that they can enter the market once the States Act is passed.  Guess what?  Congress is currently working on that to make it a reality:   On top of which, they have a small investment in a company working the ASIA market.  I actually think this will be another dominant market consider how much these guys smoke (where do you think all the cigarette revs are coming from these days now that the it's no longer hip to smoke in the US?)

Shoutout to you guys.
Just want to say respect to you guys for bring true to yourselves. I always thought this sub was ironic but it actually is a bunch of retards gambling.  Not an ounce of financial knowledge among you.   In a world of phonies you stand out.   Wall Street BETS. I'm retarded. Diamond hands.  Respect.
What’s more sadder than GME losses? The quick decline of this subreddit to trolls.
Loved this place because of its genuineness.  Since the increase in pop culture awareness, the posts have been flooded with karma farming/ trolls/ and down right malicious advice.  I don’t know how to fix, but I think the damage has been done, and that makes me sad.
I was looking for something positive that came out of the $GME debacle...
and I realized that if this will lead to the downfall of Robinhood and the hoodlum approach to investments, we will all win. Robinhoodlums tried tu disrupt all the laws of investment. TSLA at the $850 billion valuation with almost no net income (still) is a result of hoodlums doing a flash mob raid on a stock. Maybe this will be the end and the order in the markets will return. If that required my $GME loss, that loss was money well spent.
Buying more.
AMC SHORT %
As of TODAY, it is speculation the amount of shorted shares for AMC is 84-88% or HIGHER.  Numerous charts are going around from different websites SPECULATING, that there is only 150K+- SHARES available left to be shorted.  This does not include NAKED shorted shares, (Basically fake shares) at this rate, if the shares are continued to be bought and HELD it could put the Shorties in an absolutely TERRIBLE position going forward.  THE LESS SHARES THEY HAVE TO BUY BACK TO COVER THE BETTER.  Trading restrictions got lifted today so anybody that was stuck with robinhood is allowed to trade once again, MONDAY majority will be transfered over to new brokers, THIS COULD BE THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM PHASE THEORETICALLY.  I am not a financial advisor I am spitting out speculations of numbers from numerous websites, if you do buy, only afford what you are prepared to lose, and are prepared to hold. This is wall street bets not Wall Street Guarntee.

Help me understand
I have been following the bananas for a few weeks now, and hitting the books real hard trying to form any kind of wrinkle in my silky smooth brain. People seem to be getting really down and distracted by the market value price of gme, but that’s never really been what this is about correct?  If we assume the squeeze hasn’t been squoze, then the goal was to hold enough shares from the market to force the shorts to come to us, begging on their knees and they bleed from interested to sell to them.  It’s not about cranking the market value up, in fact if you remove the media frenzy which probably caused a lot of normies to rush out and buy, the price probably wouldn’t have pulled a recent space x rocket launch.   It’s about storing all the shares like a fucking squirrel until winter comes, right?  However the issue is there is not enough public/reliable data that provides the information about the shorts position (until the 9th but will be outdated by then too?)
What would you do if you were a hedge fund?
When the price goes to $500 a share would you say   “Aww man. Guess they got us, time to bankrupt our company  ‍♂️ “  Or would you wait a couple days to see if the price goes down to potentially keep your company afloat? If it doesn’t go down you’re still bankrupt so why not wait and see?  Option 1: You 100% lose your company and all the money  Option 2: You have a chance to keep your company alive by just waiting and paying interest. Sure it sucks but it’s a chance.   Think about it you monkeys  🐒
Pre market volume - Question
On this   there is a section "GME Pre-Market Quotes".   Does "Pre market volume" mean how many shares are available, or how many shares have been traded premarket?
Trying to gain karma so I can post         🏿 🏿 🏿 like the rest of you retards. Apparently I don’t have enough.
Like the title says. I keep getting banned and muted because I don’t have enough karma or they think I’m a bot. I’m not clever enough to get karma the OG way. Holding 86 GME at a 53% loss if it matters...
My mum just accused me of destroying jobs for people at Gamestop. I tried explaining her that that's what we are fighting against. People need to be educated.
This is the main problem of all this. My mum literally came to accuse of destroying jobs while this is the exact thing we are fighting against..   The biggest problem of this thing is that people are uneducated on the matter, this needs to be fixed otherwise they believe all the lies of the mainstream news.   After I explained everything to her she actually changed her opinion of it and tells me to HOLD THE LINE.   She concluded this after seeing the news on Dutch television as well. The manipulation is not only in the US. This is going global and we should stick together as a team to get through this.   I am holding from the Netherlands, what about you?
Side by side until the end!
ARE YOU STILL HOLDING? APES STRONG TOGETHER!  🤲
The shills are pissing in their boots because we won’t sell.
HELP GAMESTOP!!!
Friday feelings
PSA on GME: Why not to sell if you bought in high.
So you went full retard and bought in at $400 a share, huh?  That's too bad but its not over. The classic saying "you only lose if you sell" is 100% correct here.  First off, I'm not advocating to hold for the squeeze as at this point, who know if it will ever be squoze. Until the report comes out next week, its guess work at this point and will only be an educated guess as they'll be old figures when they are released.  I'm holding and I'll be buying more (averaging down) for a longer term investment.  GME 15 @ $240 AMC 40 @ $13  So, what do we know is true?  There's a report coming that will release figures of shorts potentially covered next week.  Everyone's reporting "Game over for GME". Why would that be reported if it were over?  GME have hired Amazon Execs to up its E commerce.  The people have backed GME and AMC. This is massive, you can buy reputational advertising for the billions the hedge funds lost and people will want a piece of the action once this is over. It only increases how viable it is for investment long term.  There memes for this whole escapade were worth the giant red figure thats keeping eye contact with while it takes a massive wank all over my profits.   So please don't be defeatist. It's demoralising seeing a big red in the account but everyone can come back from this.  Grab your bootstraps and average down as much as you can and maybe it will pop, if not, it's looking more and more a viable investment after all this exposure,  so average down keep! And keep investing over the next year and earn those long term tendies!!  Hold, buy more on the dips and see what happens!  God speed you beautiful apes.  Diamond hands baby!       Edit: People need to make their own decisions if they think its a viable investment, im just telling new people why they shouldn't take a massive lost and do their DD. This is not finacial, I'm a retard.
Has anyone thought...
Has anyone thought of the autists who bought at the first peak and can't sell. Sure they were buying 1-50 shares, but we add that to the 6ish Mil who joined the page when the peak happened and we are getting somewhere. If the autists can't sell and the diamond hands are holding. What value can the HF get? Even if they doubled down at 50 or 90. If the price rockers to a small peak, the moon or further, they have the cover thier shorts eventually. I'm only a newbie and a retard ape who bought GME 21 @   If I lose I don't mind. WSB is named that for a reason. I'm truly looking forward to this Tuesday when the report is released. Then all of us dumb dumb apes, will have the answer. Are we dumb or did we just misfire the first time and we are about to hitch a ride on Sputnik. Not financial advice.
How is GME not HTB (hard-to-borrow) according to Webull? CGC has less than 20% short. Holding 8 @ 295 with pending deposit into Fidelity to buy $2000 more
No limits on RH! BUY BUY BUY
Not financial advise, just what I'm doing to get tendies
Don’t let the media fool you. They want to act as if the stocks jumped after RobinHood eased restrictions but a 10% premarket raise doesn’t mean shit when we fell by 40% yesterday. Don’t forget what they did to us. RIP ROBINHOOD. We are shorting your IPO
The next GameStop or researching to find it?
Are there any posts or discussion threads specifically about what will potentially be the next game stock? Or sub groups.  I’d love to stay more update to date on this sub or probs it’s just spending lots of time reading the sub lol.  As the great man says you join at the ‘end of the beginning and leave at the beginning of the end’ ;)
If everyone would follow the posting rules this place wouldn't be such a shit show for the last few weeks.
Posts about buying equities need to be at least $10,000.  Posts about options plays need to be $2500 minimum.  Every other post is "Guyzzz I just yoloed $300 on AMC, emojiemojiemoji."
Will HF try to buy GME price into the ground
Hi all, just had a thought whilst watching GME plummet. What if us buyers/holder    stopped buying today/Monday and let HF drive the value into the ground ($  to $2). Then we buy lots of shares. This will help a lot of people reduce their cost basis. This will have 2 outcomes, either the share     as foretold by the ancient     and everyone has got on board with lots more shares, or the share price recovers to a more natural level and many people manage to negate losses due to low average cost basis.  Thoughts    .?  Title edit  Bury, not buy.  Edit  this is not financial advise and I am clearly retarded.
Time to hold up your end of the deal u/vzxqv_
I do not watch the stock. I set alerts with the mobile app for my broker. Easy breezy.
My opinion is that if one would like to limit their exposure to FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) being induced by market and media manipulation, then they should simply not look at the market or the media, and only be alerted when their action is required.   I have already decided that I'm not selling unless the stock goes to the moon. I have no need to know what the second to second price is.   This is not financial advice.   I am a gorilla with big diamond balls. I walked down the street, talking shit to every wall streeter I saw, with that swag, with that grab-your-crotch swag. My diamond hands and gorilla grip condensed my balls into diamonds. Family jewels if you will. Anyway, I'm retarded. So brain dead am I that I have experienced only equanimity as the price has fallen. As the price falls, so too do my balls, a sign of my growing power.  I believe that we will win, simply on the basis that hedgies don't refer to each other as fucking retards.
It's Payday!!!! More GME for me!
Going to get more GME with my sweet sweet paycheck. 2 more to a grand total of 10 whole shares. Not a lot, but I'm
This looks pretty dead and done to me. Probably would’ve had a gigantic spike instead of the gap in the middle if it wasn’t for restrictions. For those holding, you don’t have to sell, but do move on. Come back in a few years.
Hindenburg Research is another short seller that spews nothing but slander. They need to be punished.
Hindenburg Research is literally the epitome of short sellers and need to be put in their place.  Their information is actual bullshit and they do nothing but hurt companies because of it. Mob assemble?
I just called gamestop's investor relations and the voice box was full you beautiful bastards
They also told me to please HOLD.
Options will be your friends.  Mic drop
120k shares at 450
Whether true or not, what's the next stock this group is making a run at?
is easy if you’ve weathered loss in the past
I started in trading in 2006 with sharebuilder when there was a lot more confusion and less information available. I’ve done my DD and made a lot of good choices, but for every big win, I’ve had big loss. This is just another one of those.  Holding on GME won’t be a problem. I have no plans to sell. I bought it for a long term investment. I’ve got a balanced portfolio. And as my investment in GME and AMC continued to drop over during the week, the portfolio continued gaining.  I’m such a stupid ape I’ve been   🤚 this stupid DFODQ since I bought it at $25 a share in 2017. (Currently .05 per). Not selling.
Keep holding GME!!!
Funny that they’re thinking about us all or a sudden... This is far from over!!!
OK.... WHO IS STILL HOLDING??
Just a warning retards.... whatever happens now/ next week, you can be sure that the hedge funds are benefiting from it. Be careful all...
While we may have struck a blow at the unwitting masters of the universe last week. They have had time to conspire, work out a plan and put it into effect.  Please be careful everyone, we know they will be out to prove a point...
SEC be like...
Just bought another 250 shares, don't let me down today boys
Today's our day.  We got this.  Lets change this momentum.  Make em think twice.  Proof:    Edit:  you're not my mom.  Stop telling me how tl gamble away my money.  Did this site just turn into nothing but a bunch of absolutely crying little bitches?  Holy fuck.  Cry somewhere you soy boy pathetic excuses   jesus.
Reality check
I know you're sick of GME but I want to translate Robinhood for you
Robinhood said:  "We have now removed all restrictions on trading AMC and GME."    which is financial speak that translates to:  "Now that our we and our friends fucked you till we came, you may now proceed to jack off in the corner, enjoy!"
Mango Juul Pods are Back!
Ok but not really but once again, our community held together and endured the face of corruption.  Corporate juggernauts marginalized us,   profiteers sought forth to influence us in hopes to acquire us. The community rallied to support /u/zjz to defend us but circumstances aren't aligned at this time for him to fulfill his duty. He is not a martyr but one of many guardians that oversee now almost 9 million of you. People talk like his bots are what's important. Truth is that it is how much of his life he dedicates to this thankless task that makes him an asset.  How he spends the time getting to know as many of you on a personal level lets you know this sub isn't run by robots but people.     A repeat of history haunted us recently. Some of the mods took risks to make a stand against a repeat. I stood with them because our resolve is unwavering in protecting the integrity of the community. Our moderators are the biggest obstacle for those wanting to take advantage but this story isn't about us moderators. This is another story about you.  We are here for the community, not the other way around. The ones who didn't understand are finally gone. Those of us who remain are left to repair the tarnished culture of moderators past. While temptation became a challenge for them, there is no denying their past contributions. We wish them the very best.       There have been many opportunists popping up everywhere pretending they /r/wallstreetbets. From fake merch to fake discords, fake social media accounts, and subreddits. If it's not linked here, it does not officially represent the subreddit.  They say that imitation is a form of flattery. Clout chasing is for clowns.             So how are things different?  We hope to change the way we do things internally, getting rid of secretive groups within the ranks and commit to open communication where there was none previously. The mistrust lingers heavily but I'm confident that our goals are aligned and hope this will the basis in which we will heal any wounds.  Any differences will be worked out, not just set aside so that we may remain one cohesive unit in support of the largest community of traders, investors of all ages, and experience. When we help each other, support one another we can all persevere through anything. That how we win.  Winners give off an aura that fuels phenomenal growth in our community as well as our wallets.          This is your story to tell. Don't let them tell it for you.        On behalf of the mod team.     Don't come here to fuck around.  Be here to fuck.
Hopefully retard here: Somebody takes GME private!
This would MAKE the shorts cover (which they will anyways eventually)   Obligatory fucking hold you apes!   Bought at 265 and again at 115.  To the moon.   This is just a guy sitting on his bed thinking about possibilities.  I'm a retard and this is not financial advice, duh.
can u guys stop asking whether anyone is still holding?
Why ask such obvious question when u know everyone is holding?
When Robinhood IPO comes out we should all  SHORT
Vlad screwed us, we can screw him now. Can't wait till RH goes public, so we can all drive him out of business! You choose the hedge funds Vlad, you aren't one of of us!
HOLD APES, WE CAN DO THIS
I’d like to become a monkey and buy gme stock, where can I trade it (non-us)
Trading 212 has a waitlist, robinhood is a no-no, right? I want to fuck with the hedge funds, I don’t care about the profit. Willing to buy 10 stocks.
GME strikes again! Why do we fall apes? So we can pick ourselves up!   🔥
Who bought above $300? Above $400? $450? How are you feeling?
When you struggling at Wharton, I was 20 hours deep in Minecraft, when you were worried about summer internships, I slayed at Fortnight. As you studied economics, I studied the blade. You read the Journal, I scrolled Reddit. We are not the same. GME to the MOON THIS DAY
WHO IS STILL HOLDING?   🏻 CAUSE WERE GOING ON A TRIP IN OUR MAGIC ROCKET SHIP
GOING THROUGH THE STARS, LITTLE RETARD
I don't understand stocks but
People are posting that they are holding their stocks, stating that they bought them like when they were 300 ish something. I google GME stocks and I see that they are at 50 ish.   What I'm not getting here? People are hopping that the same meme wave comes over like in some days again? Out of nowhere?  Wasn't the point of holding the stocks keeping them at the same or higher prices? They are decreasing everyday. please someone clarify a noob like me.
Super retard here. Options or straight stonk?
Say I have $200 buckaroonies   I want to add fuel to the    Should I be buying options? If so at what asking price and what expiration date?  Still using RH like a true reeree but I'm down to yolo more but I don't know the exact specifics.   A couple months ago I made thousands yoloing stupid options but the app doesn't explain the breakdown like it did before.   Help I have 17 kids I need to feed.
Michael Burry please testify
Did Robinhood log anyone else out of their account this morning?
Hey Everyone, I've had Robinhood for a couple years now and for the first time since I've had it, it has auto logged me out of my account this morning. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the kind of shenanigans they'd pull on the day that the short squeeze is going to happen. Did anyone else get logged out of their account too?
Actual DD posted in r/options by u/sfjetsetter about how price dip is caused by paper hands OR it's being lowered through Hedge Fund Options trickery
I know you guys are probably sick of hearing GME related stuff but I really wanted to post this here to get some additional thoughts/feedback from experienced investors.  Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing.  TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.  There’s an insightful piece on   that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.  First way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.  \ \   Quoting from Tradesmithdaily:  Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.  \ \   However the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”  \ \   To now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:  The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.  The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.  The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can  .  The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:    If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.   A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.   The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.   This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.   As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.   The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.  It gets very complicated, very fast.  But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.  Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:   “Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position. ”  \ \   In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”, which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares (  about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.  These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions that they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.  Separately but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated 113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice.  For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached    \ \   Excerpt:  The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.  Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):   S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.  it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)  So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) =   is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.  Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade "longs whose shares were borrowed away to short") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 =    That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.  \ \   Many have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3’s part. It’s interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved much at all ( , which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don’t have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.  With the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment   and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity  If you'd like to read more into the subject here are more solid posts that are related to this subject that I recommend you check out:
Please don't downvote this. I feel that people really need to read & understand this for the future. TL;DR $GME was up over 5,000% and while everyone was waiting for the moon, you all ignored the fact that it was all the way to Mars.
I've been lurking in this sub for over a week. This stock was over $300 and everyone was standing strong and "HOLDING THE LINE   " waiting for the moon with no actual exit strategy or real definitive concept of where the moon actually is. You guys took a stock of a company in a dying industry with a market cap of under $1bil, inflated it to $40b, and still were waiting for the moon. What would happen if it hit $1,000? I doubt everyone would post "WE HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON, EVERYONE GET OFF NOW!" Everyone would still be saying DIAMOND HANDS MOOOON HERE WE COME like puppets while the millionaires are silently cashing out.  Why can't people accept the simple fact that a 5,000+ percent increase in a borderline worthless stock IS LITERALLY MILES BEYOND THE MOON? A lot of people got in at $300 so maybe they didn't get to experience the take off from Earth, but you need to realize how cheap the stock was just weeks ago. I saw some people say that the stock could go up to $5,000 which is literally impossible. How can anybody even think that a subreddit can drive a company up from $1 billion to $500 billion? That would make it a top 10-15 company in the world... a company with a dying future. That is not even remotely possible.  The reality is that most of the big boys will always be selling the stock at the top while you all hold the line. You all work together to drive the stock price up, but also ignore the fact that if it takes all of you to drive the stock up to $400, it's going to crash once everyone decides to cash out and MANY of you will be left without your retirement funds. In order for the stock to even go from $350 to 400, people have to keep buying at those high prices. But if even 10% of you start selling off, all of those people who bought in late will get fucked. You guys cannot all profit no matter how hard you work together.  Please do some real due diligence and understand what you are investing in for the future, and ALWAYS have an exit strategy.  I am not a financial advisor. I just want you guys to NOT be retards with your own real money.
GME gave but took it all away. 5K > 100K >6K less gooooo
To quote sum 41 - "If divided we stand, together we fall."
If we are to stand a chance in this fight we need to stop bickering amongst each other and unite against our common foe.   I tend to only see the best in people and because of that I'll keep holding since I expect you all to do the same for me.  After all a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link.    For those of you that can't read so good: Many    +    = ∞💪
Reposting as a post because y’all are killing me
This forum has never been one for kind, empathetic, and sympathetic advice. It was never an investment forum.... it was a casino. To be clear it’s rather annoying seeing all the new GME people in here crying that people were mean to them and crying about their losses. Did any of you actually scroll the Reddit and see what you were joining? Clearly you didn’t. Now there are 7 million plus new people trying to turn this into r/investments or some together we stand stock movement lol. Have you been to Vegas? Nobody dries your tears or gives you financial advice when you lose it all at the black jack table.   You jumped on a train with a bunch of degenerate gamblers ... many of which never told you that they actually have real investment portfolios outside of their gambling money that they manage much more cautiously.
Y’all wanted loss porn?
Well you retards finally convinced me - buying shares in GME right now
I eat crayons

The  shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs —  meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as  sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of  the options trade.   This  works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer,  the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked  shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under  the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect  themselves when facilitating options trades.   As  a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls  was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic  share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but  wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the  other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker,  so the market maker can hedge.   The  hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought  back” their short position via buying long shares — except they  actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out  against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the  maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they  bought from the hedge fund.  It gets very complicated, very fast.  But  the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like  they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and  can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that  exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked  shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation  (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.  Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:   “Trader  A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling  deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call  sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the  broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that  resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the  circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering  shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position. ”  \ \   In  short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short  positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because  the shares were never properly located”, which triggers alarm bells when  we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver  Shares (   about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to  actually find them with the implication they could not be located.  These  factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered  but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using  options, in order to “cover” short positions that they shouldn’t have  had to begin with because shares were never properly located.  Separately  but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday  reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a  day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed  therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated  113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this  new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122%  short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding  synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against  standard practice.  For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached    \ \   Excerpt:  The  real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure  is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain  everything.  Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):   S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.  it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)  So,  by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares  (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100,  short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs  whose shares are borrowed) =   is, the normal way we define short %  would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.  Knowing  this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short %  of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short  of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side  of the trade "longs whose shares were borrowed away to short") is 55/45  as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the  normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 =    That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.  \ \   Many  have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3’s part. It’s  interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated  most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved  much at all ( ,  which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short  percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated  by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that  is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of  55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on  Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I  cannot conclusively say as I don’t have the evidence to conclusively  make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all  other data points.  With the  possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if  you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would  recommend you to follow instructions from this comment    and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an  emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as  calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all  synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds  participating in fraudulent activity  If  you'd like to read more into the subject here are more solid posts that  are related to this subject that I recommend you check out:
Another potential short squeeze coming for $GME?
With all the hype for GME outside wsb dying out, it appears that   Retail    are jumping on hedgies train, buy more and hold! Force them to cover their shorts!  This isn’t financial advice, I am a autist that likes stonk.
It will all come down to 9th of February.
Its my personal opinion and its not financial advice. But when the data will be released and we will see if the stock is still shorted or not the only thing for sure is that whatever the outcome from the data will be its gonna be a bloodpath to the top or to the bottom. I will just hold with all of you like a true retard.
I’m using crayon so you retards need to pay attention. I’m serious, you guys. Let’s get that emergency board meeting goin.
If the average volume on gme is 130 mil on only webull and rh combined. Can someone tell me how the shorts weren't covered?
I see these complicated equations and explanations people are coming up with as to how they weren't covered. The volume being traded on a daily basis is absolutely high, no questions. To see people claiming not enough volume to cover the shorts is sad at this point. You guys really think these hedge funds are stupid.
Seeing a lot of limit sells
AMC has dipped a little and it looks like the pressure is getting to people. I haven't been able to put in much but I feel like the media hype decline is to blame. If not the coverage, is this the move to make to get out before the loss is too much?
THE FAT CATS HAVE CORNERED THEMESELVES!
Listen up Autists,  Freedom is the highest good. In dark times of history, it was ALWAYS about freedom. Freedom of the masses. Over the last 100 years, it was our freedom - the freedom of the people - that was harmed by greedy fat cats of wall street.  The internet is a tool for free speech and for information flow. In theory, the internet is a network that enables a change from information control to a free flow of information. Because of fake and controlled media, however, the internet is still a place where our freedom is violated - constantly.  The last couple of months, weeks, and especially days showed one thing:    THE FAT CATS ARE SCARED    If entitled fat cats are cornered, they become dangerous. They will try everything to maintain their entitled status quo and keep the "wind of change" from blowing - even if that means BREAKING THE LAW.  This, however, does not change the fact, that they are cornered! The sweet smell of a revolution hangs in the air. And there is NO PLACE where they can go. We got them!  We can do this! We can democratize investing. Power to the people.  The only thing we need to know now:    TIME IS ON OUR SIDE    The second only thing we need to know:    WE GET BIGGER AND THIS IS BIGGER THAN US    We will build a prosperous future for all of our children. We will change the world for good.  So enjoy your day - do something nice. Drink a cup of tea and do not get nervous.    TL;DR: FAT CATS ARE SCARED; TIME IS ON OUR SIDE; THIS IS BIGGER THAN US --> SHORTED STOCKS WILL FLY    WE WILL WIN THE ENDGAME   !!!!!  Of course, this is no financial advice.
Don’t forget to take out the trash after the party
I've gone from heavy Boomer ETF investment to heavy GME Zoomer portfolio. Roth IRA to the MOON!
That's around 4 GRAND for the $389 highs!  Also a bonus from my play money account:     Was in it to go from zero to hero, but hey I can swing from hero to fellow holdier o7
What YouTube streamers do you retards watch?
I know we've all seen dfv's stream by now but it makes me wonder what other streamers are out there that are worth watching?
Lil John say--Brrr dum dum dum, dum da da da da dum 3, 6, 9, stand real fine Move it to you suck it to me one mo time Get low, get low, get low, get low To the window, to the wall To the sweat drop down my balls To all you bitches, crawl To all skee skee, motherfucker All skee skee, goddamn
Who else lost so much that they now won’t ever sell
Is this “private capital” from the same people that told RH to suspend $GME at the most crucial moment so we couldn’t buy anymore?
Bought a put with all of my gamestop earnings. If you can't beat em, join em.
HOLD UNTIL HEARINGS FEB. 18
I posted this yesterday but it bears repeating - hold until DFV testifies. The hearings are set for February 18. If you can afford to hold, then hold. If you want to buy, buy whatever you can afford.   There have been mentions that there needs to be an event for this to really take off and this could be it.   It doesn’t matter what will happen at the hearings. The media blowing this up is what got us up. There’s no reason to believe it won’t happen again come Feb. 18.         APES       TOGETHER      STRONG
Scientifically proven reasons why I believe GME is going    to the moon.🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕
They just hired a guy from Amazon! Once the ladder attacks stop the stock is going up to $500, probably will stabilize around $2000. I bought in at $400 x 5000 shares but I'm not selling cause I'm not a paper hand bitch.        Now all I gotta do is figure out how to pay off all these maxed out credit cards and high interest personal loans.
Earnings before the bell today, Friday 2/5
Me holding onto AMC and GME  🏻‍♀️
Fuck you reddit, there is no gold train why do you endorse this shit
I just like this stock

Ethics / legality of social media triggered momentum trading
To my brethren imbicils-  We are using mass emojis and questionable DD to proliferate sentiment about a particular ticker.    Subsequently, as intended or not a large change in volume on that stock has occurred.   Legality  What legal implications exist for the individual, moderators and/or the platform (WSB) participating in such activity?   Ethics  Inherently, I do not think what occurred here is unethical behavior.  However, I do think that we should closely examine the intentions of those proliferating sentiment on an exponential scale.  If they're doing it because they want to profit off of manipulating the masses (evil) then they might perform the same exact actions as someone who genuinely just likes GameStop (good) and doesn't want to see them ruined by hedgehogs.   Do hedge funds do the same things though?  What are their intentions?    What are you apes thinking?   Edit: removed redundant paragraph
Retards, we're beat Elon to Mars.
Robinhood has removed restrictions, and you are free to soar higher than any bird has ever flown. We're going to the clouds, no, we're going to the moon. No, further, to the stars... Retards we're beating Elon to Mars. AMC and GME are low, so   BUY while you can  , and buy a lot. It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but it's gonna be great. So buy your shares and buckle down, because the   rocket is soon to launch   (again). We may be small, but together we are   strong  , and can suck the big monies dry, while also getting great   gains  . Who doesn't want a little sweet taste of green?
Can we all agree that this GME/WSB movie is gonna be trash?
A bunch of Redditors spamming "      " from their mom's basement, screaming "HOLD" every time an eccentric billionaire drunkly tweets about them.  I cannot wait to see Hollywood's latest teen heartthrob unironically mumbling the mantras "apes together strong" and "to the moon" whilst holding his dick during a Mark Cuban AMA or how Vlad pays off the studios to write him into some loveable rogue that's only trying to "dO tHe RiGhT tHiNg". I wonder what they're gonna use as a substitute for the word "retard" ... my money is on "loser".  And what will the finale be? DFV, sat in court, wearing a headband and an ill-fitting suit, explaining the true strength of people power opposite Alec Baldwin who'll play a disgruntled but morally redeemable SEC agent.  HE JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND, GUYS! GIVE HIM TIME, HE'S AN OLD DOG .  It'll probably end with the text "if we work together anything is possible" plastered across the screen with the narrator saying "oh yeah, and if you're wondering, Keith, Keith did get his bucket of much deserved tendies". Final shot of some discarded tenders. Fin.  Jesus, I mean, you think you lost money? Watch what happens when the producers realise that their target audience will be watching through a putlocker link.
At least we're not this guy. I want to see this retard's loss porn.
POSITIVITY BACK   DEFENDED COUP   RESTRICTIONS LIFTED   LETS GO

GME added to the short sale restriction list again. We may see it go up today. Just remember    hold!
WHO’S HOLDING AND BUYING MORE GME AMC
If $GME goes to the moon, I WILL REMOVE 2 RIBS SO I CAN SUCK MY OWN DICK  🍆
(For all the newbies) Here's one of the first lessons you'll learn trading
I know a lot of you are new here and are probably holding on to GME or/and AMC with your diamond hands and just saying fuck it to the losses while waiting for GME to reach 1000.  Here's the thing, as much as it hurts to think about it, the truth is the GME gain train has long passed. It's over. Many of got in the trade at the top. It happens sometimes. The best thing you can do is learn from the experience and limit your losses.  Stop making trading decisions based on hope and feeling and be fucking realistic. Many of you can't actually afford to lose what you invested. And even if you can, there 1000 other more solid investment opportunities out there than GME now.  TLDR: Learn to cut losses and find other gain opportunities.
Anyone else locked out of their Etoro account?
Just tried to log in and it keeps saying error occurred. Tried to log a complaint but it said error occurred. They already pulled some sketchy shit with GME so I don’t trust them on this. Anyone else having difficulty getting into their account?
Down $120,000 since Thursday. No idea what's going to happen. Holding just to find out.
Didn't realize at first that Daddy Elon was testing WSBers
STOP EXPOSING YOUR LOSSES AND POSITIONS. THEY ARE USING THIS AGAINST US!!!!!!!!!!
Guys we need to stop posting loss porn. Stop exposing your positions. Do not expose your limit sell orders either. This is how they calculate the positions. Please keep it to yourself. That is a very important rule, not just in trading but in any hustle. As Biggie said. Never let another player no how much dough you hold. The less they know, they less ammo they have to fire against you.
eHealth EHTH set for a comeback
Been watching and throwing some money at eHealth the past week. They had a nice dip to buy and are up 9% as of yesterday. Company hovered around ~$80 a share and are currently below $60. I bought at $49 so hoping for a rise back to $80+! Keep an eye on it!
Mark Cuban on CNBC: “On Friday we’re going to see a reckoning. The Wall Street guys I know are planning for losses on Friday because the math is starting to turn. The momentum is starting to turn again.”
So how low do you guys think GME will get?  🤚 🤚
So i have 4 shares right now and will HOLD TILL I FUCKING DIE. 🤚 🤚. But I want to get the max shares I can with what limited capital I have available now that my paycheck came.  I'm thinking of buying when it gets down to $20? But I don't want to buy too late obviously. What do yall think?  Wanna send this bitch to the mooooooooonnnnn!!
Buying the dip 📉
Me who bought one share of GME at 300 during the hype and holding.
I see a lot of red but thats only because red is the color our rockets are painted
German Broker flatex/degiro is giving out Free Trades as a response to the happenings of last week. Translation in Comments. $GME orders going out!
Not sure how true as I don't use RH, but it's interesting either way
A Sobering Reflection On The GME Saga
A Sobering Reflection As The GME Saga Settles  With last week’s craze of GME is starting to settle, I wanted to write down some of my thoughts and learnings as someone relatively new to this. I initially intended for this to be a way for myself to reflect, but at the end of writing I thought why not share it if it means it could help someone in a similar situation. This post may be quite long so get comfortable, but first, a little background…  I’d like to think of myself as your average newbie investor, a recent newcomer to the game with no previous experience of investing since it was never taught to us at school. Being 24 years old with a steady job I manage my day to day finances closely ensuring a good amount of disposable income that I can use as I see fit with a good chunk of it split to ensure a comfortable future. Over the past couple of years I’ve racked up a decent amount of savings and even had a savings pot for some “on the whim” purchases, but amongst lockdowns and towards the end of last year my need for spending was at it’s lowest, which is exactly the point where I was targeted with advertising for all sorts of investing apps that made it out how easy it is to make my money work for me.  So I thought, why don’t I make my money work for me?  I was cautious setting off at first, only putting in a small chunk of my “on the whim” savings to buy some stocks in companies that I was familiar with; British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, and a Vanguard S&P500 ETF. While they might not have been the most optimal picks, they were ones that I was at ease with knowing that my money would be relatively safe with potential to rebound from the lows of the pandemic. I committed to putting in a set amount each month into my investment account and slowly growing my portfolio.  I did want to educate myself more though, was I doing the right thing? Were these stocks ones that were going to make my money work for me?  Of course, I hit up Reddit and quickly found subs like r/Stocks, r/Investing and r/UKPersonalFinance. This is the point where I was truly overwhelmed with information and how to set up my investment portfolio to suit my goals. It was welcoming to see how many people there were willing to help, but it seemed like for every suggestion made there was a contradiction to it, after all I wanted to have the best portfolio that would guarantee me a millionaires retirement… A feat I quickly found out was not as easy as some made it out to be.  From that point on I was glued to my trading app and Reddit, my screen on time during the day went from a couple of hours to a distressing 10 hours at its peaks. I was changing my portfolio every couple of days and I will admit that I was addicted to seeing green across all my stocks. The moment a stock started dipping into the red I would sell it and look for the next “Hot” opportunity, sometimes changing stocks multiple times in one day. I was day trading without knowing what that even was yet.  This is where r/WallStreetBets comes into play, a sub that I stumbled across when it spilled over into conversations on the other investing forums, it so happened that I joined just at the time when Palantir was getting all the hype and was still under $20. So many people liked this stock and after reading some of the posted DD I thought to myself, hey this seems like a good thing to put into my portfolio and balance it out with a high risk high reward investment. So I bought a few shares at around $18 and after only a couple of days I saw it grow rapidly like I haven’t seen from any of my stocks before, I was hooked! Before I knew it my “on the whim” savings pot read $0, and I tripped down on my stocks in Palantir. After all, the stock was going to $300 right?  For the next couple of days I felt like I was the next warren buffet, my first 50% gain in only a few days was an exhilarating feeling… Which was quickly followed by a week of the stock going downwards. This was the side of investing that I had not experienced yet, I saw my gains vanishing every day but was reassured by the fact most considered this a healthy pullback. I thought to myself, what if this is the start of the bursting bubble everyone is talking about? So I sold my positions right at the $22 dollar mark which was exactly the point it started to make a recovery. I can’t lie, I was pretty annoyed with myself but nonetheless I took my profits and promised myself to do better next time.  The next few weeks throughout December I took time to research companies, do my due diligence, and invest in businesses I would be comfortable holding when those red days come. So I assembled my first portfolio which I was genuinely proud of consisting of; Etsy, Pintrest, Curiosity Stream, Romeo Power, Arrival and Apple - collectively these stocks took a 75% share of my portfolio with none taking more than a 15% stake on their own - I split the remaining 25% into two ETF’s; ICLN, and VWRL.   This is the point where I left my portfolio as it was for the longest period without any day trading - I repurposed the time I used to use staring at my trading app into reading “The Intelligent Investor” which made apparent to me the mistakes that I made in the past with entering and exiting positions. I got about half way through the book when I started to notice the Gamestop trend coming along with people saying that this is the next hot thing…  Sure I believed that there was money to be made, but after getting burned with Palantir I was cautious of investing into a very high risk but high reward stock until I was much more knowledgeable. Besides, the money pot of expendable savings has run dry so I couldn’t fund my journey to the moon anyway. That was until I got tipsy one night and saw that the stock had gone up 200%, I thought to myself, why don’t I take a chunk of my house savings and put them into the stock? If it was to go up, say, another 200% we could be in such a better position to buy our first house soon and we would even have some money spare to treat ourselves to something nice!   I woke up the next morning, realising how stupid that idea would have been and dismissed the thought as I watched the stock climb to almost $500 a share over the next couple of days - that could have been my house deposit I thought to myself again. Then came the first pitfall of a dip and I thought to myself that it was for the best that I gave it a miss, could I have trusted myself to get out anywhere near the top? Or would I have crashed out again right at the bottom. Similarly to Palantir, I did not see the hype dying down at all - is this a pullback just like what happened when I crashed out of my first risky investment? Surely the stock will go to $5000 next right?  I drew up on my house savings and decided to put a chunk into Gamestop on the way up from the $190 dip, ultimately, I could put that money straight back after I make my gains so what’s the worst that could happen, I thought to myself. I got in at around $300 and felt amazingly confident at close with the stock rising to $330, onwards and upwards from here boys!   I was again glued to my trading app, researching the short % and the pre/after market price fluctuations. Monday was where it started to go wrong but I was feeling confident that it was another dip and it was time to load up before take off. Fuck it, let's sell my ETF’s, who wants a “boomer” portfolio anyway, so off they went and straight into Gamestop. Tuesday took me by surprise but “look at the way the VW short squeeze happened” - god I wish I could have told myself to shut up here, but no, that was my mentality and I went ahead and sold some of my core positions to further average down into GME.  Wednesday was just a game of watching my investment tumble off of a cliff, and today came the sobering thoughts after realising what I gave into, which stood against everything that I built up since beginning my journey with investing. This has lead me to spill my words out here, with my Gamestop shares at $247 average. I take this as quite an expensive lesson, but I am very thankful that it is one that will only set me back some months on my savings, and not completely ruin me financially for the foreseeable future.   My plan? Well I either take my losses here which I really see no point in being -80% down on my investment. So I plan to go back to my original method; leave the shares as they are for now, do some due diligence of my own on Gamestop, see what the company has planned for in the future and if it is worth averaging down in for a very long term investment. Remind me in 5 years I guess?  The hardest part of coming to terms with what has happened was definitely the amount of people labelling others in a similar situation as being holders, and the constant mocking of GME shareholders from some people on this sub. I certainly don’t like to take things personally but it did get to that point, I wanted to prove everybody wrong and in believing that the stock would skyrocket I was only lying to myself. So the next time you see someone in a similar state to where I was blindly chasing a dream, offer them some words of advice, don’t shit on their dreams just because they can’t see a way out at the moment. Some people have gambled away much more than I have here but that is no reason for them or their intelligence to be made fun of, we’re all here for the same reason and we should all have each others backs both when it comes to gains or losses.  Hopefully I was able to put across how quickly things can fall apart just because of our desire to improve our current lifestyle as quickly as possible and I don’t think that any one can be blamed for wanting to do this when GME was so widely hyped. For those of you who are still reading, thank you for taking the time to do so, my inbox is open if any of you would like to reach out, I am not a financial advisor nor a therapist but I am always happy to chat with anyone who just needs to get something off their chest.

The spirit here is completely different today
Ever since the plummet of GME, bad mods trying to take over and bots spamming with demoralizing agendas, it’s nice to see that people are still holding up against it. The bad mods are also mostly gone, and i feel like the entire spirit has been a lot better today than the last couple of days, and that i just appreciate. It has been, it is and it will continue to be an honor to hold with you apes  .  But listen retards, we still have something they want, that’s just the reality. Soon it will be our time to launch an attack (keep fucking buying, there’s a huge fucking sale). We just have to be patient. Another weekend is upon us, and as someone said last friday: turn of your phone, get some fresh air and enjoy it. The stonks will still be here monday. Fuck reading the news anyway, we already know where they stand in this.  Take care lads, and if anyone wanna play videogames when we arrive on pluto, dm me       .    to 69,420  (Not financial advice, i just like the stock)
Woohoo.. RH removed all restrictions! Let's GO!         🤲 👊
Today should be good. I like this stock.   Not financial advice I am just 🐵 w/  who doesn't know much about stonks.  By the way b4 I get flamed any more... I know RH is shit but it takes a minute to transfer. They are making it purposefully slow as well because they suck so badly.
Why are there so many posts and replies telling people to sell, and realise losses, rather than to simply hold instead?
Does this seem weird to anyone else? this is r/wsb, why so many posts telling people to sell?
You should know about capital loss carry over. Don't be afraid to show your tax preparer your - 90% realized gains!
,for%20the%20beneficial%20tax%20treatment.  >What Is a Capital Loss Carryover? Capital loss carryover is the net amount of capital losses eligible to be carried forward into future tax years. Net capital losses (the amount that total capital losses exceed total capital gains) can only be deducted up to a maximum of $3,000 in a tax year. Net capital losses exceeding the $3,000 threshold may be carried forward to future tax years until exhausted.   There is no limit to the number of years there might be a capital loss carryover.
WHO IS STILL HOLDING???🤑💪
Is DFV still holding?
I’m still holding!! 🪐
IM STILL HOLDING
Im definitely not holding enjoy ur losses normies
I appreciate what you all are doing. I really do. But do you have to use the word “retard” so much? I get the whole, “well that’s how we’re viewed” mentality but I just think there is a less gauche way of being tongue-in-cheek about your sub’s approach.

Rock bottom is the bedrock from which every good thing was ever built - I promise you, my autistic brothers, it is only up from here. Buy, hold, and believe.
So would you say that Citadel/Robinhood were manipulating the market by limiting share buying and causing GME, NOK etc to fall?

THIS IS WHY JOURNALISM IS A FUCKING JOKE. NO ONE VERIFIES SHIT!
Through this GME endeavor, most people overlooked one problem
We fucked with the upper echelon's money.  They put their millions and billions in the trust of HFs.  Then certain people realized some HFs made a miscalculated bet.  Then the rest of us normies piled in, seeing the same problem.  I forget who mentioned it, but when we were usually playing with their crumbs, they knocked over the whole fucking loaf two weeks ago when GMC closed north of 60 and every call was ITM.  Three days of green dildos, love of a stock, and hurting billionaires was not going to last forever, so the CEO of NASDAQ suggests a need for HFs to "recalibrate" for this environment.  The next day, normies are recalibrated to not even have additional access to the product (all while the upper levels could still ~~trade~~ recalibrate.)  The following day, we're slowly reintroduced to the product with limited access.  We get to 325 at close on Friday and celebrate, all the whole shares get worked back to 313.  A week removed and we look around with those restrictions gone.  The hands are still diamond, the apes are still strong, we still like the stock, but we must be punished in the meantime.  Say this sub caused all this chaos and upheaval.  Say we're chasing other short candidates that are short less than 100%.  Say we're chasing some digital dog.  Say we're pumping silver.  Say we need SEC investigation.  Say we need disbanding (makes for a good story line, book version may be better than the movie.)  Enough noise from thousand dollar suits on camera deemed to be reputable, mixed with a few targeted ads, SM  , and reposting of articles, and now we don't control the narrative.  We were winning at a game they accidentally let us play for longer and deeper than intended.  WSB must be sacrificed to the    alter.  We know our brethren are stuck at a higher price or may be sitting on a deeper loss, but we remain resolved in purpose.  Perhaps one day, Alpha Centauri, but for now, we're trying to escape the gravity of our situation.  There will be little to no justice for the true bad actors, for they are part of the cogs that turn our economic wheel.  And again, we fucked with  their  money, so why should  they  care?  A business decision was made to be fined millions at a later date than lose a couple more billion in one bad trade, of which we will see little of that settlement.  The upside?  This will happen again.  So long as someone is trying to eek out a little more alpha, there will be another chance to jump on a billion dollar mistake (in your favor.)  They're won't be any new regulations because, face it, those HFs have some congressional bucks in them and enough clout on K Street to keep their system going.  Can't say where and when, but if you find it early, you're looking at some deep fucking value.  Should someone else point it out to you, chances are you're late to the party and should dial back your expectations a little.  And, perhaps next time, we take a little off the table when we're up, or maybe just step back when everyone else offline sounds like an expert on the subject.  It's been a helluva a ride and bumpy as shit, but that's the market.  But you're above terra firma, and that next opening bell for the world's largest casino is just around the corner.  Perhaps Melvin & company is still short or even reshorted, or a whale could come in and acquire a bulk of the outstanding shares.  We can dream big while grounded in our reality.  As for my 133 shares?  Come and take   not for what Mr. Market says they're worth right now.  #  ️
WSB is becoming more and more of a cult!
You can downvote me all you want, but this past week every post has been about pushing GME, AMC and BB without even listening to any counter arguments.   Even legitimate and well researched DD's have been downvoted to oblivion. While I understand the need to be united we need to make sure that we consider all opinion and not become an echo chamber of self serving narratives.
It ain’t much but it’s honest work. I don’t make much so still clenching my cheeks
Evidence pointing to shorts did not cover pretended they did (via options) to break the squeeze
Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing. (This is a re-post, if you previously saw this I would appreciate an upvote for visibility. The previous post got a lot of traction but was removed a mod. I spoke to mod on the team after and he kindly agreed to approve it.)  TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.  There’s an insightful piece on   that identifies there are two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.  First way is retail investors not holding the line and panic selling thereby driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.  \ \   Quoting from Tradesmithdaily:  Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.  \ \   However the other scenario where this can occur is the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”  \ \   To now quote verbatim from Tradesmithdaily:  The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.  The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.  The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can  .  The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:    If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.   A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.   The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.   This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.   As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.   The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.  It gets very complicated, very fast.  But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.  Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:   “Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position. ”  \ \   In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”, which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares (  about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.  These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions that they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.  Separately but potentially related, S3 released updated short numbers last Sunday reducing from their projection of short interest from 122% to 113% (a day later on Friday) to 55% on Sunday (while markets were closed therefore in my estimation using the same data set that calculated 113%), which many found to be suspicious. Later it was found that this new number was calculated using the same data set that yielded 122% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of adding synthetic long shares into the short float equation which is against standard practice.  For a more detailed breakdown a user here pasted a good analysis of how those numbers were reached    \ \   Excerpt:  The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.  Here is what they did:Sources (S3 head):   S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.  it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)  So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) =   is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.  Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade "longs whose shares were borrowed away to short") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 =    That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.  \ \   Many have pointed out this could be manipulation on S3’s part. It’s interesting to note that as late as the Jan 29th, Ihor from S3 stated most GME shorts have not covered and net shares shorted hadn't moved much at all ( , which was confusing to many as this was a big discrepancy in short percentage in a short time. It turned out this percentage was calculated by including synthetic longs into the equation which is a practice that is not standard, thereby yielding a lower short interest percentage of 55% which the media then bandied around before and during market open on Monday. Whether this involved collusion to harm the retail investor I cannot conclusively say as I don’t have the evidence to conclusively make that claim, but definitely something to consider along with all other data points.  With the possibility of Synthetic Long Shares being used in a fraudulent way, if you care about how this could play out if we force the issue, I would recommend you to follow instructions from this comment   and call or email Gamestop Investor Relations and ask them to call an emergency share holder meeting to save the company from bankruptcy, as calling this vote means calling shares back to owners eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from short selling funds participating in fraudulent activity  If you'd like to read more into the subject here are more solid posts that are related to this subject that I recommend you check out:
Fucking listen up retards. If I see one more God damn post about diamond fucking hands with no fucking skin in the game. Post your positions or BAN. THATS RIGHT. Ban every fucking shrill without proof!
When to walk away
Guys if you think the squeeze didn’t happen already you need a reality check. I have been apart of this sub for a year. Check my account. You need understand that you lost and it’s okay just take what you have left and play again in a new stock thats been the way here forever. But please for the love of god stop hoarding this sub Reddit with gamestop Q-anon shit. If you hold go ahead but the truth is your money is better working somewhere else unless you truly believe that gamestop will bounce back then go right ahead but if we go by actual stock market knowledge gamestop’s t true value might be $30 a year from now. If you downvote this you are a Q-anon gamestop hopium insane person and there is nothing denying it
Most of you that are holding GME now, and are holding, thinking they would rather lose the money, might very well lose it. Explanation in post.
this is not financial advice  I know this is very hard to digest guys, but please remember that in the markets, you are in for yourself, not for wallstreetbets, not for anybody. There is a saying: there are no friends in wall street.  Holding now, thinking that it will be just like VW in 2008 is insane, the VW dip was caused by shorts! This is why the squeeze in VW even happened.   Short interest in GME is at about 50%, which is not bad, but most of the shorts now are probably shorts that shorted after the original shorters bought back, meaning that these shorts are in the money right now.  Also, GME is recovering a bit as a company, going into ecommerce, getting Ryan on board, but even the current price 60$ is not justifiable for a company such as gamestop.  If you need the money, I would highly suggest you sell, but if you want to be a retard and let your 30%, 40%, 50% loss get into a 90% loss, you might as well do it.  I personally didn't invest in GME, and I am not shorting it right now, but beware of people shaming you for selling "paper hands", "weak hands", don't be shamed into losing your money.  tl;dr: Don't hold if you still want money, the squeeze is done, those with diamond hands are on track to lose money, and if you can be shamed by reddit into holding, you're a retard.
My humble thoughts on GME, WSB, and the future of the stock market
As we all know, millions of lower- and middle-class people around the world were robbed in daylight for hundreds, thousands, and millions of dollars by brokers and hedgefunds.  What was a completely legal tactic by the people was halted and illegally disrupted to the point of possibly no return.  We got mad, rightfully so, and today we continue to watch as GME continues to plummet.  The most saddening thing of all is that GME could fall to $5 tomorrow and nobody would say a damn thing.  No one is going to stand up for what happens to them.  We are all going to resume our lives after losing what could've been life-changing money.  This is why things will never change.  In my humble opinion, at some point we have to say no more.  We have to actually DO something in order for their to be change, but most people would rather take it in the ass then disrupt the comfort of their meager lives.  Personally, I have a family to look after and protect.  So my question to you all: when do we say no more?  What is it going to take?  And what are we actually going to do?  Edit: to clarify I'm still holding
Hello everyone, new guy here for downvotes. Veterans, am I wrong in my analysis? 1-squeeze, 2-media attention, 3-short buy, 4-short sale, 5-panic sales, 6-attempted 2nd squeeze, 7-cutting your losses. The damage was done at step 1, and through 3 & 4 a lot of that money was recovered.
How could AMC's squeeze have possibly been squozen already? There haven't been less than   million stocks shorted at one time, in the past year.

Is the inverse of short ladder attacks possible?
So we've all seem the damage short ladder attacks can do. To be honest I don't fully understand how they work, is it that they sell a small quantity of shares back and forth very quickly between two parties on repeat for a smaller and smaller price?   Why couldn't a different hedge fight it by simply buying a small quantity of shares from each other over and over again with a gradually rising price?   I mean yes it's clearly market manipulation, no question however it seems the SEC don't mind so long as it's hedges doing it.
I AM NOT FUCKING SELLING
THEY ARE STILL SHORTING.
In my opinion. I Think the best course of action here is let them plummet the price into the ground. The faster the better. That means they lose interest when its almost worth what ever they think it is. Then we strike. We can buy way more at a cheaper rate. Just like Mark Cuban said. We need Volume. We will obtain that by buying cheap. This is exactly what we needed. Also more interest from the avg buyer at a cheaper rate. Nuff said. Shhhhhhh
Where's all the GME loss porn?
Shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that the GME train has long sailed (sorry bagholders, but if you still haven't exited i dunno what to tell you)  With that said, where's all the glorious loss porn? Surely there are like hundreds of thousands of people that FOMO:ed in at 400+.     Position: Completely out (Bought at 16, 35 and 87, sold at 270)

Chamath Palihapitiya-backed Clover Health gets notice of SEC investigation

As of now the AMC shares are about $  when im typing this. For days Wall Street has been houding us, battering us with attacks from the markets and the dogs mouth of the media. We stood firm, not selling and still buying AMC shares when they "Bought and Sold" within seconds of them doing so to lower the price. I've never seen such a hive of scum and villainy in all the universe before I saw what Wall ST. could really do.   As of last night AMC went on the SSR (Short Sale Restriction) list, or funnily enough SEC Rule 201. I can't explain it properly so go to this link here for more info ->    What I can gather is that because AMC dropped to such a low price,  people now can't short it like they've been doing all this week. So this is a big bonus for us. The second bonus is that a lot of American citizens, apes and tendie thrashers have been paid last night, so people will be buying en masse to grt on this train. Third bonus, AMC Theatres are to open from this weekend across America, so if you can go out and enjoy a film to ENJOY THE STOCK. Buy what you can that isn't going to bankrupt you, and let the show commence again.  BE AWARE that the MM such as the NYT / WSJ / Motley Fool etc. , are trying to downplay AMC and it's value. Ignore it. AMC has a massive volume, potential and growth. I'm not a financial advisor, I just really appriciate the stock and it's value to me.

Mirroring of AMC and GME
Over the last few days, it had solidified to me that AMC and GME trade exactly the same, even in after-hours. For reasons I do not understand why it trades this way. Both are meme stocks and are among the most popular stocks on WSB but those reasons alone shouldn't be enough to morph into this.  Hy who two stocks in different sectors, prices point,  news, trade nearly identical to each other?  I notice when a large infusion on one stock was posted, both would benefit. Would like to hear a different perspective on this matter.        TLDR: can someone smarter than this retard tell me why they move the same way? Every time i see a baller dropping a big bag of changes into GME, both jump. wth? Are there equally smaller baller out there droping equally smaller bag of change into AMC at the same time, every time?
What happened with BB and AMC?
Is somebody still interested? I saw at the beginning of the week that those two were going to be big and I see since then how they've plummeted like crazy.  And no, I did not invest there I'm just interested

What if the broker restrictions backfire on the shorts?
So, I am a long-time WSB lurker and low-functioning autist with an idea I wanted to share.     In my understanding, a squeeze started on 26 JAN and the hedge funds started to hemorrhage cash at an alarming rate. They had no choice but to pull out all their dirty (read: illegal) tricks to avoid the full squeeze so they got RH (and all the shitty brokers) to limit buys so they could get price down and do some covering.  At that time a lot of the  🤚 who bought in late folded as they were going to anyways (no hard feelings to them, to each their own), leaving them with the realized loss and only leaving the  🤚 standing. Although some shorts were covered, it seems like there were other short sellers waiting to jump in. So, in theory, maybe Melvin did bail (at a multi-billion loss) and the next hedgie asshole stepped in to short.  Here's the thing though, the   broker restrictions actually did block a lot of us from buying in more at the peak thus leaving us with more ammo to buy in now  . I was late to the game, and a very small fish in the pond, but most of my position was purchased after restrictions were lifted.  It seems like the hedge funds planned on playing the long game assuming they can scare us into selling but I think   we're in for the longer game  . The way I see it:       I am happy to hold an unrealized loss if it's still costing some asshole who's still shorting   Even if  🤚 did hand some of the money back, it's very clear hedge funds did eat big losses already and that feels good   Who knows what the real short interest really is, but I've got all the time in the world to wait and see if there is still a squeeze to be squoze   We protected the company from bankruptcy and retail employees from Wall St. predators   Happy to give the new CEO a chance to turn around the company of my childhood   Feels good to be a part of a populist uprising of sorts against these assholes   Hoping we get something out of this, like more decentralized financial infrastructure     For those of you who bet your retirement on this, I wish you luck! I will be among the many holding strong for the long-long game, you can count on us.     5 GME @ 125   Not a financial advisor, just like the stock.

My letter to GameStop Investor Relations
Did a spin on what was offered by others. Thought I’d offer. This would potentially speed up changes to the board.  Hi, My name is xxxxxx. I live in xxxxxxx and I currently own approximately ####### shares of GameStop. I also am a recent PowerUp Member who joined to show my support of Ryan Cohen. I am very excited by his vision of the company as well as the three recent additions to GameStop. My family are also long time, loyal Chewy customers.  I am concerned by the recent market activities to restrict the rights of current and potential GameStop investors. It is quite apparent that brokerage firms and clearinghouses have taken actions that are damaging to shareholders. I request that an emergency shareholder vote be held to accelerate the changes to the board and nominate Ryan Cohen as the chairman of the board.  I would also ask the Board to address the potential fraud occuring in the market and identify legal strategies in consultation with the SEC to eliminate potential naked short selling and synthetic long shares. It is unacceptable that companies are trying to bankrupt GameStop. I believe it is the Board's responsibility to protect GameStop shareholders.  Thank you.

From   to 480. Why are people not happy about the gains already achieved.
Granted it was messed up you couldn't buy GME, AMC, etc.. But was a fun ride. Comments alone made it worth the investment.  Note: I only bet what I could loose on the meme stocks, so was fun short ride.  Hopefully majority made $$$.
I don’t see as many ppl posting their loss porn as there should be. Can’t bully me to sell, these  🤲🏼 will HOLD.
Why GME is still a worthy investment
Disclaimer: I am no expert and this is not financial advice; it’s just what I think.   GME is still an incredibly shorted stock and with the buying power we have we can somewhat mimic what we originally did with GME.   If the hedge funds knew they were in the clear and that the squeeze had already happened there wouldn’t be a need for so much market manipulation this week. They are not in the clear yet. They still haven’t covered most of their short positions because some of us aren’t selling. They are trying to drive down the price as much as possible before the 9th when the shots reports are released, so before then we should take this as an opportunity to buy shares at a discount price (only if you can). I reckon the price will go up after the 9th but it’s more likely to do so if we buy up the shares now.  Hedgies are screwed if they can’t buy their positions back before the 9th. Lets make sure it stays that way.  There is 8 million of us. Let that sink in.  Also, though it doesn’t mean much, the after market price is up by $5.

One Thing Billionaires Don't Have: An Ear to the Ground of the American Public- A GME Bull Thesis.
One thing that  billionaires don't have that has been proven time and time again. And that is an ear to the ground of the general public.  This is winded, but worth a read as it's a minority thesis.  I am not a financial advisor, I am not a finance person.  I am nothing more than a low stakes poker player with a mere BA in Economics.  And this is not financial advice.  It's simply my thesis and my play.  I was aware of the theory of GME when it was around $11.  I had no clue if it was real or not. I saw the 140% short.  I honestly thought it was a mistake or something.  After, GME dipped from $20 to $16, I was about to throw a few bucks in and see where the Cohen theory went, and if a squeeze happened great. But, then the capital attack happened and I was concerned and was sitting on 90% cash.  So I pulled to my bank till after Jan 20th.  Then, after I re-deposited and behold, GME is at like $50-60. Well damn, so I felt I had missed the boat.  Then something happened, GME rocketed to $120, and all the talking heads on TV started to squirm, billionaires were on TV comparing reddit to cop killers from the capital attack.  The gears of the elite machine started to turn and I called my buddy and said, you know what, it's real, this mfer is going to moon, their borrowed to the fucking gills, maybe even more than we realize. So I looked at my financial situation and chose an amount to put to work on this and decided to dollar cost avg in.  The next day we got a $73 dip. I was in.   We rebound off $73, and then Elon tweets on a move up when GME was $149, it opens the next morning at $260.  That really sucked Mr. Musk, thanks.   So I have skin in the game and am not prepared to make any more moves after that kind of move up. So I wait and watch.  We get a few small dips and I dip a few more dollars in before this thing moves to the stratosphere.  Still only approx  15% in at this point.  Que GME moving into $400 range.  All the news outlets are starting to talk now, it's on a bunch of stuff, CNBC is trying to ignore it, talking about MSFT moving 3%, trying to ignore the elephant in the room.  Boomers around town start talking about, they are asking me questions about what's going on. But they all say the same   that gets back to around $50, I'm going to buy some.  GME moves toward $500.  The talking heads can't ignore it anymore, the stock market starts bleeding, their pleading with people to stop, the president is getting asked about it, congress is getting in, my dog is fucking watching the TV to see whats about to happen, the super bowl isn't even being talked about amongst gamblers, the whole world is looking at GME, and boomers are asking if they should buy at $500.  And that is when it hit me.  This could crash the economy.  During this move from $260 to $500, I started to notice trends setting in at $360, $330, and $283. It was really struggling to get over the $360 hump, checked the market cap, $22 billion I think.  I told my friend, I don't think the retail guy has enough money.  A guy on CNBC said maybe friday morning, (ok, so they are going to try to crash the entire market, what price do we have to get to?  40 billion?)  So I looked at what GME is at 40 billion, It's $573 if I remember correctly.   So when we were at 22 billion, I asked myself, where is the other half going to come from, it has to be people with cash, and they are terrified of these prices.  Why would they put the majority stake in at $30k for maybe a 100% return, when a guy with $1000 in takes 11,000%.  The avg joe isn't buying this here, it's going to have to crash before it squeezes, if this isn't the squeeze, and these people up big are going to start taking profits.  To my suprise, it breaks into the $500 range, the markets are literally fucking tanking on positive vaccine news as this thing moves toward that $571 number.  I tell my buddy, this is exactly what I said would happen at these prices. So did I sell, hell no, this thing was about to pop.  Then RH happened.  At first, I went conspiracy level shit and thought did they just fucking stop the economy from crashing by doing something illegal, what is this, communist China?  But then it made more sense, people had borrowed on the margin to push it this high that fast, and RH literally wouldn't have the cash to pay these fucking people, which reinforced everything I am thinking at this point.  Friday closes at $320.  The boomers are all talking GME now as a deal at these prices, but their scared, their old, they have to retire soon.  Que Monday morning Silver.  Monday morning Silver squeeze was not "put out there" to divert attention of young people from GME.  It was to divert the boomer to the thing they love most, good old metals.  They pushed an ad   to get boomers to think, we havn't missed out, these youngsters are about to push silver to the moon and even if they don't, metals are safe, metals are good for the boomer retirement. So now all the boomers are talking Silver. And that is when I made adjustments to my dollar cost avg'ng. This thing was going to crash, there wasn't enough money to push it over the top without getting cash holders and boomers in. I am a cash holder they needed, I wasn't coming in at $300, the boomer was not with you, and the profit takers were up huge and the pressure was on them.   So I sold at $325, with the plan to double down on the way down to $60, double again at $60,  and then double again at $50, with hopes that the boomer would see $50 as a chance to get in and we would see a bounce off $50.   They moved the silver market nearly 10% Monday, over a 1 trillion dollar market.  Well now it's today.  And guess what.  Boomers are not talking Silver in the streets, their talking GME at $50, cash holders are not talking AAPL, their talking GME, and gamblers are still not talking about the Super Bowl, their talking GME.  Their talking about feeling like they were lied to by the media about Silver.  They heard Cramer tell Reddit to not go for the grandslam, go for the homerun instead, take your profits.  They know the establishment squirmed and they don't squirm over a lame 20 billion loss.  A curtain was almost pulled back, and a lot of people are sure curious about what was behind that curtain at $573.  And what is wall street doing.  Celebrating.  Enjoying it.  Doubling down on puts.  It's Atlanta 28-NE 7 with 3 minutes to go in the 3rd QT in the Super Bowl.  It's over. The billionaire owner is on the sideline waiting for his trophy.  But what if there is a spark.  A tiny bounce off $50.  A dropped pass that gives the ball back to save a glimmer of hope.  Boomer sees price going back up, gambler sees price moving back up, cash holder sees price moving.  Downside, probably 50%, upside huge.  A buy, then another, momentum maybe?  Probably not, some holders see a new opportunity to bail, price falls, and yet another buying opportunity to open the curtain.  Another buy, another buy, no sellers at these levels, they have had 5 opportunities to bail.  Momentum builds. The news starts talking again, rolling their eyes, people start to think, it's happening.  More come in, process repeats, until there is enough momentum, some profit takers start thinking, what if I am wrong, if I put in 50% profits, I've still got 50%.  And to the moon we go to open a magic curtain with something behind it that makes everyone nervous for some reason.  Or, maybe we just crash to $5.  So what I have been betting on is simple.  Wall Street is amazing at this game. But they are not on the street, they don't have their ear to ground. I believe that they played this perfect, just like I expected them to.  And I am betting they have underestimated this and have doubled down again without the knowledge of the talk on the streets, being around regular people, thinking this forum was their biggest threat, and have in the process overextended themselves in the process again.  Do I think they are still heavily shorted.  HELL YES.  Do I think the economy is at risk.  No.  They likely deleveraged enough to remove that option by reducing some of their own risk.  But another $?bn loss is a lot of tendies to go around.     edit\   Cuban's comments about regrouping, applies here.        TLDR:  WSB and RH not enough money. GME falls to $50.  HF celebrate, HF double down. Boomer no like silver, Boomer like GME. Gambler no like Super Bowl, Gambler like GME.  Cash Holder no like Market, like GME.  GME go BRRRRRRRR again.           Profit taker see new opportunity for         .  HF go bye bye.

I missed round 1 but believe there is a good chance that the short position still hasn't been covered (that it's just camoflagued by options trades), and I want in. I bought some (<1%) at $100 and if it goes much closer to $20 I'm considering putting real skin in the game

Short Volume Ratio Update - 83% AMC       🌕
In the wake of $GME losses, we all need to remember this...
Updated Short Interest Numbers for GameStop (GME) as of Feb 1
The 121% short interest that people keep mentioning is from Jan. 15.     Source:  , date is seen next to the short interest volume.       According to Bloomberg from Feb 1:       >       >Short interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStop’s short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year.         Obviously those are numbers from 2 different market analytics firms so they are not official. NYSE will report official numbers on Feb 9. These Feb. 9 numbers will be the short interest as of Jan. 29 so they won't be as low as the Bloomberg numbers since they're 3 days older (Source:           So, as a summary:           Officially: 121% on Jan 15, new numbers come out feb 9 (but will be the short interest from Jan 29)         S3: 140% mid Jan, 50% as of Feb. 1        IHS Markit: 114% mid Jan, 39% as of Feb. 1          As much as WSB likes to cast doubt on any information against a potential second squeeze, these firms' whole business depends on providing accurate estimates. There is a very good chance the official short interest will be around 39-50%. But note that it may be slightly higher since the data is 3 days older than those estimates.          What does this mean?       Based on the estimates, there is a 60+% decrease in the number of shorts from Jan 15 to Feb 1. This means short-sellers have covered most of their shorts and the chance of another short squeeze occurring is basically 0. If I had to guess, Melvin covered most of their shorts around Jan 26th (which is when it was reported that they covered). This caused the price to go from $88 to $150. The majority of other short positions were covered between Jan 27-29 which explains the drastic price increase to $300+.        According to Reuters:          >        >Short-sellers are sitting on estimated losses of $  billion from their short positions in             >Ortex data showed that as of Wednesday, there were loss-making short positions on more than 5,000   firms.      My prediction makes sense with these numbers. Melvin lost $6 billion and were spared from heavier losses due to how quickly they bought to cover. This demand drove the price up and caused most of the remaining losses.                EDIT:          Here is my response to /u/OverlordHippo's comment about the S3 numbers:        >Except the S3 data was only 54% because they added synthetic longs into their equation this time for (some) no reason. Using the common practice equation it's still well over 100%. If you think Bloomberg is reporting with integrity, well I can't help you there lol       Let's look at the S3 report for Feb 1:       You will see 2 different values for the short interest:        SI % Float           S3 SI % Float      The 53% number is calculated how short interest is typically calculated. S3 did NOT add synthetic longs into this equation.      The   number is the number which includes synthetic longs. The managing director of S3 explains the difference between this two numbers and why this is done back in September 2020:           The confusion about S3 stems from this Tweet from Jan 29:           From Jan 29 to Feb 1, traditional short interest went from   to         And, S3 short interest (the calculation which included synthetic longs) went from   to              People confused the   traditional short interest   of       from Feb. 1 with the   S3 short interest   of       from Jan 29. They thought the traditional short interest used a new calculation when it did not. S3 did NOT change the calculation randomly.
What is the original stock price of Gme?
Thanks It's currently at 53$, so the risk is surprisingly low. Might be a good gamble, if you only lose 3-40$.
Should you buy GME at market price or with limit?
Kinda new to this whole thing, help would be appreciated
Cut beers to cut bears this weekend
Life advice not financial advice but I drink too much so instead im gonna drive and allocate to stonks instead of shots.   Thanks external motivation!
Why not simply move on to the next shorted stock and hype it through the roof?
Hear me out. GME allowed us to bankrupt some hedgies and bleed them out of literal billions. Why is it imperative to squoze the squeeze when we can just start hyping the next shorted stock?      Holding GME is fine, but it shouldn’t stop us from taking other positions. Am I missing something here? Let’s hype again!
Is everyone forgetting that the Volkswagen squeeze took months to reach its squeeze?
Seriously, too many people are saying the squeeze is done or that it's happening next week. Volkswagen didn't reach its all time top in a day, it kept climbing for months.
I have a very good feeling about this line. I like this stock

HATE THIS SUB NOWADAYS
If you wanna down vote this go ahead.   I just wanted to tell how I feel about WSB. Once upon a time it was a great sub filled with memes fun and people supporting each other. Nowadays it’s just hate everywhere. May be it’s time to move out and find the same old sub. May be they all just left and did not tell us. Before everything that happened in last few days. We used to have so much fun with TSLA NIO PLTR Now it’s just people hating abusing each other and so many bots you can’t even differentiate between real WSB users and bots anymore.   Mods please don’t remove this post.   No matter how this goes down we are still a community that was known for some fun and positivity. The daily threads were so good before all this. Now it’s just hate and everybody trying bring each other down.   I know many of you might feel the same thing.   Just wanted to say thank you very much for the old times. It made me very happy each and every day to be a part of this sub.   Take care boys and girls.
Goodnight sweet prince
No one will see this and I don't care. Just writing for therapy at this point. I've been in WSB since roughly 600k subs. I've watched it grow and it was probably my favorite place on the internet, but the events of last week was the coup de grace for this place. I was complaining about 2M subs and worried about what would happen to the fabric of what we were at that capacity, but at almost 9M subs just a week and a half later, in addition to the TRAGIC loss of our OG crowd and actually good moderators, this place has heard its death rattle.      The real loss here wasn't money. It was the sub itself. Off to find a replacement that will never quite fill in the same space in my heart.  Unsubscribed.
Not the wealthiest retard here, but just bought my first ever stock thanks to y’all! $2k for AMC
Ahh I misread my portfolio. I am in a lost of $74k. Thanks for pointing out to me WSB. I THINK I’ll hold since I’ve only lost my lunch money 💰
WE'RE DOING IT GUYS, JUST HOLD THE LINE
Real talk, which is less ass: Fidelity or Vanguard
In a time of crisis, neither brokerage restricted trading. I also believe neither sell your order flow data to fuck you on the back-end. Thus I’m looking to move into one or the other (get fucked RH)  The problem is, I understand the UI for both is ass. Also I’ve heard each one has specific quirks,   Fidelity has a very restrictive +50% sell limit order cap.  So fellow glue eaters, which one do you prefer and why.
ONE SMALL TIP TO AVOID GETTING MARGIN-CALLED
This is not financial advice.
This is not financial advice.  Well. In my absolutely unique circumstances, for me the perfect time to buy is right now. Your circumstances are different so do not read further.  I’m thinking there are   million     on this sub, we have normal leadership resuming.   There is a fucking flash sale on this stock the likes of which has not been seen in history.  The volume of share ownership due to synthetic shares seems to be significantly larger than the volume of shares that actually exist resulting in crazy pressure that is causing the hedgerows to run media  , collude and generally sell their souls to recover losses knowing the financial outcome is better in the short term.     whilst the manipulation continues, we have a chance right now.  Volume limits don’t exist. Robinhood and everyone else have opened things up.   The power of retail is still really unknown and by the love of tehlu right now all the bloody billboards are advertising GME.  9th Feb   17-19 Feb plus senate hearing.   Free press you say? The story of an underdog being cheated in the media? A movie in the works(despite the cash going to low lives) and STILL Ryan Fucking Cohen at the helm, hiring like a mad thing in the e-commerce sector?  This is not financial advice and I’ve been doing this for half a second, but a story is being told here and personally I’m banking on value in the next few years  🏼‍♂️   Plus, the pride for what we’ve exposed.   TL/DR:
PSA: Create and cancel sell and buy limits to confuse hedge funds and big data
Disclaimer: I’m a programmer analyst with 2 years of experience in the field of web developing and cyber security.   I’ve no fucking clue how the code of these big corpo cunts work. I’m just an ape.    So this has been going on in the sub, Robinhood and other brokers make money selling data of what their users are going to do, before it’s available to the users. Aka, preparing for what the retail investors are going to do after the market opens. But how do they know it? Do they read our smooth brains? Nope, not yet, let me explain.  Basically mind reading isn’t available, yet, so the next best thing is big data. My guess is each time you create sell limits, stop losses, buy orders etc that are not done while the market is open, it sends all the stats to these big players, so their algorithms create what the general consensus is, to prepare their tactics or to fuck over the little guys, like us ape brothers.  In the privacy world some people, like me, love protecting ourselves making that big data useless. But how do you make it useless? Spam the premarket, market or after hours with limits and buy orders that you can cancel (please check this before), so basically you are creating random untrue data that it’s not really what you’re going to do kind of data. So they have false information for their predictions.  For example: Wanna buy? Set to sell 2 shares at 600$ with limit orders, but when the market opens cancel that bitch and buy GME like a true ape.  TLDR: If you wanna confuse big data algorithms create orders for things you don’t intend to do and then cancel them.    Please be careful. I like the stock but I love you guys more. GME to the fucking next galaxy!           Thank you for coming to my TED talk.  Edit: A user messaged me to warn everyone to check their stop losses. The stock is super volatile so it’s going to trigger (and has already) lots of them. If you believe in the company, why even use one? - (credit for the user is pending, he may not want to be mentioned)
If these hedge funds are smart, they are scrambling to cover now before other hedge funds do.
You can make the case that GME’s valuation at $40-$50 is justifiable by its current cash flow assumptions. So buying at these levels really isn’t that retarded. After all, GME was trading around $20-$30 on organic demand before the squeeze.
ALPP?
Eyeing ALPP. They do autonomous drones which is all the rage rn. Cheap as fuck right now ($  too with   average 7 day volume. May buy 1000 shares during a dip. YOLO???     $ALPP go BRRR    Not financial advice  Edit: Market cap is only 817M, but it will break 1B any day. Look at the fucking charts. Let me know if this isn’t allowed  Edit2: I like the stock and want to see if anyone else likes it too and why
Hold my peepee Wall Street. It’s too hard I can’t take it anymore. I can’t count, I am colorblind too. I Think I am Up $83k?
A look into Astroturfing and Bot   on Reddit
I was skeptical that there were actual bots promoting disinformation   on Reddit and elsewhere, until one actually replied to a random comment I made on r/NFL. It commented over 300 times in a matter of days spamming the same messages.   After that I did some digging and have found the same bot using the same quotes on  . The objectives of this one   seem to be:  - Using buzzwords to try to tie (digital currency) to the Superbowl and Elon Musk    - Massive push on Silver on multiple platforms    - Multiple sponsored articles on sites such as Yahoo saying the "Reddit Mob" is now moving into Silver, Nokia, (digital currency) etc    - Implying there is organization and insider trading going on in Reddit    To be clear, I don't actually think most of these are 'bots' per se, as that's overly complex and easy to catch by Reddit servers. I think this is a coordinated     by people who are getting paid to post propaganda.  There are some clues in this   as to who it was paid for by, as it comments on random articles related to Citadel and their ties to the SEC. All of this is current and ongoing as of the morning of 2/5.  What other evidence have you guys found of this type of Astroturfing? What are their objectives? Can we post evidence?     Edit Removed references to specific digital currencies to appease Automod
My uncle has been feeling down with $GME but he just shared this with me and I haven't seen him this happy
He was getting a lot of flack for putting so much of his life savings into $GME that he shut himself off from the rest of the family but just today he came up to me pounded his chest and said "Ape strong together" I was a little confused until he showed me why he was smiling so much. He made a website and clothing and everything and I thought you guys would really like it. He said he was kind of embarrassed about it but I think it's really nice. So here it is the website is   and hes promised to donate 15% and match it to the Center for Great Apes which I thought was really cool. There's also a discount code "BUYTHEDIP" for 92% off which I thought was crazy until I saw what he priced the clothing at. Keep    and I hope to see you guys on the moon with my couple shares!
I am honestly kind of disappointed in this sub.
Hey fellow retards, I just wanted to come on here and say that you have kind of let me down a bit.  For months I have been observing the daily autism rituals with giddy mouth breathing.  I followed and jumped in on this GME play with a passion as the community was absolutely fired   was all before the 💩 storm that followed.  The energy was full on big D plays, everyone was on board the  .     We squeezed em, we hit them where it hurt because we caught them with their pants down.  However, when they started to squeeze   most apes knew they would, it is as if most tucked tail and ran.  I didn't know apes had tails?     The fact is, we knew they would hit back, and hard.  But nothing has changed, their short interest has INCREASED not gone down.  If anything they are more exposed than when we started and now the price is low.  Instead of seeing hordes of Buy the Dips and such, I am seeing negative sentiment paper hand cry baby BS.  Yes, we are   more dang shares and squeeze the scum again.  The only way we actually lose is if yall give up.  I like this stock and they are now laughing at us.  Let's show them we still got some fight left.  Not investment or financial advice.  I am not a financial advisor.  These are the ramblings of an idiot.  I might be legally handicapped, results still out.  TLDR: they are exposed now more than ever, yet this time shares are on sale.  If you were in at   should be able to buy at  's not go down as a laughing stock    💪             25 @ 32 15 @   holding  Squeeze em again retards
Netflix is trading at $552 per share
Netflix is trading at $552 per share.  Imagine Gamestop has their own set top box CONSOLE and controllers where you can stream 1000s of games for a monthly subscription as well as mobile version and it's all integrated for massive multiplayer online.  Then they could start their own studio like netflix does with movies. With their strategic alliance with Microsoft, hmmm!?  Then they wouldn't need to be symbiotic with all the other platforms. They could make revenue with their own hardware.. it could also have netflix app.. netflix+gamestop.  So with Microsoft alliance they collab on the Xbox games.  With their in-store pc building the get into pc niche.  With esports they'd be locked..  what does that leave for playstation?  Scraps.  Steam?  IDK  I like the stock!!!!!

Surging, says Joe Kernen. The ability to buy was taken away and the price dropped. Hold on, think about that Joe, the number of buyers was artificially curtailed and price dropped. Think about it, Joe. Supply and demand are still fundamental. Take away demand and what happens to price?
The crew on Squawk Box somehow do not recognize that demand was ARTIFICIALLY deflated by Robinhood.  For price, DEMAND matters.  Take away demand (take away the buyers) and price drops.  Why don't they report on that? Or, report on who was talking into Larry Fink's ear during Sorkin's interview.  He was sputtering out lines that were coming through his ear and nobody said anything.  Credibility would have DEMANDED questioning who was feeding the lines.  Supply and demand are fundamental to price, but that hasn't been any part of the story.

What are the chances of a lawsuit against the Citadel?
So under RH's agreement any member, as a client, essentially can't join a class action lawsuit. What about the GME holders who lost over 300% of their investment due to their manipulation?

I don't have    and I'm not afraid to say it.
I'm not holding because I have   .  I'm holding because I'm a vindictive bitch.  If there is even a   chance that my holding a handful of shares of GME can hurt a hedge fund, I'm taking that chance.  IDGAF about the money. I dropped what I could, though admittedly it wasn't much, but I will hold these shares until fucking doomsday.  And I'll do it again. And again. And again.  Anytime I see an opportunity to hurt short sellers and hedge funds, I'll take it. Fuck them. Fuck all of them.  I've lost more than this in a casino. Hell I've burned more than this on a hand of blackjack, bluffing with 9 high, and random spots on a roulette wheel.  I've dropped $50k on craps in a single day.  You think I care about a stock dropping? I don't even like GameStop! Hell if I sold now the loss would be less than what GameStop would typically force trading in a game or console!  If the stock goes to $0 and GameStop goes tits up, fuck it it's only money, and it was a helluva ride while it lasted. If it goes to the moon, cool I'll buy more stupid shit I don't need or blow it on some tech (assuming it's ever in stock) while bathing in the tears of former billionaires.  I don't have   . I have something much more dangerous.  A stunning lack of fucks to give, and an excess of spite.  I'll see you kids on skid row as we compete and fight over a street corner, or on the moon fighting over street corners. I don't care which.

If Robinhood IPOs, do not short them, completely ignore them.
I've seen a lot of people discussing shorting Robinhood, if they IPO. But don't. Hedge Funds are going to be pissed that we have cost them billions of dollars with GME and AMC, likely to be more in the coming days. If Robinhood IPOs, and we short them, the Hedge Funds will do to us exactly what we've done to them.        Being on the wrong end of shorts has a much larger loss potential than just buying a stock. It's why the Hedge Funds frantically spent so much money to try bringing the stock prices down again.         TL;DR: If you try to short Robinhood, the Hedge Funds will have an opportunity to screw you very hard.        This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor by any means
How do you keep positive?
So I planned to buy 10 shares at 100 but only bought 5. After seeing what happened I'm glad I only bought 5.  I will hold since it's not that of a great loss but still this feels bad.   How do you stay positive when seeing the loss? And what makes you to keep holding on to the stock?

GME paper hands are out its time for diamond hands to step up
Listen, the GME game is still in play.  Paper hands sold out, drove the price down, robinhood lifted limits, pre-market is insane, a lot of us our doubling down.  I have a market order to double my position and significantly lower my cost basis.  This is a chance for those that are not afraid to double down and actually show everyone what some real diamond hands look like.     I don't think anyone thats looked over the numbers thinks for a second that shorts have been covered.  The volume doesn't exist.     Not financial advise and I may or may not be a retard investor.
The price has dropped, but nothing has changed. They still need our shares
The only thing different about today and last Wednesday is that we can load up our shares even cheaper. Last week all of us retards were happy to buy shares at $300+ because the hedge funds needed to cover their shorts. Well guess what my fellow smooth brained apes, they still need to cover them! If you were fucking retarded enough to buy at 300, why would you not buy at $60?? The situation is still the same. If we buy and hold, the price goes up. All those smug paper hand pricks have sold their 2 shares to get back $120 from the $700 they spent because their wives boyfriends threatened to beat them up. But guess what retards, YOUR WIFE'S BOYFRIEND ISN'T GOING TO FUCK WITH AN APE WITH DIAMOND HANDS! If you can afford it, keep buying, if you can't, clench those fucking hands until that $60 piece of coal turns into a $500 diamond again. I DIDN'T HEAR NO GOD DAMN FUCKING BELL
How to be less retarded
So I'm very new to this. Obviously yolo'ing on gme is fun but does anyone have advice for trying to do this stock thing semi-properly.  I know about not putting everything into one stock but that's about it. Any websites or literature that covers the basics?
what if it really WAS all over?
what if fairies couldn't fly?  and what if the rainbow above me, didn't just float in the sky?  what if when clouds turned to raindrops,  the rain didn't fall down below?  and the trees and the grass were all stopping,  and never just finished their growth.  and what if the stocks were all fixed?  and the whole game was just all rigged?  the whole systems turned against you,  the cards stacked and there's no way to win.  and what if the sun didn't shine right?  and the taste of food melted away?  what if you folded and walked out?  when all you needed to do was hold and pray?      \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  not financial advice not financial advisor
This is When I Believe the Shorts Will Start Covering - A Deep Dive
Hi everyone!  Apologies if this is the 2nd time you've read this. My first post was mysteriously   money getting the real info removed?  After having meticulously researched  this sub as to when the shorts expire I have discovered that all of you mostly think it's Friday, so I have a strong feeling it will definitely be Friday like you all said and I trust you. (Putting 74k on GME today)  However, I do feel there's a caveat as I've read it might be next week too so...  If it's not Friday it'll definitely be next Monday or   Wednesday...Thursday? Maybe Friday after next then? If not by then it will definitely be within the week after that, or the month after. Or at the very least within 6 months possibly 12 but could be 10 years...definitely within 25 years though. Conservatively you could stretch that to 50 as a safe bet but to err on the safe side of caution I'll say, by this time in the year 2146, they'll have started covering.   I'm certain of it.  HOLLLLLLLLD!          🌕
ROBINHOOD KILLED MY WIFE'S BOYFRIEND
Srsly, are you retards buying through Robinhood after the way they failed you?

Who remembers the end of Infinity War? Well, this is it.
Who remembers the first time they watched Avengers: Infinity War?   Who remembers the ending? The despair.    Everyone had come together, fought their hardest fight, with all their emotion and might. Yet still they lost. Thanos had won, and we witnessed half of the world diminish into a fine dust in the blink of an eye. All hope had been lost and it hit the world hard. It hit deep, it hurts us still. Maybe we are just a bunch of weebs after all, with nothing to our name.   Well, FUCK THAT.   This was only the first fight ladies and gentlemen. Autists and retards - you must understand.    We took a big loss and beating this week and it has - like the film - seen half of us vanish into the void as if we never believed in the cause.   And yet, I sit here now - typing with a smile on my face - with hope.   Because I know that on this day we still stand strong. Sure there may only be half of us left - but we now have our resolve. We are calm, we have clarity. We now know what we're up against.   It's time to get back on the horse.   Dr Strange is DeepFuckingValue - he may have foresaw this - but he couldn't tell us all.   1 in 14,000,000 chance we win this - but we're autistic, so it might as well be 1 in 1 because we can't do math.   We might lose him too - like the Avengers lost Dr Strange. But in his memory is where we prevail and march forward unto victory. And in memory of the half we have lost - we march forward for them.   Our lowest point is our defining moment and we now realize that now. The strength that comes from our realization is unmatched and will be fiercer and bloodier than anything the world has seen before. Because when 8 million autists come together and march as one - who wouldn't run from that?   I come to you now - at the turn of the tide - to remind you all that today is where we pick ourselves up with a new identity.  We will not go quietly into the night.   We will not vanish, without a fight. We're going to live on, we're going to survive.   Today - we celebrate our autism day.
Netflix is trading at $519 a share!! Netflix+Gamestop
Netflix is trading at $552 per share.  Imagine Gamestop has their own set top box CONSOLE and controllers where you can stream 1000s of games for a monthly subscription as well as mobile version and it's all integrated for massive multiplayer online.  Then they could start their own studio like netflix does with movies. With their strategic alliance with Microsoft, hmmm!?  Then they wouldn't need to be symbiotic with all the other platforms. They could make revenue with their own hardware.. it could also have netflix app.. netflix+gamestop.  So with Microsoft alliance they collab on the Xbox games.  With their in-store pc building the get into pc niche.  With esports they'd be locked..  what does that leave for playstation?  Scraps.  Steam?  IDK  I like the stock!!!!!

$GME - this is a full blown war right now. It' go time. It's do or die.
Title really says it all. Although there is a chance the price will rise over time if people keep holding, it seems a lot more risky to the cause. People will get bored. People will sell their losses if the price is stable on a low level. There will be more and more paper hands with time, interest in WSB and $GME is gonna fall - but that only is if we only hold and if Melvin keeps playing for time. That's what they're hoping for, and we must not let that happen.     Now is the time to strike back. If people with buying power who like the stock buy more and more, we can put unparalleled pressure on Melvin and the shorts once again, the price will rocket a lot sooner. People are gonna get more interested again, maybe some new ones get attracted, who will in turn further increase the pressure by buying.  Cuban has talked about this. Brokerages have rescinded the restrictions. Today and the days after the weekend will probably show where this is going.  It's go time, fellow investors who happen to like the stock for some reason - to Valhalla!  Show them what you're made of, show them that you will not yield.  (not financial advice)

How to get into stocks and trades?
(More specifically, what to do and the do's and don'ts)  I guess you can call me a bandwagon but the recent WSB Gamestop thing increased my interest more in investing, and im at the age where curiosity lingers in every corner so here.  I know the basics of stock trading? From what i know: (please correct me if im wrong)   It's basically putting your money into a company or product or shares if that's the correct term then you hope it would go up to make some profit.  But what I really wanna know is when and what should I look out for when doing this.

Let's have rational approach on GME
First, i'm still in 455 shares. Sold some calls during pumps so I already locked in $25k in gains.  So, let's address this. The "Squeeze" we've been having IMO is not a short squeeze but a mix of a FOMO rally and  some  shorts covering and shorts opened at the top. We can't deny that. It's not comparable to the dot com bubble because many of those companies really didn't have any value and was purely on speculation. GME's point is to rally so hard to margin call the shorts but RH capped us and screwed us over. Is there still hope? Who knows.  Next, GME has to be a profitable company or show good signs of a turnaround for shorts to realize they've had enough gains/losses and should start exiting in an attempt maybe to short at higher PT. Read the actual DD—it has always been a value play.  From Chewy wiki:   Chewy was founded under the name "Mr. Chewy" in June 2011 by    . In March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million, despite losing money in its first half   2014 to 2015, sales grew from $205 million to $423 million.   It's not exactly bananas to bananas but you see a pattern here? Ryan hiring people with experience then building with his team to make a company better? The reason GameStop has been on a decline has   always   been because of bad decisions at the executive levels. If you've ever had the pleasure of working under people with actually good management skills, you'd know they'd mostly succeed wherever they go. You can move, change your job, or enter a different circle of people but you'll   always   bring yourself. A person who can successfully turn around a company after getting rid of the old problems? Bullish.  I'm not telling you to buy or sell, i'm not a financial adviser but jezuz, ya'll acting like everything about this company depends in 24 hours or a week. It will depend on   GameStop   to drive another rally whether with a squeeze or not. Give more attention to the earnings and GameStop's road map rather than SI %. If not a short squeeze play, consider it a boring long investment, your 401ks probably have gone up and down throughout the years but you didn't shit yourself each time right? Relax and let go of the price action.  You will be tempted to sell at lows, you will be tempted to sell highs just to "break even". It's your choice whether you can stomach loss, potential gains, or opportunity costs harder, but please, consider the actual company instead of just the price. I got in because I believed the price was just bad sentiment and artificially driven down by over shorting.  Lastly, unless you're not meeting bills, financial obligations, or paying your monthly dues for the backdoor brojob Wendy's, relax. Nothing has changed, the outside world hasn't changed, the ground that you're stepping on hasn't changed, only your perception has changed. Stop day dreaming about massive gains or dreading about massive losses. Have a more stoic approach and a plan.  That being said, I'm glad to have held and cried with you all. Even if it was for just a moment I actually saw a solidarity that didn't care about politics, race, or gender—only tendies and each other. You lose, you gain, that's life but life is not only about gains and losses.  TL;DR: Look at other things aside from price action. It's been quite a ride, it's an honor to have been in it. Don't worry so much, your wife's BF will take care of her while you do other things. I'm riding this ship til GameStop develops a cure for cancer.  455 shares @

GME is done - get out while you can
Y’all smoking some serious copium. The GME train is done unless you’re in it for the long haul.  how about those diamond hands
Newbie from India. Help me get in and hold.
Posting from work on behalf of 12 of us here who all want to get in on the action from India.  We are complete idiots wrt to this and do not know how to proceed.  I'm also unsure what the best brokerage (app) is to proceed with, I know RH doesn't let non-americans sign up.  I read somewhere about another Asian who funded his       account and lost everything because he was actually trading umm.. CFDs and didn't change the.. leverage settings or something. If this is the case indeed then aren't these brokerages actually making money hand over fist due noobs wanting to get in the GME frenzy?  I feel if there was proper guidance on how international noobs can get started and setup their apps or whatever to hold long then WSB can actually have more people backing them. I for one will make a wiki-style post if I figure how its done.  My main questions are  1. What brokerages are good for Non-Americans? 2. Should we go with CFDs or Options? 3. Can a non-American actually legally even own a stock of an American company listed on NYSE? 4. Is there a basic guidance on account setup so as to not let brokerages dupe us into losing our money?  I'm sorry if asking all this is against the rules, I've searched all morning on reddit and YouTube but I found nothing that clearly explains. Any help will be much appreciated.  I also feel that this battle of GME Vs. Hedge Funds may go on for a little longer than people think and with each passing day many many international folks are going to want to join in with WSB. So, I'm still going to continue searching for info and even if this thread dies cold, I'll come back and make a guide.
Seven things everyone needs to hear
1. I love you. 2. I'm proud of you. 3. I am sorry. 4. I forgive you. 5. I listen to you. 6. Hold $GME. 7. You can do it.

Does WSB have it in them?
With restrictions being lifted all over the place, do you feel WSB’s, and the fellow monkey brained allies of WSB, push on GME will continue? Do you think we all have it in us to make our loss porn that much more sexy? Or is the media correct in saying that the party’s over?
It May Be OK If You Bought GME Too High
Disclosure: 8 shares @    While I am a new investor (less than a year), I feel it is important to inform those of you who may not know that the average cost of your shares   your share count is exactly how much you have spent on the stock.  So, if you ended up buying too high, you can buy more at lower and lower prices to drive that average cost down. This is important because it allows you to not lose as much money. It sounds weird but it's true and moves from a YOLO play to a long term hold.  We have to remember that the current real value of GameStop is $33 according to macroaxis. If the shorts continue to bully us down, we'll see prices below that before too long and you can buy the dip.  Consider my position. If the stock falls to $15 for example, then I can buy 100 shares to get an average cost of (8     + 100     / 108 = $  which is below it's real value and so in time I will have recovered my losses.  So, the very worst thing to do is panic sell at a loss. Time has an opportunity to recoup your losses but selling off removes that possibility.  Do you believe GameStop will survive? Maybe even thrive under new business decisions? Then consider averaging down instead of exiting.  I do understand that my position is not that high compared to what some of you others are doing and maybe averaging down is not financially possible at this point, but for those of you who can - don't lose hope so quickly.   And hey, we might see another epic squeeze soon. History repeats itself and if the bad guys aren't caught, do you think they learned anything?   But again, I'm a pretty new investor so I welcome all counter arguments and discussion on the subject. I'm trying to learn everything I can to be successful at this.

Does anyone know when   data is updated? Sorry, I’m retarded and lack basic knowledge about any of this crap. Asking to gain a brain cell.
The "WHO IS STILL HOLDING" posts should get removed and you people know it

NOKIA 3310 FOUND IN DRAWER AFTER 20 YEARS STILL HAS 70% BATTERY!!! Sell AAPL, buy NOK!
Kevin Moody , a roofer from   Ellesmere Port  , has recently cleared out his ‘man draw’ looking for a key to the shed when he stumbled upon his old  Nokia 3310  mobile phone. The phone was still switched on, and had been forgotten about for 20 years.  Incredibly the phone still had just over 70% battery remaining. Kevin remarked how he didn’t ever remember charging the mobile, or even owning a charger.  Today’s mobile phones, such as iPhones, have an average battery life of around 17 minutes and require plugging in throughout the day in order to have enough power for the bus or train ride home. The Nokia 3310, however, never required charging. Ever.  Scientists believe that Nokia, rather than make a mobile phone, had instead created renewable energy.  Doctor  Ivor Bignob , currently teaching at Cheshire College, commented:  > THE NOKIA 3310 BATTERY IS LIKE PERPETUAL MOTION. IT SHOULDN’T EXIST, BUT IT DOES. ONE NOKIA 3310 CAN POWER A CITY FOR ALL TIME.   Conspiracy theorists believe the Nokia 3310 disappeared because of threats and underhand tactics from fossil fuels, as a battery that never ran out would cripple the fossil fuel industry.  Mr Moody’s phone is currently serving him well as both a texting device and a spare hammer for when he drops his at work.     UPDATE: Can all the fucktards that keep deleting their comments just leave them on, they are fucking hilarious! Everyone will be laughing with you, not at you.  UPDATE 2: What is the world coming to that so many people think this is for real?!?!

if people want to still believe and hold their shares then thats their business, at the end of the day, playing the stock market is always a gamble, nothing is guaranteed. if you bailed out then thats on you, stop moaning at others
i am still holding because i gambled what i could afford to lose, if it pays off then its all good i will be very happy, if i lose then thats my money to lose.

The Psychology of Diamond fkn Hands
All our lives, through school, college, social media and more we are expected to take an action. Pick an answer, post a picture,    When in your life has chilling and staying put been the thing society wanted. We are trained to move. Make decisions. Never stay still  So when the stress kicks in, you feel you have to pick a lever and pull it. Thats how we have been conditioned. Our knee jerk reaction is to make a decision under pressure.   Being patient is a huge life skill, across all aspects of life and I don't think we get taught it very well. Making a call and sticking with it, waiting and being patient under high pressure will test you, and you will build that skill.

If 1,000,000 of us bought a shirt from GAMESTOP, this would happen!!!
First of all, GAMESTOP needs to produce merch. I read a post on here that said someone wanted to buy a shirt from the store and they had nothing. It's time for us to change this.  At $25 a shirt, which will cost around $5-6 to produce and fulfill, the company will net close to $20,000,000. And in their last quarterly report GME reported a net income of -$18,800,000, so if you add $20,000,000 doesn't that give you +$1,200,000?   All it takes is 1 shirt, and of course you see where I'm going with this. What stops GME from becoming the largest merch company for gaming apparel?  We can all make this a reality by emailing George Sherman this post:         Gap is an 8Bn dollar company. Trust me, I can build this apparel division out to eclipse Gap so we all get quality products with some kick ass designs.   What has unfolded these past few weeks will be enshrined in history. Some made money, some lost. But the fact is the brand equity is stronger than ever, probably the strongest brand on Earth right now, so if we all mobilize our energy and email George Sherman to make this happen we'll be on our way to increasing the share price.  Let's go!

The GME thread at this point is almost like a FOMO sales thread, where people who sold are asking other people to sell just because they don't want to be the only people who missed out if the squeeze happened.  Can we have a positive and negative thread. Where the retards can continue being retarded together and the sellers can go and justify their own losses together?
Current state of GME
Here read it there, since mods won’t allow me to post my DD here:     Please stop going full retard!
Hodling. We will rise.
$GME up 13% from yesterday in Europe!
YIKES
Why the squeeze might happen before 2/9
February 9th is the day the short interest report will come out for GME. Many have speculated that these numbers could perhaps be altered to mislead the public, but it was pointed out by another user that the brokerages are the ones that report the short interest. (Just a reminder there are brokers like Fidelity who have long positions in GME) Over the whole week ladder attacks have taken place to drive the stock price   it be the hedge funds setting themselves up to cover for cheaper? There is almost no way mathematically that hedge funds have covered and short interest report on 2/9 could be the final catalyst to trigger the squeeze. However with GME at the low price it is now, it is possible the hedge funds planned for this and bought way OTM calls as a hedge for squeeze. (that way they profit too)  Again I could be completely wrong, and if this doesn’t happen that doesn’t change the fact that the shorts have not covered and will still be in danger even after 2/9. (This is not financial advice)
Robinhood falsifying market data
See    Overlay pictures of candel stick graphs:     The data transformations in the page source of the RH advance chart of GME:     Tl;dr: RH is getting so desperate as to lying to us to our face now.  Discuss here.
I accidentally revealed to people that i bought 15 GME @ 310 so can you tards hurry up and pick me up so i dont look like an actual retard
Do your thing fellow diamond handed apes
They’re literally PAYING us to stay    $RBNH to the dirt!!
SURPRISE SNEAK ATTACK
LETS TRIGGER THOSE $800 EOW CALLS. PRICE SO LOW. BUY UP SO MUCH. THEIR DEFENSES ARE DOWN. GOGOGOGOGOGOGO.             THIS WAY THIS IS THE WAY
Why I'm not selling GME until its hits $10
I'm down 80%. I entered in during the big swings at around 300.  GME is a $10 stock. Entering at $300 I knew my risk was $290 for the potential gain of thousands.  There is no free lunch here. I was and am still willing to pay that risk.  Selling now, after close to 80% of my risk has already evaporated and paid down makes no sense for me.  I still have close to 100% of my potential upside but almost 90% of my downside risk has already been realized.  Selling now is wasting that 90% already spent. When it goes up from here, I will have nobody to blame other than my very own paper hands.
Let’s fucking go motherfuckers. Green dildos for everyone that doubted. Bears r fuk.
Fight back with everything you've got!
We have been getting knocked down, but getting right back up all week! Now is the time we have them on the ropes! Push them back and hold the line! We may actually gain traction again today! Dont be discouraged if you see dips! We are all here today HOLDING the line! End the week strong so we can end next week even stronger!
Why are people surprised that the stock dipped when the entire WSB said it would?
I want to start this by saying that I do not have any money in the stock (unfortunately I am currently living check to check so I didn't have disposable income to risk investing). My main question is why are people surprised the GME stock dipped when literally everyone said it would dip before the big squeeze?   Basically in every post the comments explained that the stock would dip for a number of reasons, including RH restrictions and hedge funds pulling sneaky shit to artificially lower the prices. It seemed so obvious that this was going to happen and the plan was to HOLD no matter what (for those who like the stock). It really frustrated me to see everyone panic selling their stock to reduce their loss and actually lower the stock price.   I am still a believer that the squeeze has yet to come and the hedge funds will get screwed in the end. I am really hoping y'all can pull this off and make some money while you're at it. Honestly it is inspiring that a group of "unsophisticated retail investors" are taking on these greedy giants.   GME to the moon!!!        Edit: If it wasn't clear by what I said in the post, I have little to no knowledge on the stock market or investing. I'm just a spectator who wants to see rich people lose a lot of money.
Everyone who is still  🤲 has been promoted to  🍆
Buy more if you can - Hold - Stay hydrated. Dont obsess over it too much and just stay calm. Take care y'all !
GME holders, you are an owner of a portion to GameStop. What are you going to do?
Redditors,    You hold ownership to a portion of GameStop. The company is obligated to take seriously what stockholders say in where the company is to go.   Well you gave them your money! Now as a community what are the changes you want from gamestop? What do you think they can do to improve? Do you want them to develop something? Partner with steam or make their own DRM?   What direction do we want this last of the brick and mortar game stores to go? Do we want them to be the next blockbuster or Sears? Or do we want them to be the Costco or Google of games?   Anyway, I see how everyone loves the stock as much as I do. We want to save this company right?   To Gamestop,   I love you, stop trying to upsell shit to me. I already know the game I want. It's why I entered your store. I'm already loyal buying there. Don't push me away with the extra ping pong paddle that works with Mario tennis. I don't reeeeally need it and probably shouldn't spend my money on it.    Anyway. Here is more info on ownership.
DO NOT BELIEVE THOSE PESSIMIST POSTS!!!
Listen here you lil' retards!  All those pessimist posts about how GME is dead etc. This is not true. That can be one of those we are fighting against posting shit to get us out of hope! We have to keep doing what we're doing and i think it's beautiful!! Love you my fellow apes!!!
Not much but for a student who started with 500 it ain’t bad. Still holding!
I hope I’m not breaking any of the sub’s rules by posting this, but I am SOOOO HAPPY that this sub is back.
I’m new to trading, new to stocks, but I realized that I had an opportunity to get myself out of a financial hole in cold and uncertain times without the ability of working a regular job. So I found this sub, and I instantly was thankful to be around like minded individuals where I can learn more about stocks and study people’s DD somewhere outside of just YouTube.    Seeing the sub go downhill and making a complete 180° turn from optimism into chaos and corruption injected a lot of anger and stress into me and a lot of others in the hopes of panic selling. If Robinhood never restricted GME and AMC, those stocks would’ve never bombed, but even with those restrictions everyone was still wearing their losses as a badge of honor and buying billboards, supporting these stocks unconditionally.    February 3rd comes along and there’s dozens if not hundreds of bots spreading fear and negativity and encouraging traders to panic sell. The most trusted and most active mods get booted, auto mod gets removed and the whole thing turns into a shit show (and not in a good poop flinging at each other way). The worst part to me is that I know some people actually got convinced into panic selling at a big loss, and I can’t imagine how devastating that must be some people during a pandemic. Knowing how things were going the day before, people would’ve have been as terrified as they were before the turmoil the bots and MSM caused within this sub. We were motivating each other. We were all memes and emojis and happy to share our loss porn, the community bond was some real shit. Motherfuckers tried to ruin that and scare newcomers into not buying even at such a discount, and scaring others to sell at catastrophic losses (sus as fuck).   Seeing sellouts being called out and seeing loss porn and camaraderie again in this sub fills me with joy. Sure there are still bots and hacked accounts trying to convince others that $GME is dead or whatever, but almost everyone now knows FOR SURE that it is all fake and an infiltration being used as an intimidation tactic. I’m so happy to be back in WSB again. I’m so happy that people aren’t being shamed and bombarded with negativity for holding anymore. I’m so happy to be a part the OG sub full of retards and autists again. I’m happy that INDIVIDUALS are NOT afraid of HOLDING a stock that they LOVE.   I love yall.       none of this is any financial advice i just like the stock and using emojis
Oh the irony
The auto bot settings are now very different.
EUROPOORS at it again! All restrictions lifted on RH - USApes don't paper hand this
tempted to sell now that it will be up? - this is where you know that they are stuck - 100 is possible today - will you sell????
predicting that HFs are sitting out today and let the market piece this out.    its pysch tactic...  reciprocity so now that they shown how they can get the price down-here is your escape pod.  they even opened up the flood gates a bit, buy all you want... make you believe that you are in this la la awesome land- but it comes with a catch - they made it known they will do everything plus some to drop the price!  they assume we dont know how pricing works... they assume you dont know what volume means... all they want you to believe is that this is your last chance to get out...  so im bag-holding... if i am right then much of what i made on this position will benefit many  im holding.... not fooled by this tactic...  do as you will... my confirmation bias will be affirmed at market open... again math is a friend..... if they are shorting they need it to get to 5 not 30.... furthermore 140% at one point of float.... DAMN   im impressed they could get it to 120% this quick....  and even if it goes red.... if they really covered why is it still still   - 3x 12/31 closing price on borderline pathethic volume for a covered short?????  this is their hail mary pass.... im holding
Please tell me DFV sold at its peak?
Why would they have covered?
If hedgefunds are capable of driving the price heavily down and make it seem as if they have covered, why would they have covered when the price was so high. If they are confident in their ability to tank the share, the only reason for them to cover at high prices would be a margin call. As long as the popular opinion is that the stock will fall further, it is hard to assume that the shorts have covered. They have no reason to cover before the short % report comes, or if people calls the bluff.     My take is that the shorts that managed to stay solvent have not covered, but it is all speculation. We dont really have the information to know whether the squeeze has truly been squoze.
I don’t have much to play with, but I’m with you fellow retards to the moon
Im new to investing, is it worth it to buy GME shares anymore after the dip?
What have we learnt from GME
“If you ask for too much at once, you’ll come home with an empty bag”  Now that is over, I’d like you to remind what to do in case this repeats itself.   Yes, it’s over, the short squeeze was from 40 to 500, get over it.    Lesson 1:  Don’t trust other people regarding to investing, do your own DD before going balls in on a stock. Even if they say it can go 500$ more.  Nobody knows that.   Lesson 2: Diversify, don’t put all your eggs in one basket.   Lesson 3: take profits along the way, at least the initial investment. No one has gone broke by taking profits.   Lesson 4: set up an stoploss to the maximum you can afford to lose, I got in at 340, sold half at 400, then sold the other half at 290. This saved me from bankruptcy.  Lesson 5: This ain’t the fucking titanic, if the ship is sinking, you jump out, look at the bigger picture, if it’s starting to float again, go for it, but be ready to jump out again.  Lesson 6: Don’t take out loans or use other peoples money to gamble in the internet.  Lesson 7: there’s a loss flair in this reddit for a reason, enjoy being part of it. Learn from it.  Lesson 8: don’t use $ROPE, start investing in other companies long term. Do hours of DD and you’ll come out as a winner:  Lesson 9: suck a sick.    My gains/losses: started with a 7k loan(lmao), went up to 70k and pulled out at 30k profits, paid the loan, invested the benefits. I’m at 40k now.
Gonna be worth it. Heads up.
I'M HOLDING GME AND AMC UNTIL THEY MAKE A MOVIE AND VIDEO GAME ABOUT US.
I'm also holding these stock tilI I die. I made my tendies and I'm bringing them tomorrow for the dip.
Tired of what has happened here?
Will add periods to bypass automod filter.   If you would like to leave this madness, join the DDtavern. The finest DD will gather here.       no noobs allowed, and will be     Myself and other mods I will be hiring will strictly enforce our sub rules. We will not let it go to ruin like wsb has.  Kek
I just want to throw this out there, I know we’re all a little extra retarded but the culture here is to embrace the loss porn. We get off on it. Anyone bashing someone for investing in a stock, in my   no room to sit at our table here.
hopefully a mod will speak up about this. Because we idolize people like GUH and call them legends. I dunno fuck the noise And put your 401k’s on the line because it’s always been food s  or lambos here.
Evidence pointing to shorts being illegally manipulated with options
Hi guys, I want to spread the message for discussion and this might be the best way to do it  TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered. Full version below.  For the full read please visit:    Feel free to repost the content if you'd like I just want people to see it
Hold the line, y’all. Nice Pre market
Price Target of $115 EOD for $GME
Edit: Dear SEC intern, this is not financial advice   Truly apologize to the people who bought high and took a loss. You may not want to join back in and I understand. For those who are still in the fight, there's plenty to look forward to.   Yes I know many of you hate RH but it's one of the most accessible apps there are and loosening it's restrictions will benefit holders. Also, many of the FOMOs who didn't get in the first rocket will be able to buy in a cheaper ticket to our second rocket, and this time to Mars. Of course, there's still our thesis of massive short covering which will be released soon.   Remember just a couple months ago, DFV was heavily doubted for his thesis.   Stick to your gut and fuck what everyone else says. People criticizing others for holding are living a beta ass life.   If you want to sell, then sell. If you want to buy and hold, then get ready for the tendieman to fuck your wife's boyfriend.
If you like money short GME and don't be proud of your loss.
What's the name of the mascot? Does he have a name?
You can’t sue Robinhood
I know most of you smooth brain apes didn’t bother reading, but they make you agree to their terms before actually using the app.  Shocker, they retain the right to do anything regarding allowing or not allowing the purchase of stocks at any time with no warning.  They also make you give up your right to take them to court or file a class action lawsuit against them.  There’s more to it...  # HOWEVER  That doesn’t mean you can’t do anything!   You can request and arbitration.  This can get you the same results any court could.    In fact, I figure that if a lot of you go through with an arbitration it’d cost Robinhood a lot of money to pay for it, more than the class action would have gotten from them.  They probably figure that not many of you will actually go through with an arbitration
N i c e loss percentage, still holding and there's no point to sell, haven't much so the life goes on if this goes to 0 (price alert set at 1K if this shit pops up somehow)
The Drop in GameStop Short Interest Could be Real — Or Deceptive Market Manipulation (breakdown of how this is possible)
Hey everyone. Happened across this article today and want to know if there is any veracity to it. Thoughts?    &nbsp;       &nbsp;  Here is the real meat of the article:     &nbsp;     "But there is another possibility, which is that the hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate.     &nbsp;     If the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time.     &nbsp;         That is because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.      &nbsp;     In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short — with tens of billions of dollars on the line — could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.     &nbsp;     The trick would be: “Make it look like we’ve covered our shorts when we really haven’t (because we can’t), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.”     &nbsp;     The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market. The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.     &nbsp;     The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.”  ."    &nbsp;      And this part:    &nbsp;  "The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:     &nbsp;     - If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.     &nbsp;     - A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.     &nbsp;     - The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.     &nbsp;     - This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.     &nbsp;     - As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.     &nbsp;     - The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.     &nbsp;     It gets very complicated, very fast."
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Seeing people still on robinhood is so painful
We literally saw how bad they fucked everyone last week. There are plenty of other brokers. Stop using Robinhood if you don’t want shit like that to happen to us again.
$44K to $  gains in $TSLA options
I’ve been investing in Tesla since May 2019 at under $200/share pre-split. A year ago, I got introduced to options and decided to try it out. I got hugely lucky with timing. Here are my option plays that gave me the biggest returns (I had other smaller wins and a few small losses):  Jan 15 171C   $11,400 -&gt; $585,650    Mar 16 $150C   $15,780 -&gt; $297,675    Mar 19 $240   $17,160 -&gt; $774,300      Total $44,340 -&gt; $1,657,625       I exercised these all early.    ;#x200B;   ;format=pjpg ;auto=webp ;s=14d1ce44d0b71546455cc8ba527b0366e4c1df59   UPDATE 1:  FAQs since y’all ask the same god damn questions  - Why exercise instead of sell the contracts and just buy the shares? Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes.  - when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago.  - do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it’s my biggest holding. It’s the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world’s most valuable company before the end of the decade.  - will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn.  - what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options.  - what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I’m buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.   UPDATE 2:  To all the dudes Messaging me: follow me if you want to know my next play. I’m not going to Message it to the 250+ people who messaged me tonight.   To all the ladies sliding into my messages: thanks for the kind notes. I like volunteering with puppies, sunset walks on the beach, and getting cat-fished.
Sell out or not? Remember what is real!
This isn't financial advice. I'm way below dumb ape understanding. If you read to the second paragraph, then please read to the end.  If you don't spend more than you are willing to lose, then you don't feel the pressure to cut your losses. But maybe you did.  Maybe any potential loss isn't something you need to overly worry about. ask yourself:    How long would it take to earn at my day job the money that I could get from selling out?     Could I earn that even before this all ends?    Will selling out even nearly cover my cost? Enough to make a difference?    How does losing 90% instead of 100% compare with my reason for buying?    If I lose my investment, what practical difference will it make?  If you did spend more than you can afford, then get help, talk to someone you trust. Maybe have a backup person. Start with: "I've been silly". Many people make such mistakes. It doesn't have to define you. Start from where you are now, and remember that most of what you do is OK. It's going to be fine.  Don't do anything rash, don't do anything illegal. If you are in trouble because of hasty action then you do need advice. Don't compound any mistakes you may have made.   I hope no-one has spent the days takings on GME instead of depositing it in the company account, but if you have - it can be put right (it may be hard) but don't make things worse.  Remember that the balls are still in the air, and that there are people who love you more than money, and more than revenge. Maybe you need to go out and find those people - so then do that.  Maybe you need to take a break, even a few hours, to get in touch with things that are or have been more real to you for a while, to find your bearings. Maybe you need to do that every day.  And if it all fades away, maybe in a year or two you could receive delivery of the share certificates and frame them as token gifts, or mementos of today.  With any luck and a favorable wind, these heady days won't be the major days of your life.  And we don't yet know how the balls will land.   Apes stronger together applies all over life, not just for GME. Do good. Be men. Be steady on what is real.   Peace, guys!  [edit -speling mistake]  [edit] If it goes to hell, and you salvage only one thing, let it be a human relationship (a bro, a spouse, a friend, a neighbor), and then you'll be in heaven. (It may take more than one try)
Down %75.. HOLDING!!!  🧨🧨
It’s been a tough week of losses. This HAS gotta be a sign from the gods 🤲🏻 Covid killed my sense of taste so why am I tasting money rn? 🤑📈💵
This won’t work if it’s we’re just holding
You fucking smoothed brained monkeys. Look at the fucking volume we need buys! Holding right now does shit all we need BUYS. Whether you want to admit it or not, the shorts are winning. If you thought people were shorting at $20 what do you think is going on right now!  I deadset can’t be fucked anymore. This sub has gone to shit.
GME Early Morning
Am I the only monke up this late still in search for banana? GME is strangely moving up in the wee hours of the morning. My smooth brain asks why tho?
Wave 2 incoming

+20% in the first 5min of premarket trading HOLD ON we’re going for a roller coaster ride
Do you guys realize that we are still playing the same game, we just died at a checkpoint and have to go back one week. The price is at 50$ again and we have to keep playing.
🤚🏽
My Take on GMESTONK!
Well, after a good shit kicking from the HFs the last few days (and a self induced liver quiver) we find ourselves almost back where we started.   I mentioned a few of these points in the daily once or twice but I think they need to be pointed out again.   Ryan Cohen isn't going to buy another 7% of his stake when the share price is $400. He might however top up with the share price under $50. That is probably the most bullish thesis for a low share price. If he locks up another 7% of the float you would almost have to be more retarded than WSB to hold a short position.  I dont have Twitter but someone mentioned that Cohen also just starting following DFV of Twitter so you know damn well he is keeping a close eye on what's going on.  If I'm Cohen (and the rest of the board tbh) watching what is happening, I've got a shit eating grinn on my face the size of your wifes after her boyfriend is done with her.  Why?  Because us smooth-brained retailers (customers)  just served up an opportunity on a s_lv_r (fill in the vowels, I don't want to hear CNBC shilling the fucking commodity for another week) fucking platter.    Think about this; if the company sticks up for their investors by issuing a call for shares, or reverse split, or some other means to "find the shares", it would a.) Be another good squeeze potential and b.) Solidify their business among retailers (customers) for years to come (sort of like Elon did with Tesla).   Win for investors by straightening out this shorting bullshit, and win for them by gaining life long, loyal customers.   Too many people get caught up in the PRICE of the stock, and not at the MARKET CAP of the company. I would argue right now that with expectations high for the quarter, a new console super cycle, Cohen and his posse on the board, the new   (ex AWS engineer), and pending transition into digital, that the stock is definitely UNDERVALUED at a current Market Cap of   Check out   for more info!  TL/DR: Buy GME at these levels.  Edit: Position: 670 @ $  Rode her up, she rode me down and I plan on riding her up once again!
Am I the only one?
Who else agrees that $GME has no hope, and you’re better off throwing your money in the trash if you buy right now... I know I ain’t the only one
OK, WHO'S STILL HOLDING ?!?!
Ape from Balkan holding strong. No give banana        Waiting banana to ripe🩸🦧
Why didn’t GameStop issue more shares?
Just bought 17 at $55 from Australia
Has this train stopped or is it all retards aboard? I'm an apprentice plumber with 2k to my name. Does this count as a yolo? I've been waiting for my US trading account to open for a piece of this hedge fund pie. Staying up to 3am to see where it goes, fresh ape fodder. LETTTSS GOOOO     btw even if I do lose p much all my savings no matter how small, I'll be ok till next pay check
We might be only one person individually but together we are retarded

What’s the next GME?
I wanna get in early.
If $GME$ hits $200 this week I will buy every single item on r/ActiveDeals & donate it to my local hospital.
I know it's coming, it's tough but it's going to be a rocket week. As soon as the HF have to pay their shorts we are up! I've invested over $20,000 CDN at around $40, so when $200 hits again I'm going on a charity spree getting everything on /r/ActiveDeals. I've been down almost my whole life so it's nice to have a win finally, and be able to share it with others in need.
A cheeper price is good for everyone before we   .
Now, I enjoy crayons on toast as much as the next ape but even I can see that a short term dip in price is a good thing. Not only does it show that the big wigs on wall Street are actively still trying to drive the price down. But the more important thing that it allows, is more potential entry into the market.   A lower price makes the stonk more accessible to your average ape. Meaning more apes can buy it and hold together. The more we buy, the more say we have over what goes on.   Buy and hold.  Now is not the time to be weak.  Apes together strong.                 I eat crayons and if I was you, would not trust me to pet your cat, never mind advise on financial issues.
BUY AND HOLD AUTISTS!
ROBINHOOD AND EVERYONE ELSE REMOVED THEIR LIMITS. LETS NOW BUY ALL OF GAMESTOP AND MAKE THE SHORT SQUEEZE HAPPEN   My Position: 100 AMC, 50 BB, 150 NOK, 20GME  Also: New Buyers basically have a free discount now.
There seems to be a lot of posts talking about how it’s all turning around!!!
For my own personal sake I hope your right, I’m currently 40@$258 so deeeeepppp in the hole... One thing I’ve noticed however is that almost no one disagrees with the current still high risk play.....  Not only do we have unknown numbers ie, shorts but we also have an increasing number of people basically saying the same thing over and over and fkin over again.  What’s the down side.... what are we missing!!! I don’t intend on being a HF bitch again if I can help it...  Serious Bear DD needed....
Anyone have any solid DD on some plays that aren’t GME, AMC, NOK, or BB?
No disrespect to the fellow autists with 🤚  but I’m looking for something else to YOLO
GME Question (serious)
Let’s say HF A shorted 10M GME shares and HF B shorted 10M GME shares. Can they cover their shorts in this manner:  1. HF A buys 500K shares in the open market to cover its short   2. HF B buys 500K shares in the open market to cover its sort  3. HF A and HF B continuously sell the shares to each other to cover their shorts?   If the above theory is not true, then how can the HFs short more 100% of the available stock?
Went from $12,000-$84,000 riding $GME $39-$~250. Went ALL-IN on ARKK and kept buying more shares because I never received an error message. Now holding $348,000 in ARKK
We're going to the moon in 2021

Should I sell all my AMC stock so I have more money to buy the dip?
Seems like the smart play.
The stock is worth what you sell it for.
I don't know how many paper boys need to hear this but it's the truth. This is what people mean by "Just hold" "They need to buy our shares" they're artificially driving the prices down to get you paper cunts to panic and sell. Just don't. It doesn't matter. They can't buy what isn't sold, I can't believe after all this hype you dickheads still don't know what were doing here.  Tldr: I just bought 21 more shares on discount, thanks Melvin
What is the general plan for GME. Is the wall street playing us ?
I would like understand when to sell. I don’t have much money but with the stock up and down I became virtually rich enough to down pay a house to  back to 9-5 job for a long time !!! Feeling stupid !!   How do we know the wallstreet is not playing us..
Won't stop can't stop game stop
Y’all done yet?
Seriously guys. How long are y’all trying to play these dead plays and fill up the entire sub with this crap?   Or is this sub just completely dead now?
I’ve got no choice now, the pressures turned my hands into diamonds
Were the hedge funds the "good guys" when they spent money on ads telling us they got out so we can get out too?
Going all in on GME had me at the edge of my seat yesterday!
Remember HOLD strong and let’s try and keep things Positive today because it is Friday and we here at WSB are proud retards!   Thinking of selling low/in the red?  Cause I'm not! I'm willing to turn GME into a MULTIGENERATIONAL PLAN! (Big Words and shit YOLO)  I'M FUCKING PUMPED FOR TODAY!  Side not: History has been made here guys so don’t forget that.
We won, dont fall into the psychological warefare
Capital Losses are Tax Deductible
Don’t forget - For taxable accounts if you sell at a loss, Capital Losses are Tax deductible and can be carried-over to next year’s tax return if your reach the limit (at least in the US).  Just a reminder - There are no losers, only learners. It’s part of the game. When you play basketball and your shots are being blocked, you learn something and you change your strategy. Same thing.  Others might already be in the moon. Your journey is just delayed. Chin up!
PSA: Transfer your account out of RH to Fidelity or Vanguard. This removes the shares from Citadel's pool so they don't have access to your shares.
Citadel and Robinhood can do a lot more shenanigans when they have control over your shares. Transfer out to Fidelity or Vanguard so they don't have access to your shares.
It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers
Posting again because last one got removed for some bullshit about a ticker name I wasn’t even referring to.   Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen?   It’s simple. Let’s use the worst possible numbers here.   Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x   =   million shares. Let’s say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short.   Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let’s say they covered at 300. You’re telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x   =   billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we’re still talking about   BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would’ve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover.   Hold your fucking shares.  Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.  Edit 2: I know I shouldn’t be surprised you retards don’t understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking   ZERO  . If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95=  -$45  Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I’m getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money.   Please get your head out of your ass.   if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.
First time posting loss porn. It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
I just have a small share in this with $AMC, but I believe in the cause so I ask you please not to give in. Even if your only part in this is just keeping the conversation going. They want to divert the public's attention away from all this, but we won't let them. This is a modern-day rebellion!!!
I just realized WSB probably owns more than half of GME
LETS VOTE IN A NEW BOARD OF TARDS
Integrity of Upcoming Short Interest Reports
The real reason why we should still hold
Fellow retards, take a break from masturbating to current loss-porn and read these (stole from these from an autist).  REMEMBER THE REAL REASON WHY WE ARE DOING THIS, WHY WE ARE STILL HOLDING.                    Remember, gamble only what you can afford to lose and hold it until you see the Valhalla Gates.  Im a broke retard so I only hold 1 share @ $280 and 1 share @ 100  Also this is not a financial advice, Im intellectually incapable of providing one.     See you on the other side! \ diamond emoji\  \ hand emoji\
hold please
please hold
If you need another reason why Robinhood sucks here’s 10.
AMC is up   in Germany in the first hour of trading. RH lifted buying restrictions. Mark Cuban said that when RH lifted restrictions, it’d be the time to show what WSB is made of. Buy AMC and send it to the moon

Avoid the IG trading platform
Just a recommendation for anyone considering IG as a platform for trades to avoid them and use someone else if possible.  Frustratingly they closed a position I had on GME without me requesting the close, when I contacted their help desk the response was to check my password was secure.  I don't think this was someone else closing the position which would make no sense, it happened automatically at market open when I had no stop order in place.  Also IG are one of the platforms continuing to not accept new trades on GME amongst other stocks, all the more reason to use some one else.
Planning for market open
Just saw the restrictions are lifted, amc or gme. I wanna get in before markets open after watching this reddit for a month
GME short squeeze probably won't happen anytime soon
So why do you think RobinHood does not restrict anymore trading GME?  Because short squeeze won't happen any time soon. Old shorts were replaced with new shorts that have been open at $100-$300 level, so they are in deep profit, they are not in a hurry to close their shorts until GME reaches those levels.  I still hold GME because I believe in the turnaround story.   Not financial advice or recommendation to buy or sell. Do your due dilligence. I am a retard who does not know what he is talking about.  Edit 1: just to further clarify, shorts lost billions when they closed their first round of shorts, the trading was restricted for retail traders, new shorts open, and now these new shorts are in profit for an almost equivalent amount of the money they lost, so that hedge funds that were burnt now look good to their investors. It is pure accounting as if they cannot close their shorts, it will never be realized p  ; l, and they cannot close them without retail investors selling.
Got some more going in (don't buully, I'm broke and originally bought in at over $300)
Why people are telling you to sell and move on.
Preface: I’ve been here a relatively long time. I’ve held bags on MSFT 200, tankergang, Spy puts, you fucking name it, I’ve either held the bags myself or jerked off to the lossporn.   In all that time, no single play has dominated the sub for this long. As a matter of fact I’ve never seen one galvanize the sub in such a way. On one hand it’s kinda cool to see such a large group of people go in on something together. On another hand, I’d like to talk about other plays.   I just want to be able to talk about new plays without it being ‘a distraction’ and being downvoted into oblivion.   To be clear, I don’t give two shits if you realize your losses now and stop the hemorrhaging. You’re free to ride this rocket all the way back into the dirt. It’s your cash, not mine.   I’ll call you a dangerous for continuing to ignore the dropping short interest, spreading misinformation about 224% OSI data that’s three weeks old, but it’s your cash.   I’ll call you a smoothbrain for failing to understand that shorts don’t have to buy every single share from every shareholder to cover, but it’s your cash.   I’ll call you a degenerate for fomoing in last week above 300 after musk’s gamestonk tweet, but it’s your cash.   I’ll call you delusional for ignoring that   shares are now available to borrow at the low interest rate of   percent, but it’s your cash.   I’ll call you a the short bus kid for continuing to hemmorage cash because ‘they’re only losses if you sell,’ but it’s your cash.    I’ll call you mentally deficient for making a play that was never going to have a long plateau at the top, but failing to sell at 4000% gains from the March low, but it’s your cash.    I’ll call you full on retarded for saying things like, “eventually I’ll get it back via inflation,” but it’s your cash.   Just stop downvoting anything and everything that isn’t “            fuck the paper portnoys never fucking sell!!!”     Please, let us have discussion on other plays and move forward, even if you’re not willing to. Sincerely, WSB old guard.
Remember to stock up on AMC later today. AMC can still go to the moon since RH removed limits
I’M HOLDING MY BALLS I’M SQUEEZING THEM HARDER EVERY DAY I GOT BALLS OF STEEL PLEASE HELP ME OH GOD FINALLY THE RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED

It's funny
It's really funny how yesterday a lot of the mods that have been Running this place for the past xxxx time got booted of this sub and got replaced with fresh accounts that have nearly no (read less than 1k) karma . People who noticed this and spoke out got booted of the sub aswel. And now, today they entire sub is "gme is over" .. are People not Realising this is fishy?
Soon enough these diamond hands will turn into moon rocks   =>
Let’s show the Jordan Belford, Mark Cuban, and Elon Musk what were made of. Let’s prove their claims: we are a force to be reckoned with.   Holding 10 GME ~95$ Holding 7 AMC  $
The real VW GME Squeeze with crayons
$GME price drop is a proxy for what will happen to $TSLA once the hype fades out...
The clearinghouses fucked us and that's not ok
I get it, they realized they were going to go bankrupt from having to cover shares nobody had. They panicked. They screwed up and made a poor judgement decision by colluding to raise the margin requirements to buy stock using cash to obscene levels. They cancelled buy orders and added stop loss orders that were quickly gutted. This resulted in prices collapsing, and ultimately was market manipulation. This isn't just lost unrealized and realized gains, this also destroyed the value of calls I could have sold against my position once it hit my price target, so the losses go beyond just the stock value. I also suspect they were tipped off that shares were going to be sold, and I think people traded based on this inside information.  In short, I demand compensation for this error, and you should too. It's not enough that we sit on our laurels. We need to take action. There were a bunch of people and organizations involved here, including media outlets who knowingly spread false information to drive a narrative that was materially incorrect. It's not just the brokerages and Citedel.  We joke about lost tendies, but this is a big deal.
Theoretically if we never sell GME..
So I am curious if theoretically if we retards and dumbfucks here n worldwide never sell and keep on buying this shit show at this point and amass enough floating stocks (let's say 90%), what happens with the price?   How will it play out? How will it affect the present shorters and the effective run of the price? Other smart questions that I am too dumb to ask? Going by the general sentiment and a general sense of enthusiasm in spite of such a bad day, I am tempted to believe this is quite possible? Anyone willing to crease the brain?
Sue Robinhood
Robinhood robbed us.  Time to pay, boys.
I have a rule idea
It seems like a lot LOT of posts here are from BS accounts to trick rubes. There a guy on here saying he’s putting 200k on gme in am who’s account is 38 days old... I don’t buy it. And I don’t like how much of it gets through. Make a rule that your Reddit account be at least a yr old to post or comment- It’s not unreasonable and it’ll remove a lot of the lies from what has become much of this subs enemy... Plus it was about a year ago that wsb hit a million and that’s when the Dipshit’s started to take notice...
Someone needs to see this..
If $GME hits $250 again by February 12th at close, I’m going to donate a few switches & games to my local children’s hospital.
Hey guys! Many of us aren’t believers anymore, but I still am. You guys better hold me to this! I’m really looking forward to many of us making our money back with our diamond hands, as well as little kiddos getting to play Animal Crossing :)  Also I know a couple switches isn’t a lot, I’m a college student & don’t have the most expendable cash, but I’m here to do my part to give back!! I think if GameStop does ever go back up, a lot of us should think about giving back to our communities. We aren’t hedge funds who actually need these thousands of dollars, we are the common people, people who can actually do some good.  Thanks for coming to my TedTalk, I don’t know if there even is financial advice in this post, but if there is, there isn’t :)
Here is the story unpacked...
price point and they sure as hell fine there with the current pricing.   If they don't do their broad range of trickery (shutting retail brokers, media narrative manipulation, etc.) it probably would have gone up more but they wanted to shut it down, and guess what, they probably even made some nice money on it. I lost some too, will keep holding it as I don't see the point exiting with such loss.
Convinced my wife that we should drop 1k in GME. Got in at $320, wanted to sell when it hit $75 because of the sorry state of the sub, she said absolutely not, those are our grandchildrens stocks! We are in our 20s! She has the real
Fintel updated the way Short Volume is calculated
Hello fellow retards,  I will start off with saying none of this is financial advice, I can't even afford Excel.  That said, yesterday I copied the data from both Quandl(Data from Finra) and Fintel, just to see if they correlate and what percentage of trades are done through Finra registered traders. In the end it didn't seem to be relevant, or was prone to confirmation bias. The only thing I noticed was that the % of trades through Finra increased steadily after the initial rush last week. Here's the full graph:      So an hour ago I decided to update the graph with   values, and apparently Fintel just updated the way they calculate their Short Volume. Here are all the relevant links for the numbers:              This is where it gets interesting:      As you can see, the Short Volume Ratio increased massively over the last few days according to the new info, up to 69% (nice) on    Notice also how big the difference gets with each day: from 20% last monday to 45% this tuesday.   (Don't have old numbers from Fintel for  , but they would be around 13-14 million as the Finra data)  Now I am just a smooth-brained ape, but I thought this was pretty big considering how much their updated short volume changed. The way Fintel got their Short Volume numbers before correlates to Short Volume from Finra, but now the total volume they show is much higher.    If anything I wrote is wrong or completely retarded, please let me know, I will do my best to edit/remove the post if it's not right.
My Broker (DeGiro) send me a e-mail on which stock were traded most....
A recap
First they attacked the way we bought the stocks. Then they attacked us through news misinformation and bot spamming. Then they took down the mods that were holding the sub together by filtering the spam.    With these 3 moves  they managed to stop the momentum of our buying power, to sow discord in the unified sentiment  that people like the stock and shattered our morale.   Well played but the game is not over.  The morale is back since the mods that have been keeping the trash out are back, the sentiment will recover and now people can buy the stocks again.   I speak only for myself here   I L I K E T H E  S T O C K        to the   BABY   Also HF 🖕
If everyone buys and holds GME, does that mean we own GameStop now?  🤲
Guys it's fucking over, no hope left, no chance, it's done it's done, hedge funds always win, lost my whole life savings
Just kidding, i didnt hear no bell and the fat lady hasn't sung yet    till death! Retards hold strong!!  Not financial advice not financial advisor
$COCK
LONG ON $COCK! 🤚   Just put my life savings on it
What would you do if GME hit 1k.
Lemme hear it boys. I'd personally eat SECs moms ass.   A little chocolate mustache never hurt
WSB sub infiltrated
Seems like all the HF managers have their interns shitposting to sell in this sub.  WSB went from literally looking like Duke Nukem tea bagging the entire stock exchange to Luigi trying to explain the dangers of installing drywall.  Edit: word.
Possible Outcome
We all understand that the squeeze that happened a couple weeks ago was thanks to GME being shorted and being bet on to lose.  Now while GME is tanking and hit lower prices, surely HFs and traders will once again short GME? Probably double down and short even more compared to last time?  If this is the case, if we let GME keep lowering we once again have the potential to pull of a massive squeeze. One even bigger than last time.  Am I wrong in thinking this?  Edit: read what I'm saying before you comment. Use some logic and actually  discuss
STOP USING ROBINHOOD PLEASE
For your own fucking sake, and the sake of every retard here, STOP USING RH! Why would you go back to the platform who shafted us all? They did it when it mattered most, they’ll do it again when it’s to their benefit. Listen to what smart people like Mark Cuban are telling us, and use a brokerage that has trillions of $ behind it. Fidelity is a great example and quick to setup.   Don’t make the same mistake twice.
Can I invest in hedge funds?
I mean let's be honest, they are doing good work.  They are evil, but why not profit from it.
The Reckoning, past or future?
This is not financial advice. You would get better advice from a third grater.   A bit of a PSA before I proceed.  Do you know what YOLO means? Not the word but the intent behind the word? It means taking that 20K your old man left you when he died and putting it all on GME. It does not mean draining your life savings and ruining your marriage, your financial future, and so much more. You can absolutely be a retard with your money and not be a giant fucking idiot. You're not an investor if you do this. You're a gambling addict.  Now if you did this, and you're really that much of an idiot, all may not be lost. The best thing to do is to hold and pray for a squeeze. If not maybe you can hold onto it for a year or two and recoup a large portion of your losses if the stock goes up. But either way you need to acknowledge that you're a fucking idiot and shouldn't be anywhere near large sums of money and the stock market.     Now out of all the posts here giving non advice, one thing they all fail to mention. At the end of the day, it comes down to speculation. They speculate the stock is going down. They speculate it's going to go up. They speculate these are ladder attacks.  Nobody knows for sure what is going to happen, when, and how much it's going to drop/rise.     Final Stretch.  As we have seen, since the initial squeeze, the price has been steadily declining. So did we already get the big squeeze and it's all over or are we looking at another? The original jump to $400 I believe was a combination of short covers and reddit mania/retail buying. But not all the shorts were covered. These HFs can say they took billions in losses. But they don't tell you that they actually haven't cashed out those losses. They are waiting. Most of them have way smarter people than you and I(and likely don't mind breaking the law). What appears to be happening according to every ape on WSB that can screenshot a graph, is that they are applying a combination of selling shorts and ladder attacks. They are doing this to drive down the price while also making money in the process. With the amount of interest from reddit and every other retail investor, there is no way these HFs are not throwing in every penny they can to get that price down. Getting normies to paper hand is just a bonus.  And what happens when they get that price down? They are going to cover their shorts for minimal losses. MAYBE even come out with a profit. The legality of what is going on is beside the point. And what happens when they stop the ladder attacks and stop shorting, AND cover their shorts? Another huge jump in stock price. But when? The day before we find out how much short the stock really is. Why? Well, if everyone finds out they still have billions of shorts to cover, it's going to be a mad dash to buy as many of the stocks as people can before they cover. Then we will definitely know we are in a squeeze. They don't want that, so they are going to keep driving down the price and making money on more shorting before they cover their asses. And, in their mind, hope that the losses will be minimal. This would also explain the bailout by Citadel. They needed money to keep trading with to make their money back.  Again this isn't financial advice. I just heard it from the retarded monkey in my head over the screams for bananas.
We should encourage DFV to continue doing Youtube videos!!!
Well, DFV is fucking rich now but he should still continue Youtube and be a public figure. DFV has a much better analysis of stocks than most YouTube trader kids. He should give us some picks and help us build our portfolio. In response, we join his community by paying him. 8000000 degenerates with 10 dollars per month. We can make him fucking billionaire in a year or so!
Let’s GOOOO
I pulled out earlier today to let GME to continue to drop. Robin Hood removed restrictions. Balls deep part 2 (I’m pulling out the 9th if the short report is less than 50%
Retail investors lost 11x of what Hedge fund lost. How much you lost in GameStop.
It aint much but im doing my part. 🥳 👌
Evidence of Market Manipulation by Hedge Funds! Be careful, they’re controlling the narrative allowing retail investors to moon a stock and then collecting all the way down.
Now that RH limits are removed
Let’s make em hurt              Apes strong together.
Why don’t other billionaires (who don’t short sell) jump in on this? Especially if the short squeeze is possible?
One thing I don’t understand is, if there’s potential for a short squeeze (and there still is), why wouldn’t other insanely rich people who don’t have short stocks want to jump in on this? Wouldn’t that be a guaranteed victory at that point? Blackrock got 6 mil shares of AMC. Why not more? IF the share prices were shot up high enough, wouldn’t that guarantee a squeeze?
Thoughts on GME Divide
Hey dudes, just college student lurker that got caught up on the GME hype train and dropped a measly 2k @250 wanting to share my thoughts on the current split between everyone holding and everyone telling those who are holding that they're retarded for still holding  First of all, we're all retarded here so that doesn't need to be pointed out  Second of all, I feel like a lot of the    posts are just being fueled by bullish speculation while the posts callin out the dumbass    are fueled by speculation in the other direction (imagine being    lmao)  While I am still holding, and probably gonna buy more when it dips below 40, I do think that there is merit to both arguments. Just not when it's being backed up with speculation  Speculation: + price is gonna go up cuz of feb 9 short report!! + price is gonna go up cuz restrictions are gone!! + price is gonna go up cuz maybe papa elon or mama chamath will drop money on it!!  - price is going down cuz the squeeze already happened at 400!! - price is gonna go down cuz the shorts have already covered!! - price is going down cuz all the    fucked it for everyone!!  The point is all of these arguments are based on speculation and completely useless  Nobody knows how the short float report or the lifted restrictions is gonna affect the stock  Nobody knows whether the squeeze really did happen at 400 because the brokers fucked the momentum for the stock  Nobodt knows if the shorts have covered because the report hasn't even been posted yet and the last one was recorded up until Jan 15  All we know is that there was clear manipulation that completely fucked the stock while it was on its way up  The silver shilling and the news calling Reddit for market manipulation and painting this subreddit as the culprit  The brokers shutting down buying right as it was about to hit $500 before completely tanking it to $120  The SEC "investigation" that looked into this subreddit instead of Robinhood or Citadel or literally any other institution that was partially responsible for closing half of the trading system  All we know is that the trade restrictions have been halted and that the price is hitting (or about to hit) a very low and appealling price to people who were bullish on it anyway just based on its long-term fundamentals (Cohen and friends)  We know is that on Feb 9 a short report is coming out that could potentially change traders' opinions on the stock (or 15 idk ive seen that date being thrown around on this subreddit but I can't find a source on it anywhere for the life of me)  And we know that the shares are still FOR SURE being shorted  Whether you guys are bullish or bearish on the stock doesn't change the fact that things are happening behind the scenes and both sides have merit to their argument AS LONG AS IT ISN'T PURELY BASED ON SPECULATION (lookin at you retards tellin ppl to hold the stock cuz feb 9 is gonna be "the squeeze")  So next time you guys are about to call someone a retard remind yourself that maybe the autist on the other side of the special needs door might be on to something  But what do i know about financial advice, i only like the stock lmao $GME to $20k
Europe is with you!

I’ve gone full tard and it feels great
Hold and stand
United we stand, divided we fall. Don't let them discourage you. Hold and show them that we stand together. Don't let them divide us, we can do this, even if GME goes to zero hold and stand.
Looks like the chart got squoze
Old Gypsy Proverb: When you're drunk, the old whore taste like a virgin.
Something to think about for all retards Holding GME.
Just a thought...
If the SI% is reported on the 9th, and, hypothetically, there are still a lot of shorts to cover , would we see a spike (shorts covering) before the 9th or on the 9th/after ? I feel like if i was a shorter , i would wanna cover before the public knows that there is still a high SI%? No? But also i’m retarded so idk , interesting to hear other opinions.
Holding. No capital gains for me GME AMC
Why aren’t you selling
Half of everyone posting here about holding the line doesn’t own $GME  The squeeze is over  Stop trying to lose money   This is not financial advice  I’m 15 and an idiot and don’t work for a hedge fund and hold etfs like a pussy
Does anyone know where US senators and representatives post what stocks they've traded?
Under the US stock Act on April 4th 2012, every senator and representative has to constantly update what they've bough and sold, I remember there was a website that gave out not only frequent and in real time updates of what stocks were traded, how much, and how many, of which stocks each senator and representative traded.  But I dont remember the sites name, the only thing about it that I remember was that you had to be a US citizen in order for it to not only be legal.  Does anyone happen to know the name of the site? I'll keep looking but some help on finding it would be appreciated
I’m not selling.
It’s been a brutal beat down.     But that’s how I know we won.
Check my history
If their saying check my history, their a bot call them on their bluff check their history
We are done. Let everyone know that
We are done letting shills and hedgies suckers dictate the narrative here on WSB.   The last two days were pretty scary.   Not because of the all money that we are loosing (not really... You loose only if you sell. HOLD!!)  But because of the doubts we all had in this sub. Glad to see the doubts were totally unfounded and manipulated.  HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. GOOD NEWS ARE COMING.   Holding with you to the moon.
Serious  GME/AMC apes - consider how your sentiment can affect others
I understand that everyone can have their own opinion and are free to share it. However that does not mean it can't have negative consequences for the people around you.  I've read too many posts this week about 18-21 year old "investors" that have lost hundreds to thousands of dollars trading on margin and/or taking out loans.  This is getting out of hand and it's honestly concerning at this point.    -I'm not saying GME/AMC aren't going to mars but find a way to not bring some of these individuals along with you for the ride. They don't have the capital to continue investing in this manner     Please don't give me the fucking bullshit, "BuT ThEy DoNt NeEd To FoLloW OuR MoVeMent" or "GeT oFf ThE SuB".  Start fucking helping people again with real data and research. Believe me, the loss porn will still continue to come in.     Also, you're not fucking cute calling yourself a little ape and talking like a fucking retarded 6 year old monkey. These hedge funds are laughing at all of us right now because some of you dipshits turned this into some LARPing event.
Since the mods are back. Is this technically possible ? Specially the calling the votes means calling the shares back thing.

What I’ve learned by joining the Apes at the zoo (WSB)   NOT AN ADVISOR JUST A SIMPY SHRIMP
I learned a little bit by watching the craziness that’s ensued since GME first trip to the moon, but the first and most important rule I learned was to protect yourself (not an advisor) on every statement that involves stocks crucial and critical not to be liable for someone else listening to us be retarded and loving a stonk. Second but kinda important bit you’re not sticking it to the man by buying a stock, you’re literally paying him to spin the wheel to see if you come up rich. Which leads to something else that I have picked up that everyone is stressing and can’t be stated enough   DO NOT BUY STOCK WITH MONEY YOU DON’T INTEND TO LOSE!!   I’ve talked a friend down from putting second mortgage on their homes to buy in. Finally but big point research what you’re buying before buying. So moving forward no matter if you’re buying the dip, don’t buy the dip, waiting while lurking in the shadows,    , snorting AMC/NOK like a lab monkey with a ketamine addiction, or any of the other crap you see flying through here remember   APE STRONG TOGETHER
Fuck it next paycheck putting 4 more grand to gme 🙃
There are so many awards on all the posts on this sub recently it is actually ridiculous!
Although It is interesting to see so MANY being posted in such a short amount of time. Maybe it is because of all the new members, or all the gains recently. But it is, in a way, amazing to see . I have honestly never seen this before.
What stock trading apps except pre paid debit cards???
101/880
I bought .0301 shares of $GME and lost around $  if it makes you guys feel any better.
Robinhood has ended there limit on gme. To the moon?!   🙏🙏

Lets go MONKEYS
Left options (will exercise), shares right (i never sell shares sorry HEDGIES) IF YOU CANNOT HOLD WITH DIAMOND HANDS STAY TF OUT THE WAY; LET US BUY UP GME FLOAT and OTM CALLS AND REDISTRIBUTE THE WORTHLESS USD!!!!   🏻    🏻
post removed? Looks like bloomberg wants his terminal back

To the people of Italy where it’s almost 9:00. What can you tell me about the future?
Does GME      ? What are some other stocks I should buy right away?
holy smokes
holy moly!
Just set up some limit sell orders, now just sit back and wait for Melvin to be forced to cover their shorts?

Mods plese ban threads containing gme and amc
It’s over and the bagholders should accept it. You should only allow loss porn from them. Let’s bring the old wsb back.
People who are holding GME
An open and frank discussion about GME.
I know this has been done to death, but I'm still learning.  Is there any real way that GME ends well for the retail trader, or forces real change in financial circles?  As I see it Hedge funds probably opened up a load of new short positions above the $400 mark. But is there any way or really knowing if there are still any naked short positions, or is it all just guess work packed out with buyers looking for conformation bias?  Basically if we hold what are there still enough of us to make this work?  For reference I'm still long with money I can afford to lose I'm not asking this this to demoralise people, but just to help form a clear picture of the reality of the situation.  Thanks.  Oh and  🌕
Message to Mods - Boost our Moral; don’t delete anything that doesn’t have to do with GME .. I have faith in everyone, we can’t allow people to beat people up, now is the time to rally!!!!!!! We’re strong in numbers; let’s fucking show it!!!!
Quit bashing each other and come together, the unity we saw last week is so amazing it broke the system; this isn’t over... don’t listen to the nay sayers; fuck them!!!
Mods, Bring back the hip fire BAN HAMMER!!!🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨
Anybody around since before GME may recall the quickness a post could result in a ban.  There was a time where I might be banned just for mentioning the ban hammer.  But with the recent explosion searching for our “no social skill, autistic chart savant” DD needle has been dump trucked by “I do goofy things in front of my Family at Christmas I got into GME at $75 listen up” retarded hay.  If the mods want to attempt to gain any respect back from this shit show nothing would bring be more joy than seeing a post on r/conspiracy about how easy it was to get banned on WSB.  You wrote a DD post and didn’t post positions or actually admit you don’t have skin in the game just like the stock?  I’d be ok with just a hardline there too start. We have people that are incapable of even properly lying or too dumb to understand why no one cares if your not invested. . I’d be down for a thanos snap if I didn’t Think one of you would off yourself with your first Margin call without WSB Fs in the chat to help you easily find a response that explain what that means.   TLDR: Sub was 10x smaller MODS banned more-Sub went supernova Mods probably over run but have lost or sold their teeth.  Without a downsize there’s going to be a PC WSB snap chat show. And a strong black market for memes stocks to pump and dump.  Positions to verify I’m retarded not autistic and cause it’s still WSB to me damnit- Apple 140c exp 2/5-  was on super tilt from not doubling down on my expired worthless GME $27c exp 1/8 and greedy held through their record earnings for a new notch in the irrational dicks taken belt.  If I get banned for this do it quick while I’m still gaping.  Edit: spellin
Any advice is appreciated. Missed out on GME, but got AMC at $  and dumped at $18. What’s next fellas?
Final warning ⛔️
New
I'm new what should I do?? To get a great start
I'm at 60% loss with a significant amount of my savings into GME
I know it won't sound a lot to you and you owe me nothing, I'm not trying to tell you to hold.  I bought   @ 320, 1 @ 90 and   @   It's not a lot but it's all I had to lose at that point. I've felt FUD a couple of times over the past few days, here's how I dealt with it.  I set a goal :    Won't stop holding, even if that means losing it all.  I've been practicing meditation for a few years now, just being aware of the breath every time my mind remotely wandered towards FUD has helped tremendously. I've been able to cut down every episode of FUD to a couple of minutes and I'm retarded, if I can do it surely you apes can give it a try.  Whether you want to hold or fold is upto you, you are the master of your fate, whatever you do I'm with you.  I'm prepared to see the price be driven down to pennies, but that will only serve to strengthen my conviction, Big Money is trying every dirty trick at their disposal and I'm willing to soak all the blows. I will not yield because it's more than the money now for me at this point.   Over the past few weeks, they have tried to control the narrative in whatever way they could, it's doesn't matter, they can't win against someone who refuses to give in no matter what.   They've got more to lose than all of us collectively.      Mama raised no pussy
G M E to the Mecca. My paycheck going straight to these shares at Open today. Habibi Diamond hands only
I use Schwab right now and I am no paper handed bitch. Going to buy 2k worth of GameStop stock tomorrow. Holding since 238 and I ain’t fucking leaving. This has brought me closer to so many people and I learned so many lessons.   My final words before the blood bath tomorrow:  Teach those paper handed betas what they are missing.   Bring your habibi home. Hold the line. 🧑🏼‍ 🕋
GERMANY FIGHTING HARD - WE WILL MAKE HISTORY TODAY! 20$ EOD I DONT FCKING CARE. ROBINHOOD LIFTED ALL RESTRICTIONS ON TRADING. APES HOLD STRONG, RELOAD AND TOGETHER WITH AUSTISTS, RETARDS, WIFES WITHOUT BF, PAPA MUSK, UNCLE DFV WE WILL ARRIVE ON PLUTO. NOTHING MATTERS TODAY THAN GME AND AMC.
NEWBIE INVESTOR. DEFINITE RETARD!!

My whole family has been poor our entire, WHOLE , generational existence!!! im willing to bet/ lose and I want to turn things around for my family generationally.  any ideas on how to maximize my measly $100?? I have a pension every 2 weeks and am not self confident enough to risk my pension.... at the same time im not risking all my money and want to be a part of American History with holding some   my question is.... WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH $100 USD IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW?     im unemployed and definitely a retard. some guidance please? i even opened up a fidelity account and  new banking account just so i can participate. lets get to the moon.  Edit: Honestly thank you all for your advice and comments its all truly appreciated. Seriously. Thanks everyone.
We need to light this hype train and get GME trending on Twitter
This should be simple with the 6 million+ members of this community. Come on retards, get this shit going!
The correlation coefficient between $GME and $SAVA today was  , nearly unity. Video game retailer on one side, biotech on the other. There should be no correlation but for.... Both traded multiple $billions. #BigMoney building you staircases and knocking castles down. - Dr. Michael Burry
Respect, but did what was best for my family
Was in early. Sub 40. Sold around the 250 mark. My car had recently been stolen. I was 5k in the hole on the loan and some other debt from bad moves. Cleared all my debt and have a new car.   Amazing movement. I wish all of you the best. Wish I could have held but my 4yr old would not understand.   Diamond hands can mean more than one thing for one person. I wish everyone great fortunes. Gonna use GE as my saving account.
Well.. another hedgefond just made 700 million because they also bought GME
Fuck me. They bought at 10$ and selled at 400$ and all they did was followed Elon Musks Hype posts as signs..   Note: this is no negative post or something. I am holding everything I have from gme and amc!!! Love from Germany. Here, take a banana 🙉
Retards. I call upon you. Now is our time. Rise up.
Buy GME and AMC. Now is our time. Rise up and buy.
So what happens if we're right?
Look, I'm dumb, and on top of that I don't fully understand how hedge funds work, or even the stock market for that matter. But hear me out.  Say we're right, there are a lot of short positions open and the     don't sell until like $5000/share. Hedgefund is forced to buy back shares from us at these stupid prices, but they literally can't afford to do so, thus they can't pay back their debt to the institution they borrowed the stock from and thus declare bankruptcy.   What happens then?   The hedge fund gets liquidated to payback the lender as much as possible, the lender is stuck with some lost shares and we're stuck with the actual shares that suddenly nobody really wants or needs anymore. What then?
How do you find the move for next day? It’s difficult to find the targets since there are a lot of posts.
Question
no more RH for this retard
alright i’m over it. they fucking suck more dick than an asian whore. what’s the best in your opinion? CS, Fidelity (heard it’s the best) or Interactive Brokers? still only like a yearish into being a retard but my hands are feeling hot and my penis is telling me to make a decision asap
What if we did real estate
What if we did real estate and just started buying houses together
Let's stop the hedge fund market abuse together, Stop the many suicides and closure of businesses
I urge those who have had enough of the illegal operating of the hedge funds, to direct your complaints here      This market abuse is not welcome and should be stopped.   This market abuse results in 1000's of businesses going bankrupt and 1000's of suicides every year.   Together we can stop this and fight for change.
It is over apes? We lost? Now sit back and wait for another time to attack?
Serious GME question
So, I have almost zero experience in buying/trading stocks and I don't even really have a good grasp on margins and options but here is my question regarding GME and it's current state;  Wouldn't this be the perfect time to get in short? In at $50, out when it drops back to $4?   I know this isn't the popular opinion here and I'm not trying to provoke anything, just trying to clarify. At this point, this seems like the only smart move for someone with no current interests or positions in the stock.
The truth is right here.
Zack's still has AMC as a buy.
I know a lot of people hate Zack's but they're pretty conservative and most of their buys actually provide returns, proof is in their history. They maintain a buy for AMC at current levels, don't give up hope apes.
Thoughts on call for action for $GME?
MOVING FOCUS TO AMC
GME is down the drain. Take what you can and move into AMC. We close above   game over. Insane momentum going into weekend. Shorts will not wanna keep paying interest. AMC IS GOING TO THE MOON. I am not a financial advisor.             🏽 🏽 🏽 🏽 🏽 🏽 🏽
Can’t stop. Won’t stop. Game stop.
Obviously. I’m retarded
Holding into oblivion with you all. Its been a pleasure.   share gang   🏻
AMC mooning in germany. $8 premarket   go
Please see this and open your eyes
lost my last paycheck buying into GME at 300, what do I yolo my next paycheck into?
Stop acting like its over
We never saw the price go up they never unwound, only the bots are acting like something that never happened happen (probably going along with the false narrative of the news)     =    = Whinny post about it being over     Own GME at this point
Positive Start in Germany guys. We need to push one more time before the weekend. 🍀  🍻     🍀
Suck a fat one
Fuck this sub, full of misery bots trying to get you to sell W S B compromised, hold G M E at all costs.
Did anyone buy Apple Inc. before 2019?
Is there anyone around here who bought some Apple Inc. before 2019? How much did u guys make until now?
Thought with all this loss porn, some gain porn might be nice... cashed out on GME when it hit 300... never been happier
I’m dumb ape with dumb thought
REASON IM HOLDING        First off, sorry for the poor structure I’m on mobile.  Second disclaimer, I’m an idiot, full blown ape holding onto 1/4 of my hard earned 100% return in 8 long months of investing.        I’m going to hold until Cohen takes game stop to the levels we know it can reach.        Also because these  🤌🏻 won’t let go of this baby rocket, papa Elon hasn’t even installed the electric jets to the rocket yet.       Think, right now majority of games are sold/downloaded through Microsoft and Sony. Correct me if I’m wrong and there’s actually a 3rd party distributor (other than the publisher of course).   Now imagine these following possibilities   1) Downloaded games on hard drives can be saved and redistributed.                 A)You trade in your old Xbox or old play station. You can wipe the hard drives of personal data while saving game data... set new serial numbers to the data so it can be redownloaded and distributed to hard drives for future play/backwards comparability.                B) this comes with the possibility of game stop exclusive releases of new consoles with pre loaded hard drives that contain used games they’ve purchased off older hard drives.   2) game stop takes a more aggressive stance on the  competitive game scene with in person tournaments.                 A) possible partnership with twitch/other streaming services. This could happen sooner rather than later because multiple game stop locations could have large tournaments with retail locations around the world.                 B) with possible twitch partnerships this could bring revenue for more twitch steamer merchandise being moved in retail locations.    3) Sec finds shares of GME are in none existence and they fuck us over and claim x amount of “fake” stock will be reclaimed (maybe at face value) from the most recent x purchases.                 A) I’m holding onto what I got until the end, because a funny feeling tells me as this all plays out we might see some wild shit to say the least.                  B) until everything settles with the suits and the many lawsuits I’ll be holding my shares. Although if it drops below $30 I am eating it up, no crumbs left behind.                                          Summary                 I’m in no way a financial advisor, this is not investment advice. I truly like the stock and I believe with the growing possibilities for future e-game distribution and multiple innovative minds at the helm of GameStop, this train can turn around and bring us back to the     .   TLDR: I’m holding because it’s not a loss until you sell, and these  🤌🏻 are better than your grandmas spaghett.
What a lad!
What a nice world
You know it's nice to live in world where people like you exist, change my mind
If we stick together, we will win!
Copy/ Pasted: A message from Discord:   AN OPEN LETTER TO ALL! REPOST AND SHARE! @everyone  My fellow investors! These past few days have been challenging, we all know that! We have lost both brothers and sisters through the plague that is the hedgefunds scaretacticts via bots, trying to separate us.   We have come to a fork in the road, and while I know that following the advice on keeping it all going is hard. We all just need to stay put and have FAITH! All the right numbers are in place and it is a fact that the squeeze is coming sooner than later. We just need to see this through, not just for ourselfes, but for eachother!  We all have a dream! Not just to buy that Lamborghini... But to pay off medicalbills, help a parent, a significant other, be free!  Im certain if we all can stand resolute, we will beat these monsters!  SO FOR THE LOVE OF GOOD! TAKE A STAND, BOOST MORALE! AND HOLD THE LINE! WE ARE SO INCREDIBLY CLOSE! /DanielL

" Many smaller investors use options to play the market. One such contract  gives an investor the right to sell a stock at a later date at a  certain price. If the share price drops, the holder can exercise the  option and sell the share at the higher option price. Such options help  investors protect their portfolios against sharp price declines. "

3rd day for Pending Settlement! You know what this means!!
Ok guys, I don’t know what is going on. But I just checked my account and I found out the 10 shares I acquired on 2/2 is STILL in pending settlement, isn’t pending settlement take just 2 days?   If I’m wrong then oh well, but what if they’re super close to running out of shares?? That means the squeeze could happen any day!!   Can anyone check their accounts to see if it’s the same for you too?
Read this or don’t. It’s your money.

I’m new to this whole thing, any tips for beginners?
Also, what’s the deal with amc? Should I hold, and if so, for how long? I only have $100 put in because I’m broke.
Hop on the ZOM rocket
It's still cheap enough and it's a solid company with actual promise. Let's support ZOM and maybe make some gains?  None of this shit is financial advice I just fucking love my ZOM stonks
Still holding here. We cannot win. They play by different rules.
I was one of the first ones to ride this wave. I bought a couple of times, and till date, I haven’t sold (“it’s not about the money, it’s about sending a message”), but I think it’s time to realize that we have been hunted like gazelles crossing a crocodile-infested river. They make the market, they influence the market, and more importantly, they set the rules.   I know I might be downvoted to hell but I wanted to share my piece of mind. I put money here without a care about losing it. If you put your life savings in... well, you are in trouble, to put it mildly.   There is still a lot of optimism running in this sub and I don’t blame them, but I wanted to share my piece. Besides, I will keep holding anyway.   Good luck to all of us, it was nice while it lasted.
DFV will sell today. Remind me when this happens.
what the title says - gme will be up slightly and dfv will know it is the final push before the inevitable return to earth.

At what price will these hedge funds break even?
Sooo... if a movie is made may i recommend a title?

Robinhood Lifted All Restrictions on AMC and GME. Now's the time to buy!
Whether you use RH or not (don’t), there are now more people who can buy shares. This is what Mark Cuban said would drive the price up. Round 2 of the fight begins Friday. Buy AMC and GME and send them to the moon
Is u/deepfuckingvalue still holding $GME?
All hope is not lost
I remember when this stock climbed to 78 and I thought "fuck I wish I bought more at 38"  I remember when it climbed to 150 and I thought "fuck I wish I bought more at 78"  I remember when it climbed to 400!!! I thought "fuck I wish I bought more at 150"  The stock is around the 50 mark and I AM going to buy more of this stock  Worst comes to worst and the squeeze isn't squozen. I have invested in a growing company that has made some big announcements in the last few days. Given a few years time I believe I will have made my money back and then some.  Not financial advise and do your own research etc etc. Please be careful and take care of yourselves
What's the end goal for WSB?
I love what has happened over the last few weeks with WSB however it seems things are declining a bit. Not that I ever saw the movement to be super organized but I definitely saw the potential of it doing a lot more to encourage those who feel voiceless to speak up.  Now, I am just seeing people shilling different projects, referral links to exchanges and pumping non-sense projects that will only rekt people in the end.  There is a telegram group for wallstreetbets, not sure how legit it is since I do not see any links for it here but it's pure chaos in there. We must do better folks.  So I ask, what is the overall plan to stay relevant and continue to prove to the suits that the people are in charge and are woke instead of just being a meme movement that made a few headlines and then crashed an burned because of egotistic behavior?
Who will be watching Feb 18th?
I know I will be tuning in.   Prior relationships have a tendency to influence people and their decisions.  We must trust/ hope those in power do not allow their prior relationships (both business and personal) to influence and cloud their vision and decision making process.   I will be actively contacting my elected officials if anything seems askew with the proceedings.
I   ed Dragon Oil for more than a decade. Thought it was a loss.
Bought in on a rumour I heard around my dad's office, got something close to 1 pound per share. Don't remember the date but pre 9/11  Share price plummetted, I took the L and threw the paperwork in a pile of stuff I'd never bother sorting out. Moved on with my life.  In 2015 I received a letter at my mother's address (yeah...) asking me to vote in favour of selling at 8 pounds per share so they could go private. Put the tendies toward a better car.  What I'm saying is you don't need to sell to take the L. And if anyone is planning a wsb rap you have my permission to take that line.
My Joerney with GME
Okay guys first my situation: I am 19 years old and studying I earn around 450€ (which I complete Safe for future rn) a month and my savings are around 5k€. I am specualating with stocks around 6 months now and I wouldn’t say I am a complete noob. I invested 1k+ of my money and was doing okay. Then gamestop come up I just observed it in the first weeks to understand the situation. Last weeks Monday I started with daytrading GME since it was so volatile. I bought at 240€ and sold at 300€. (I did this 2 times and made a solid profit of 100€) Last Thursday before the robinhood event I got greedy and gone all in (bought 3@330€) since it was only raising each day. For my bad it was only going down from then on. Every hour I checked this reddit for news. Almost everyone of you is saying hold but still nothing changed. Today I decided to sell 3@50. I lost 850€ which is a punch in my face.  I sold bc of 2 reasons. Reason 1 is to don’t loose all(I probably could sell at a better price maybe 60-80€ but at this point I don’t care about 50-100€ more) Reason 2 is the big punch. My family is relatively poor and 1k is much for us. We will not die or anything without this money but still it was hard to convince my parents to get myself into stocks(even if it is my money) . From now on they  want me to stop with stocks(which i did only for my future so I can learn until I earn a big amount of money and invest 500€+ a month) And it is going to be much harder to convince them to let me spend money to start a business (or whatever things there are which requires you to spend money on before you can start making some)(for example I did reselling shoes or building website and so on)   My advice for you is do whatever you want lol.

Can someone who thinks the squeeze already happened, explain this?
I'm not sure where these numbers come from, but if they are legitimate, doesn't it means that the real squeeze is guaranteed to happen?   I've been seeing a lot of people spamming    with no evidence to support why they think it will go up. I've seen the same from the other side, with new accounts making fun of people for bag holding with no evidence that the squeeze happened.
It does hurt
Being an adult ape.
First GME 4s $145/share. Riding to zero or Valhalla. or buy a put tomorrow then exercise at bottom for the actual squeeze.   Some of you are learning adult shit currently. you are learning you are impulsive and scared. You see green dildos and get happy and red dildos makes you panic sale.  Why do you feel that way? Because you didn't write down when to get in or when to get out. How much are you willing to set on fire or try and save.  you just saw dollar signs and acted like a child.    What is occurring is separating the children from the adults.   Not on who is    or 📜 .    It is those that accept the outcome and those that are bargaining on this is how we can still win or bitch that you lost x.   Adults accept the decisions they make. They make adjustments and learn from their mistakes. They don't keep coming up with excuses  or finding further justification for a decision they already made.    You bet your X and lost it all because you saw a meme? Accept that you are an idiot and don't do that next time. Expensive mistake but one i hope you don't repeat.  Take some time off and then come back with a plan.   Know what you can lose and accept the outcome. be it rocket ships or lent in your wallet.   old saying hope for the best plan for the worst.   you will sleep a lot better once you do.

I’m holding despite an 80% loss. This may be the smartest dumb move I’ve ever made!
New here. Just bought another $200 worth of shares. I’m in til $1k. Fuck these bots. HOLD THE LINE ENERGY UP BABY!
Just a morale post since the coup happened. The trade volume is low it’s all fucking theatrics right now. They are out of tricks. Shares are at a LOW. BUY THIS DIP! I am a lowly waiter but I’ve invested at the top at $325 and the very bottom at $50. Fuck it, let’s get it. Trade restrictions are off... we can leverage this big time but we need morale UP and HOLD YOUR FUCKING SHARES. Never take a loss! Chewy is a $50bil company. HAVE FAITH. No one said this would happen in a week. This could take a while but JUST FUCKING HOLD. Yeah yeah not a lot of emojis but fuck all that, we’re in this together and no one will see this post most-likely but GET MAD AND GET EVEN. These fuckers don’t give a shit about us. Mark Cuban even went on to say we need to HOLD. DO NOT SELL. Reading everyone’s DD we have them right where we want them. Let’s get a big push tomorrow and no matter what DO NOT SELL YOU PUSSIES. They have pulled out all the stops, but let’s show these bitches what the fuck is up tomorrow. We are many and they are few. Let’s take these fucks down and show them that they have no idea who they’re fucking with. We are the free market, not them, and if they doubt that, bitch, here we come!
You’re trying to tell me there’s NO WAY for retail to counter the short ladder attacks??? I don’t believe it so what do we do?
380 AMC Shares Queued up to buy at market open. We’re back boys

I say that for 2 reasons:       SSR is in play again;   No more Robinhood restrictions.  Let's get some momentum!
I probably should have sold, if I was a pussy  🙏

Guys. I feel so bad. I bought 4 $GME at like 300 and now they’re only worth
EXACTLY 4 $GME IT’S NOT A LOSS UNTIL YOU SELL     I am prepared to hold to 0
Am I Doing This Right?
I want to buy GME at like $25. One more red day before moon?
I don’t trust buying for more than $15 tbh but the likelihood of it hitting $500 again is impossible but $25 into $500 is a 20x bag insane. Give a day or two for a few of us to be millionaires with zero risk at a buy of $3 per share
Europe is doing its part to hold GME  🤲
Turned 300 to 900 this week. Just for fun. Of course I got flagged as a patter trader for this!
$  billion Ponzi scheme defrauded 17,000 investors, SEC says
Literally two days ago Billionaires were crying on live tv. Just look at how they sabotaged $GME. Wait til the 9th when we know what the actual shorting interest is. From the DD I’ve seen from people around here, it’s def way higher than you’d think.
To the moon fellow primates. Hold and To the moon we go
Mark Cuban on CNBC: “Wall Street cannot stop the beast they have unleashed. They slowed them down, temporarily, but they’ll never stop Reddit.”
the DTCC exposed
for those that are wondering what happened, did the shorts cover yet? ask yourself this  what do you think they were doing when they restricted BUYING? how did it go from $100-400 when no one could actually buy? maybe because they were the only ones BUYING and covering their shorts, then shorting it all the way down to $50 now (meaning they doubled down)  you don't need to see the reports when you understand the mechanics and the obvious reason they restricted buying for EVERYONE BUT THEM (fraudulent covering technique)  so some of you may be asking then, how does this work?  let me break it down for you  it's quite simple, basically, you are allowed to sell shares (short sell), without even having the borrowed shares in your possession (which ends up being a failure-to-deliver)  meanwhile, if there's too much buying, the very same people (DTCC) that allow  infinite shorting,  turns off buying, by increasing "capital requirements", preventing infinite squeezing. basically, one side is capped, but not the other. and the cap, just so happens to give the   shorters, the      perfect opportunity to cover, and double down.        aka, the game is rigged, and GME exposed it       THE GAME MUST BE STOPPED, GAMESTOP

The lurker lessons of lord PRPL regarding GME
I’m a lurker   I’m a peeper   I’m an everyday creeper, And I buy my positions in the long.      One time WSP was laying down sick DD on PRPl I don’t listen. By the time it hit my smooth sac it was topped out. That’s when I bought.   50% loss  69% loss  Etc    Eeeehhhhh ‘ Forget about it ‘    A few months later i closed at 12% gain    GME going to rocket rocket rocket   I should wait   GME Mooooonnnnn!   Ok I buy : 360   Ok it’s crashing I buy again : 189   Oh shit I need to PRPL : 59     I’ll see you smooth brains in 69 months when this stonk is worth $    WSB goes up. PRPL gang forever!
In what way can GME not recover
Hey, new here, learning on the job essentially. From everything I've read and understood it seems impossible that we retards and autists lose, but in what way could we lose, I haven't really seen anyone talk about it.
Blood, sweat and tears don’t stop holding my WSB brothers this the real dip!!!          🏻 All the way.
$UBER thoughts on 2/10 Earnings Call
UBER rideshare obviously down right now due to Covid but stock is doing ok. 81% analyst buy rating yet more restaurant businesses are encouraging takeout and some are reopening.   Analysts expect earnings to match Q3 but I can’t understand how. Mild winter has helped a bit with rides and deliveries but I’m just not seeing it or hearing it from anyone.   Business travel is basically nonexistent which was a big market. We used to have lines of cars waiting to pick people up at the airport.   This is not investment advice but someone please tell me to cancel my market open PUT at $  before the morning.    Current price   just need a 5% drop by 2/19 after earnings call disappoints to basically make a few 🍗🍗🍗🍗.
Not as bad as some of y’all but I’m still holding!
Wish we could file a lawsuit
This is not financial advice  Regardless of how this plays out if we all hit the moon or crash into the ocean i feel there needs to be something done. When the companies like RobinHood, Ameritrade, cash app, and others decided to block trade purchases, that single handily changed the game. Then the mainstream media reported on how bad the “Reddit stocks” were, trying to paint a negative picture and misrepresented the situation. When in all reality one of the MAIN REASONS the stocks fell was because the brokers limited the purchases and stopped people from buying all together. If only there was a way of suing.

ROBINHOOD LIFTED BUYING RESTRICTIONS
POSITIVITY IS BACK! 🤩
Glad to see the positivity in the thread is back. Was getting slightly worried and not sure if it had to do with all the craziness going on with the mods, but, whatever it was, glad to see everybody is doing okay!  Edit 2/5/20 6:47 AM: Wow, I didn’t expect everyone to be so active on this! This has been a great birthday so far, and it’s all because of you guys. Thank you for the kind words and the awards! Keep your heads up! GME TO THE MOON! (Spend your award money on stocks you like, not me!)

/r/WSB Lessons Learned 1/25 - 2/05 2021
Let's reflect for a minute on things that we have learned in the last few weeks.   1. The media is used to manipulate market sentiment and build counter factual narratives.  2. Retail investors have power in numbers, but (for now) cannot control the narrative.  3. It's easier to spread pessimism than hope. Shorts have the easiest narrative. "If it bleeds it leads."  4. Brokers, Prime Brokers, and Clearing Houses need much more scrutiny, these are the true whales.  5. Retail fighting against Prime Brokers and Clearing Houses is like picking up pennies in front of an invisible steam roller. Be careful.  6. Order flow is more important the capital flow.  7. Short interest reports are essentially meaningless due to time delay.  8. Something very strange went on with all of the BANG stocks and several other stocks. Forensic accountants will be all over these two weeks. Expect at least one book explaining what happened.  9. The SEC only gets involved after the fact, not during an event.  10. The meme economy is real. We blew up Robinhood using nothing but memes.  11. Citadel is named appropriately.  12. Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry is himself a black swan.  That is all.
Any news on the AMCs?
Are we gonna save AMC like y’all did GameStop
I heard I can post this here for some free karma
/r/wallstreetbets can retaliate against Robinhood
I bet we could crush robinhood by banning any images of the robinhood platform, linked or posted. Robinhood is super design centric and they’re struggling right now so if we can get eyes off of the nice charts all people will see is the terrible they do in the news lol  Edit: to be clear I think we should only ban images of robinhood keep all text and link posts
To every one saying "after all this, I'll switch from Robinhood"... there's not going to be a fucking "after all this" if you stay on Robinhood! What don't you 🦧retards understand?
You know by now that Robinhood is under Citadel's thumb. You should've known this since LAST fucking Thursday. I guess start buying from Robinhood since the restrictions are lifted now. But at least open a damn fidelity account so you can start depositing money over there while we wait.  GME TO THE MOON, I still think we can do it, guys. Let's just get our shit together.    🦧     🌞🌞🌞🌞
Are ya winning, son?
Morgan and Morgan to file class action.
Here's the link:      Next thing is: they're asking if you tried to SELL. Not BUY. Wtf?
ATTENTION: Calling all Gamers
Boys and girls, window lickers and apes, I know this week has tested our resolve (aka our retardation).... BUT what is one valuable lesson we have all learned from video games??? When you encounter resistance, enemies, having the cards stacked against you, what does this mean??   It means you’re going the RIGHT FUCKING WAY!!   As many others have said, if the shorts covered all of their positions already, why would they expend so much time and energy telling us and the media that? If they had won and were confident in their victory, why would they even acknowledge our acoustic existence? I’ll tell you why, because they know they’re in DEEP and the power of the whole always outweighs that of the few. NEVER let anyone, rich or poor, strip you of your power, your sense of community, and your dream of a better future.   This is our final boss battle, it may take days or weeks or months but we are ultimately in control of our outcome. Buy if you want to, sell so your wife’s boyfriend can buy more shares, and HOLD WITH THOSE GLORIOUS DIAMOND HANDS  🏻   🏻 !!!   Not financial advice, use whatever brain you have left to make your own decisions.   I am holding with you my friends (40 @ $94)   And remember...  Power to the Fucking Players    🏻 !!!
About those pesky ads…
A Better idea
ROBINHOOD REMOVES TRADING RESTRICTIONS HOWEVER...
If you are still using Robinhood to buy shares then you are truly an absolute fully fledged cocksucking retard. The hedgie kind. Robinhood will undoubtedly restrict it again if it comes to it.
Story Time from pits of the CBOT
I interned at a proprietary trading firm for a couple of summers. I basically got paid to smuggle lunch onto the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade. They made markets in the Spoos, which are big S&P 500 futures contracts, 250x mutiplier (instead of the normal 100).\  They also made markets in the E-minis, SPX, and the OEX (S&P 100 contacts).   \  A single Spoo future today has a notional value of around $950,000. These guys traded fucking size.   The head trader, Ben (not his real name), was trying to sell a shitload of way out-of-the-money puts, which would’ve made hundreds of thousands in premium, which is a lot of money for a 12 person operation. This was also during the 2017-2018 low vol markets, which was brutal for index market makers. At the time, the firm was doing a lot of business through a guy named Mike (fake name), who was a show broker (a guy who works with big clients and sends potential orders to market makers). Ben was trying to do a not held order, which is giving the broker time and price discretion; basically trusting Mike to get the best fill possible. We just got a message on the order, and Mike filled it at a shit price and a far lower quantity than we wanted. Ben got fucking angry and blurted out this absolute gem:    "Tell him to fucking suck it, tell him to fucking blow me. He won’t do it and then he’ll laugh in our face about it like the cunt that he is. He’s got a pool of guys allergic to water.”    Good times
Anybody need advice?  🏾
To gme holders
Lol
"It is over" the news cries while still pushing silver! ("Supercharged gold" because it is used in solar panels)
AMC
This is my opinion but I feel like Robinhood took off the restrictions because the prices of most stocks that were short squeezed are already back down, most hedge funders are probably out and are chillin now. If we keep buying they’ll just follow and make even more and they’ll sell those shares and drop it down which will fuck us over. Don’t bet against these hedge funders because they know the game better then most of us and they won’t get fucked over a second time.
I'm holding, because I don't know shit about the stock market, but I feel like...
these hedge funds were on the line to buy back a bunch of shares they sold on loan (the reason this bubble bubbled), they've done so during this price plummet. Again, though, I don't know what I'm talking about, but I trust my instinct in other areas of life, and this is what it's telling me now. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to make a huge profit, but it seems like desperate hope at this point. Am I wrong?
Rip homie
Not planning on buying these levels. Just setting up my retail atack for tomorrow. 1 share at a time.
Listen up!!
Seriously considering scamming RH
I have the sudden urge to deposit more money than I have on RH and just gamble it all and see what happens. I’m about to close my account so I don’t have any money in there for them to withhold. Would they just fuck up my credit score if I lost money I didn’t have and didn’t pay it back? Seems worth it to me. Would love to rack up tons of debt for this shit company and never pay it back just to increase the odds of them going bankrupt  Edit: ok I won’t do it. Everyone pointed out i just admitted to fraud so haha its all a joke 👮‍♀️👮‍♀️👮‍♀️ it’s funny how robinhood could declare bankruptcy and all our assets would disappear for months and there’s nothing we can do about. I know it’s insured but time value of money and shit....
If $GME$ hits $200 this week I'm buying this
Here's a playlist for tomorrows GET
Listen to this poorly put to gather playlist feel free to go full ape   🙈
Guys, I sold...
SOLD AN OTM PUT THAT'S NOW UNDERWATER.  You know what that means?        It means once it's assigned to me, I'll be holding even more shares.  Let's go!  (shhh, don't mention the loss I'm taking on the OTM calls)
If we hit the top we would have seen an offering

Time to Show Some Respect
Whether you sold GME (like a paper-handed noob) or not is up to you. But if you sold it, show some damned respect to the holders that held through the highs. Stop with the sarcastic "told you so" or "I saw it coming, why couldn't you" comments. This was never about logic or smart decision-making. It was about values. The holders stood for something greater than themselves.   Trading's a zero sum game. Many of us were bound to be left behind in this game. To those that held and lost money, great respect to you. If this were a physical war, you'd've won the Purple Heart. Whether you own one share or many thousands of shares, you've been partaking in something that will not be replicated again until many decades later. That has to count for something. Money isn't everything. Even on WSB. The faster you realize this, the better you will trade, not that it's a 1:1 relationship, but somehow it holds true all the time.   They can take away your money, but your dignity and honor, that, no one can ever take, other than yourself.     Positions:   I never Yolo'd into GME/AMC/NOK, but I'm bag holding enough shares and calls to feel uncomfortable. The Hf's probably covered most of their shorts at this point (definitely not all).     So what's the play?   Well Robinhood lifted restrictions. We're at an ath in terms of new retail money flowing into the markets, and hf's are literally looking to rotate from the ath qqq and s&p stonks to try out one of the stonks we like. I mean, Blackrock increased their positions in AMC and Nok for crying out loud.   Thus, experience tells me that it's better to hold, because there'll be some kind of mean reversion.   Or shall I say meme reversion.
If GME would have been at it's actual price on Monday, then we would have already won
On Monday people saw this decrease as a great opportunity to buy again, everyone was ready to fight.  And I just realized now why the people who are currently manipulating the market to lower it didn't go all in on Monday, because they were well aware that if the price drop to 50 when everyone was still so hyped, they would have take the hugest backslash in history. So they decreased in a way that was the most painful to all of us, to divide the most people possible.  For my part I'll hold till 0, and I will take my eyes off the negativity because I just want to like the stock  Ape. Strong. Together.
about GME
My position was 70 shares at $164  Now I cant sleep well cuz its going down everyday  And the fucking SEC maybe ruin us  (DFV is no longer share his position）  Should I still hold ..?
They remove limits GME AMC
My brother-in-law’s insight on GME
My brother-in-law is a funny 40 year old white dude who is pretty smart and does well for himself. We were texting back and forth yesterday, and he sent this below. I’d love to hear everyone’s feedback.   “Gamestop is not looking good. I wonder if everyone is jumping ship or going to wait it out. I'm starting to think there is a bigger conspiracy going on. Reddit deepfuckjngvalue and wallstreetbets actually sold out to robinhood/citadel/melvin months if not years ago. Hear me out. They pick a stock or stocks with a feel good vibe like gamestop, amc. Beloved icons of our youth.. next they expose it being shorted by hedge funds, not to screw the hedge funds that yes, actually lost money up front, but convinced every average Joe, or retard, to invest heavily in the stock. Hedge funds lost and they made that public to fuel more cash from everyone. Once it hit high, the hedge funds stopped buying ability and once again shorted the stock with huge returns. If they shorted it at $40, imagine shorting at $400 so more value. All the while they tell people to keep investing and hold. So they basically convinced everyone to invest their money, lose their ass, and hedge funds still win. I bet they are laughing because people literally call themselves retards now. They orchestrated the entire thing. Reddit and hedge funds biggest conspiracy ever! Nobody will go to jail. Same shit different scenario. Investors got duped again, bunch of retards throwing money at something for a cause not knowing how these things work so they are now broke. Elon musk. He's in it too with his tweets. Only guy that got fucked was Portnoy because he was not one of them.
#GME & #AMC all day, me and multiple friends also like the stocks this evening.... Discounts only while supplies last! FOR GLORY!
PLEASE READ: I am your Filmmaker
PLEASE READ: I AM YOUR FILMMAKER  Hello, my name is hollywood_harpoon  I have a verified 10 year account, but you will never hear from me because I have no karma. I’ve never needed it before before this moment. You all have dug deep, and if you are going to fight legendary battles you are going to wake legendary beasts. Ive broke radio silence to stand with you. You think Balrogs give fuks about Karma? Im awake and want nothing more than to stand beside you in this moment, all I hope is that my voice can make it to you.  I have never cried harder in my life than today, but I want you to know what I am about to tell you is no sob story, because of you all, these tears are diamonds running down my face!  I am a 15 year veteran of filmmaking in Hollywood. I have been in the trenches with the best of them: Malick, Speilberg,   and at least 100 other directors. I know the moderators are looking for a film maker and I want to tell you I am your guy.  Right now the moderators are looking at a lot of director’s high light reels, I know exactly the type of people submitting, it’s the same people who have been passing me by in promotions all my life, just because their parents can afford them all the money in the world to make their reels, I know these people inside out and I can hear their nervous jabbering from here and it greatly annoys me.  I don’t have a flashy reel to show you, all I have is the most retarded website with the most retarded film on it. Please take a look.   . What you are looking at is legitimately dumb, it’s a website that I put all my money into 8 years ago, trying to sell one shirt that reads, “Property of The   Banking System”. The still is from a short I directed, predicting the Caveman rioting at the capitol 8 years before it happened. People thought I was dumb then, and I haven’t done a damn thing to change their mind since.  I only sold 1 shirt in 8 years, to my mom, because she is the only one that believed in me. Today, I found out she might have Covid on the same day she was due to get her first shot of the vaccine, and she is very high risk. I’m stuck in Australia and wont be able to make it back in time to make sure she will be ok.  Why would I ever keep a website up for 8 years when it has only sold 1 shirt? Because, when I believe in something I hold onto it!  Why am I holding GME?  Because, I remember when I was 19 years old driving an ambulance for Rural Metro in Arizona. We were making minimum wage and 2 weeks before we were to unionize we were all laid off. At that moment there was only two things I knew. 1. There was nothing I could do. 2. One day, I would be back for ALL of these mother fuckers!  I remember working as a security guard at a hospital when a lot of us were about to get our 1 year raise, they told us they didn’t have it in the budget. That same week they unveiled a very flashy, very expensive and big, plasma TV in the lobby showing nothing but a digital fish tank. I still think about that fish tank sometimes before I go to sleep. Remember this: Sometimes the biggest regrets you make; are of all the things you didn’t break!  I remember working 90 hour weeks for Inarritu on, The Revenant. I loved the work and still love the film, but I lost my health insurance working for him.  Ive spent the last 3 years homeless, staying in the seediest parts of the world, but for me, they have been castles because I get to do something I believe in. I wouldn’t have it any other way, Im retarded like that!  Im so retarded, after 15 years of hard work, my greatest achievement is a stupid little article written here, read to the end and see if you can guess who I am.    So, Im sure whoever the mods find for their filmmaker will be just fine. But, if I ever meet that filmmaker in person, Im going to crush them with my balls just because I can. I made you a dumb little video but I don’t think I can ever get it on here, I don’t know if you will ever hear me. These mods are a little dumb, even for my taste, and I eat dog shit for living.  My name is Hollywood_harpoon, because my people are whale-hunters, Inupiat Eskimo from the arctic circle. I was born a whale-hunter, I am sure as fuck going to die a whale-hunter.  I was born for this moment and been working hard for it and I brought the receipts,    I don’t have much, but everything I have is with you. If I have to go back to the streets and eat dog shit tomorrow, I want you to know, it will be the greatest meal I’ve ever had, because for the first time in my life, I will be eating at the table of Kings and Queens.  Fuck Covid. Fuck homelessness. Fuck poverty. Fuck Inarritu. Most of all, fuck these Hedge Funds!  They say there are no atheists in fox holes. Fuck that! The only gods I need are the ones standing beside me in this battle. Im a whale hunter and will always be a whale hunter.  These are diamonds falling from my eyes.  Ill hold, I like the stock!
seruasly!
Why we holding?  ?¿... I'm genuinely asking
Sompos Holdings PLTR YOLO! 107 Million shares

Learn from this Gamestop Experience!
A lot of you have little to no experience trading g stocks and options.   It takes a lot of losses, some wins, smart position sizing and plenty of frustration to be successful at trading.  Emotions have no place in trading, never get emotional about a stock, it doesn't care about your sorry ass one bit.   Most people trade on emotion, they get FOMO and buy near the high. Then get scared and sell at the low   The market is designed to take advantage of your fear and greed.   Gamestop holders won the battle, but failed to take advantage of it   selling the stock at $300 to $400.   The stock is worth maybe $20, but you guys pushed it to over $400 because of the crazy high short interest,  your buying and online marketing. ....Amazing.  You guys should have been selling GME at $400, the stock was insanely overvalued at that price, that was your win. Then you should have joined the sellers and bought puts and/ or short it back to $100.  Then you might have had enough money to make a real statement for the next target.  The system will not let you destroy it to make a statement, so you should not be surprised that it changed the rules when it was threatened (this has happened many times in history)  If you really want to change wall street, it will take massive amounts of capital transferred from them to you to use against them next time.  Holding to zero and crying because GME didn't go to $1000, will not do shit. Live and learn.
HOLD!
Holding till the 🌕 or hell.     🖖🏽     Hold tight moose knuckles
If we at WSB need to show we really can pull it off again, spread the word and let's get AMC to 200. They will never mess with us again
Best time to hop on the band wagon? $GME
Just opened a WeBull account (not currently on Robinhood or anything else) and I wanna hop on the bandwagon. I have to wait a few days for the account to clear bc I guess they wanna make sure I'm a real person or something. In either case, how soon should I hop on GME? I'd be doing so to hold, obvi

Too late for $WKHS?
punching my dick for not getting in on this late last year.   does literally everything hinge on this USPS contract? After doing some more reading, one one hand the Biden announcement/hype about converting the govt fleet to EVs makes this feel like it can shoot up more over next month or so. But I can’t shake that Biden’s endorsement is more for show vs. a dictation of what the USPS will actually do.   WKHS is a startup with production limitations, their largest order ~7K. There is no shot they would be the sole winner of this contract with that lack of experience and resources.   The USPS is also not federally funded and they will have to pay for the vehicles. I can see this becoming very bureaucratic, with the USPS cheaping out opting for short term cheaper costs vs. long term savings. EVs tend to be higher upfront cost but save you $ on maintenance blah blah blah.   So idk, ultimately I’d guess WKHS gets a portion of the contract to save face for Biden and the govt “going green” but with Ford in the mix and their production infrastructure/deep roots in American culture and prob the govt, I can totally see them getting the lions share of the   being spun  as “creating American jobs for one of the greatest American car companies etc.”  Idk, might throw a call in it. I like the company and that they’re kind of an underdog in some ways, since this was a penny stock less than almost half a year ago. but not sure if the money boat has already been missed and gains ahead are limited.   Thots ?
Hold the line
Deep thought
With AMC being a stock crushed by COVID over the past year, and likely to improve in 2021 with vaccinations and people dying to go to the movies.... I don’t know how you can call yourself a RETARD if you’re not in this stock at 7 bucks.. I bought 400 at   and no way I’m selling this before it doubles.  Squeeze or no squeeze.        I am not a financial advisor (obviously... I’m posting to a bunch of autists, no offense).
You guys are acting like this is the first time you've made a bad financial decision involving GameStop
The GME movie deal
Ok we are all know people are already talking about a movie or documentary about the shit that went down over the last month. My idea someone needs to call Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell do the movie and make it a sequel to THE OTHER GUYS
As Mark Cuban said; “When the brokers quit restricting the market, we’ll see what WSB is truly capable of.”
also; “hold if you can afford”  listen up fellow apes. gme and amc are at it’s lowest price point, im a degen but wait 25 mins and make a call to BUY THE DIP TOMORROW MORNING AFTER OPEN! this is just an idea, I love these stocks and I see a BRIGHT  future ahead. Why is that? well back to what Cuban said,   Robinhood is NOT RESTRICTING BUYING TOMORROW for gme and amc. this means, we are obligated to show Mark what we apes are capable of!! lets do this!? HOLD THE LINE  🏻 Friday is PAY CHECK DAY for some so let’s get an even bigger one📈 disclaimer; i am a fucktard and not an advisor. I love these stocks and these companies:) god bless.

The Battle of the Smartcars!
So after connecting dots and thinking a lot I see everyone's focus is heavy on Tesla for EVs, a lot of newcomers to the game: FSR, CCIV, RIDE etc... but if I recall back then when we had phones like Nokia, Blackberry, Motorola, etc... One day a company disrupted the market and shock the masses: Apple and the Iphone. It changed the way we use phones, remember those Palm Treo? I had a 680, was cool but the iphone? omg! then Google partner with HTC to bring their phones to the market, the rest we all know what happened to each company 💀, we lived the race and the battle, it was a OS battle: iOS  vs Android, who won? both, both are still alive, BB, NOK, HTC are gone, now the new battle forming is on the EV space and now is time to make "SmartCars" Tesla slipped under both Google and Apple and now they both can see the potential of the upcoming events AKA 💵,. -Apple + Hyundai +Canoo VS -Google + Ford VS -Tesla  The rest players are the ones who will pick up the crumbles. Whatever side you pick is a win, for me I'll be investing... INVESTING... Long term, 10 years, NO pump and dump, no BS   and moon dumb shit fake bull runs, this is like buying apple before the iphone and the same to the rest of the companies.  MY OPINION IS NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR MONEY   . chill and take it easy.
Waiting for loss memes 🥱
Come on guys, time to bring the old wsb back. Need more of $GME "Gaaahhh"
Robinhood Gold Account
I’m trying to get out of RH. Took all my money out and trying to downgrade from a gold account but it’s not working. I click cancel and then Literally nothing happens. Anyone else having this problem?
Is a lower or a higher volume better for day trade gains?
I got a few stocks I’m looking at and I just had the question pop into my head
BUYING MORE GME TOMORROW
Boutta make this spike once again
DISCOUNT RATE!      TO THE MOON!
NO RESTRICTIONS NOW. BUY MORE. STAY RETARDED.          INFINITE FUEL! INFINITE ENERGY!
BUY THE DIP YOU DAMN DIRTY APES
At this point it seems that we have shed the paper handed individuals. If we all continue to load up on this dip and hold like our tendies fucking depend on it we will be triumphant. The hedgies will have to cover their asses eventually and when that time comes WE WILL HIT THE MOON WITH OUR DIAMOND HANDS. Seriously though BUY THE DIP  This is not financial advice my wife's boyfriend let me use his iPad to post this
GME Short Volume Ratio 68%
Gamestop on 9 February

THIS IS THE WSB WAY

Someone please explain...
I feel like a lot of you need this.
Moonzillion!!
“Winners never quit, and quitters never win.” ―Vince Lombardi  It's moonzillion for me!!

I don’t care if people tell me I’m holding bags, I’m still holding something, I’m holding forever
GME exposed the truth
Regardless of how much money is lost in this unwarranted market because we believed GME had potential and the SEC/hedges said otherwise, I am proud of everyone holding and believing in this stock. This is a story of the market movers gagging retail investors while profiting off our loss. Its a tragic story, one I will never regret "losing" to because it exposes the capability of market movers destroying what we define as a FREE MARKET. The SEC is not regulating fairly enabling market mover's ability to bankrupt 30+ year old companies with borrowed money and manipulating market pricing in the process. Who does the SEC decide to investigate while hedgie billionaires ride off into the sunset in their yachts with retail money? Fucking retail. Who do they target and make excuses for ruining the market movers "system?" r/deepfuckingvalue. If it counts for anything, I'll lose another 80% to keep exposing this corrupt and manipulative market. Fuck the SEC and FUCK corporate hedgies. Let the rise of retail begin.
Get busy buying, get busy holding.
DIAMOND HANDS ARE UNBREAKABLE!
I still got my Gameboy color in working condition ... if held on to that this long ... I can hold onto this stock forever ...    🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
I Just bought more of that $AMC
ask yourself, is it worth it?
Ask yourself, would you rather be remembered for selling rather than holding, when you have the potential to tell the story of how you held in the most historical    infinity short squeeze    in history? having the chance to go down in history for being part of the revolution is worth the loss. that's what a lot of you paperhands don't get. it's worth  MORE THAN MONEY .  I don't even feel bad about the money i lost, because i didnt lose what i couldn't afford to lose.  and for those that don't understand. this isn't over yet. because, while they may have covered, which they most definitely did, guess what? they're suits, they're greedy, so they most  definitely,     doubled down.        MEANING THE GAMES HAVE JUST BEGUN.     And for those that did sell, and came out with a profit, congratulations, you did well. I'm not blaming you. perhaps, you even shorted (bought puts) and made even more on the way down. now if it comes out that they did in fact double down, what would you do? would you join back in again?   🤲  🤲  🤲  🤲
PSA: No One Knows What's Going To Happen
FYI this entire thing is really simple. No one knows what the fuck is going on. Anyone who does is full of shit.   Hold if you can. Hell, buy if you can. Can here means "this is my extra fun money". Don't drop anything you're not willing to lose. Chill out, wait, eat healthy & drink water, play rest of your portfolio as normal.  Some things are conspiracies. Most aren't. Stop obsessing.

BABY APES (READ): APE PRESS BUTTOONS + APE FIND u/DFV YOUTOOB CHAN (ROARING KITTY) = SMARTER APE
So I came across this subreddit early January and have been watching closely as the GME show unfolds. I think GME was around $  a share when I seriously began considering jumping into the game... Unfortunately?/Fortunately? I decided I was a baby Ape and that I should watch as the bigger Apes take the fight to the man... Holy Fuck has it been a ride so far... Several times have both kicked myself in the ass for not getting in and thanked myself for procrastinating....  One thing my smooth-dumb-ass-ape Brain did not think about was whom is king of the jungle? u/DeepFuckingValue, aka, Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty on the utoobs.....   After reading post after post after post after spam after post, I finally came across his name, Mr. Keith Gill.  (Ape earns first wrinkle...)  After getting Jungle boss name, Ape types King’s name into the gooooogle mashine.... Ape find toob channel ( Roaring Kitty). (Ape scratches wrinkle....)  Ape press clicky pictures and hears jungle king explain wordy things about tendies....   Ape now have 2 wrinkles...  All Joking aside, I am certain I belong here as it took me this long to do this. I would like to encourage all the 5Mn new subscribers to this subreddit to do the same, or well, do any research (ape told this called Due Diligence), before they totally blow their   hoping they can jump on the back of smarter apes...   I know a lot of you are bloody, but you fights the good fight... This Ape just joined your ranks... (93s @ $  Glad to finally have a bit of skin in the game and looking forward to my 3rd wrinkle....
DOWN     Buying back into GME after broker swap. INB4 GME $40 then going vertical
Thought so
Arrest the crooks at Robinhood, and all the other trading platforms who banned the buying of GME as it was taking off... last week
Am I the only person who thinks that the SEC Should be rounding up the people at Robinhood and all the other trading platforms who refused to allow us to buy GME as it was rocketing, AND CONTINUED to limit the number of stocks we could buy in numerous other securities over nearly a week should be carted off to JAIL?  Go to Jail. Go Directly.... To Jail!...  Do not pass Go.  Do NOT Collect $200.  With NO get out of jail free cards!  I'm completely FED UP with this bullsh\ \
They can only scr#w us if we let them.
Still holding?  Buy.  Still buying?  Buy more.  The big screw was them killing buying for one day.  That caused GME and AMC to drop.  They'll take their fines, etc.  So what?  They killed the hype.  People got scared and papered out.  That killed momentum.  They figure that's all they need.  They think we'll never recover.  BUT...     WHAT IF WE JUST KEEP BUYING AND HOLDING?  Some paper hands sold and helped the cover some of the shorts... but there's still shorts and there's still enough real stock in the hands of the real owners that short sellers with imaginary stocks will still have to bid the price up.  Hold and buy.  We can still win.  If we panic and fold, initial investors will get out well and late-comers will be left without lifeboats.     Can we recover GME to $150?  Those who bought in at $300, but then bought the dip at $75 might saw off their losses if we get to $200.  Full disclosure -- I HAVE NO GME.   I bought AMC in the late version of this.  I just want to see the GME crowd who made this so big not lose out.  I want the people who YOLO'd hard to survive.  Am I crazy here?
Keep calm and load up on GME
Seriously though apes if we just keep buying the fucking dips and holding when the hedgies decide to cover we'll hold a fat portion of the shares. It ain't over yet!       This is not financial advice I eat crayons with the wrapper on
THE FIRST AMENDMENT WILL BE ON DFVALUE side

Pulling my equity line and going all in. Can't margin call my equity fuckers.
Nice
Don’t you wanna go to the moon???
Holding GME. Quit selling. We can do this if we buy and hold together. When this stock rebounds, and it will, you’ll wish you bought all you could at the price it is now. Drive the price up ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️. NOW is the time to buy and hold. This is the way.
Flood this sub with their rights
I'm just reposting cuz I'm retarded. Use, ape brain to read.  For some reason, my post got taken down so I'm gonna repost it again. The phone number's message box is full so the best way to reach out, for now, is through email. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.  To all the autist still want to go to the moon, I have the ticket right here:  1-800-273-8255  This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.  EDIT:  They also have an email in case you can't call [   If you want more information    I HOPE I DONT HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT BE KIND IN YOUR MESSAGES AND EMAILS!!!  here's a good read by someone smarter than me    Template written by u/AVeryRealHumanity   Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud  Hello,  My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.  Thank you for your time,  Power to the players,
Yay or nay?
I need this merger bad. This is my entire portfolio rn. $CCIV 💸💸💸💸💸
Nothing special, just some nice banter between people. I love this sub and all the changes. It is great!
Still Buying GME
Whether you're   or 📄  I think all of WSB can take comfort in one thing
That Robinhood is fucking done after this. That IPO is going to be hilarious. I don't care how many Super Bowl ads and cash back promos they do, their reputation is garbage. Even if GME never breaks $60 again, I'm happy knowing Melvin and RH got fucked too.  I personally am in at around $250, but it's all house money, so it doesn't me hurt to lose it. I am honestly still very optimistic that another freak squeeze is coming, but I realize that I may just be delusional.  My deepest condolences to all here who played with money that you couldn't afford to lose. I'm holding for you, brother.
Lexus Hands: HODLING AMC until my wrecked LS400 gives up. SPOILER: IT WONT, I WONT
Keep holding and buying!!! Let me raise the morale for u retards!
So i work at a place with walls on a street, i read some papers and let me tell u this with a big fat smile. THEY ARE FUUUUUKKEED! BUT ONLY IF U KEEP HOLDING AND BUYING!  They are desperate my fellow diamond hands    But hey i dont even know how to read, im just a retard that likes the stock EVEN MORE now! This is not financial advice and im dumb.  Oh and  no buy limit on RH?? Its time to shine bois!
Does anyone believe the "Reddit Revolt" with GME was orchestrated by someone with less-than-honorable intentions? (Perhaps someone needed a bunch of people to buy in and hold so that person could corner GME just long enough to profit on shares bought at a near Zero price). Were we tricked?
No, I'm not a bot.   it's a legitimate question.   Could the collective WSB community on Reddit have been tricked so that someone could run up the shares of GME, just so he/she could profit?   And the "HOLD the line" thing is just so that the shares stay high enough to short once again?    You need a certain number of people to pull this off.  I can see doing it to cause a short squeeze, but telling everyone to hold as it's dropped 75%+ is raising alarm bells in my head.   Perhaps someone with a good working knowledge of stock trading is counting on leading a group of less-than-sophisiticated investors who know just enough to get themselves in trouble.   Thoughts?
Lame or smart? “Popeyes Jumps On the Stock Market Frenzy With Free "Tendies" for All”
Just had a thought and I hope I'm wrong.
If it so happens that something very dirty got dug up with all the GME stuff, I wouldn't be surprised if something big/tragic happens.  We've already clearly seen the MSM manipulation.  I don't think it would be all that crazy for a false-flag operation to happen to draw attention away in order to get this all swept under the rug.  Yeah, I know I'm talking tinfoil hat right now, but I don't put it past the dirtbags pulling the strings.
Do you really believe there was a coup???
Sheesh. Nutty.
A message to the infiltrators
You really think we're too stupid to recognize shill posts. What you don't understand is that we're autistic, not stupid, and it has never been about the price of GME.   It's about the amount of shares we can hold and with your blatant market manipulation you just gave me discount shares allowing me to triple the amount I hold LMAO.   Every day I wake up hoping GME drops in value so I can buy more. This, combined with the amount of shares you greedy fucks shorted makes this a glorious investment.   You know it, we know it. We knew this would happen from the start, which is why we're here. I'm currently laughing my ass off while eating popcorn seeing you desperately trying to unfuck the situation you fucked yourselves into, knowing there's no way out.  You're counting so heavily on your belief that you're smarter than us, but I'm sure by now you'll have realized this is not the case. Both greed and arrogance contribute to your downfall, so you'll excuse me if I exhibit signs of Schadenfreude.  All I had to do was buy and hold, but your futile attempts at manipulation actually made it possible for me to invest more money. We might be autistic, but you're fucking stupid.   By trying to unfuck the situation, you're digging your grave deeper, trying to bluff yourself out of the situation. I'm sorry, but it won't work. We know how the stock market works and we know that you've infiltrated this sub.   We know all the cards you're playing and you know ours. It just so happens that our cards are better. No amount of cheating will help you win. The more you struggle, the harder you lose. So struggle away, I am here waiting.  Thanks for scaring off newcomers, that leaves more tendies for me.      Even a lion dies eventually and then the vultures come. I am the vulture. I am patient. I am holding.   🖕
This is the r/wallstreetbets subscriber count since Dec. We're now more than 4x the size that we were at the beginning, and Robinhood just lifted restrictions. If you thought this community had power before, it was nothing compared to its current potential.
Stock advice and platform to buy
The last time I have bought stocks was on this app called stash. Really only earned cents and used it more as a way to build up my savings or emergency funds. After hearing and seeing so much about gamestop, my motivation for investing came back. So what apps would be good to use to buy stocks and has anyone had good results with stash
293% short float
The worst part is that there was nothing we could have done due to after hours. This small timeframe quickly caught everyone off guard. Probably to shocked to realize until it was too late.
If ppl were excited to buy GME @ 300s n 400s, how can you not be excited to buy @ 30 or 40? I remember buying mine around 17!!
$NOK future
This isnt a pump post. Dont come on here posting "everyone buy $NOK tomorrow and pump this" because that shits getting old.   Over the next few days $NOK options should be getting much cheaper. IV is dropping and we are heading back to the same old $NOK. Thats a good thing.   After earnings last quarter I loaded up on LEAPs - $NOK has a history of having a crazy week leading to earnings and no matter what they post, dropping.  With that being said, options contracts are cheap.   My Play: Load up on LEAPS whem $NOK levels out and ride it again.  In march they will be presenting some new things coming forward. The hype should drove some movement in price.  I'm also in wirh 5700 shares rolling covered calls. This week cleared 2500 in premium on calls.   My suggestion - sell CCs, lower cost basis and take the cash from CCs and yolo them into the dank meme trade of the week.
How are the people involved in Wall Street Bets able to make sophisticated market moves?
Word of advice from someone who yolo'ed Facebook IPO and watched it crash immediately after
Fucking Hold!!  In 2012 friends and family called me a fucking idiot.  Asking me if I sold everytime I saw them.  Saying it was a Glamour stock and no one goes on Facebook anymore.   News went on and on about stock manipulation and lawsuits.    I liked the stock.  I held the stock.  The stock is now high enough to see from the window of my G5 because no more frequent flyer bitch miles for ya boi  I bought GME at 330 and BB at 20+.  Friends family calling me stupid again.  I still like the stocks!  Retail owns enough to be a problem and the clock is ticking.  HF's r full tilt on damage control and you cant gain selling low!  If you spent all your crayon money on this and sold on the way down b/c you realized you couldnt afford it then i supersize with you.   Ive been trading for years and learned a lot of expensive lessons.  The #1 lesson is to hold with all the degenerate strength you can muster or you'll be saying shit like i shouldnt have sold and hindsight is 20/20 while sitting in traffic in your 1997 dodge caravan next to your ugly spouse and filthy children.  The markets aren't like the pee filled kiddie pool ur used to swimming in.  They are an ocean and sometimes people take a shit in them.    Disclaimer   I ate lead paint chips when I was young.  If you take stock advice from anonymous people on a public website then ur a fucking idiot like me.
Feb 9 FINRA Short Interest Question
Seeing what I have seen from RH and even the no action from SEC for the little guys can't they just lie or make shit up like they have been doing since Thursday?  More a curiosity question. I do have stocks and I am holding.
DID YALL FORGET THE MISSION?
I HOLD $GME AND $AMC BECAUSE I GENUINELY LIKE THESE COMPANIES. I JOINED FOR THE MEMES AND GAINS AND STAYED FOR THE LOSS PORN. I HAVE NEVER FELT CLOSER AS A COUNTRY, AS A WORLD, AND AS A SUBREDDIT.  THIS IS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT FOR ME NOW, LIKE ANY OTHER STOCK I PURCHASE. AND NOW, I AM WILLING TO HOLD UNTIL I DIE.  (but please make sure you are ok financial and mentally if you are holding.)  TO THE MOON.
$CAKE Hype Thread
WSB has been overwhelmed with people trying to pull off pump and dump schemes. This time the bots will do the pumping, and we make money on the way down. The beauty with this is you don't need to put any money on the line, just be ready at the trigger.  Bots can be easily tricked. They scrape WSB for the number of mentions any (buy Cheesecake Factory $CAKE) gets, and if (buy Cheesecake Factory $CAKE) gets enough traction the bots fall for (buy Cheesecake Factory $CAKE). We have the collective power to make $CAKE by tricking the bots into buying it.
WSB causes stomach upsets?
I watched this sink all day all night from 17k to this. If the short selling manipulation happens today then this will hit stop loss. (this is a CFD trade so there has to be a SL set and cannot go higher than that). YET HOLDING WITH DIAMON HANDS
FULL STEAM AHEAD! 🚂 💨
The entire establishment order has EVERYTHING to lose if we can stand together and prevail.
Now is the time to draw our line in the sand. No one sells another share. Let the price continue to fall, we will continue to buy. What happens then? What the hell else do any of us have to lose? A few more measly dollars? HA! Like I could give any less of a fuck anymore. Their rigging has become too obvious. People all over the world are rising up and taking notice. We will never go back to the old ways. Shit, maybe when it goes low enough everyone who cashed out at the top will come back for us and we’ll go for another moonshot. What say you apes?  If you doubt the truth of my words simply take notice of all the effort to destabilize us, to defeat us not only mentally but emotionally. Yet here we are. Determined more than ever, even after some have taken devastating loses, to display the illegalities for the whole world to see. Our cause is just and we will prevail.   - This is not investment advice. This is a call to my ape brethren to change the world for the betterment of all who share the jungle with us. Today the GameStops for the criminals and the crooks.  I buy because I like the stock.
Got AMC calls right before the 300% day, and doubled down with $14 calls that expire today
Does this count as a chart? I made that and it's arriving saturday
SSR LIST FOR TOMORROW! BOTH GME AND AMC ARE LISTED TO START TOMORROW UNTIL THE 8TH. LETS HOPE WE GET THE SUPPORT TOMORROW DIAMOND HANDS!
Easy come, easy go. Holdin’ my bags, dudes.
HOLD THE LINE        DONT LET THEM TRICK YOU              THAT’S WHAT SHORT LADDER ATTACK LOOKS LIKE              TO THE MOON BABY

Brokers/apps that trade pre-market 4 am EST other than Webull and Zackstrade?
Hey guys just wanted to know exactly which brokers allow premarket hours (4 am EST - 9:30 EST) other than Webull and Zackstrade!
AAPL + hyundai, GOOG + F, MSFT + GM.. Autonomous vehicles bets
So who do you think has the best chance at getting the Autonomous cars first?.. its basically like when cars went from Manual to Automatic.  my money is on GOOGLE car 🚗 with all my money in year long F calls. Google is the top company in AI research and its tensorflow image recognition is learning more every day.  MSFT will flop like they did with the windows phone and the tiktok merger plan.. MSFT has a long list of being late to the party like with Zune.. i might buy their Microsoft car though cause they always dot their T's and cross their I's.  Your Thoughts.. please share!

Explain to this Autist why the hedge funds aren't fucking us raw?
So explain to me like I'm dumb (because I am) why we don't think the hedge funds are (metephorically) fisting us raw. Why exactly is GME going to jump up? It seems like the going theory is that the Hedgey Boys are going to have to cover their positions and it's going to bump the market, but I also think I see that the main reason is that they are going to have to cover at a high if not higher price than they initially shorted for. But will they? It seems like they already did the market fuckery while we were all holding our dicks in bed so that they can cover at a reasonable price. And we already know they did the Short 2 Electric Boogaloo right around when Robin hood was corporate shilling, while prices were high. So wouldnt it be true that although they lost money hand over fist in the beginning, they are covering the stocks sold when it was 300 beans, now during a time when its just 90 bone?  Listen I'm dumb as rocks, but how are they not fucking us up the ass right now? The way I see it they will just short this stock all the way to the floor and the only one that loses is all of us idiots who bought a meme stock at the absolute peak.  There is a lot going around that there must be a plot to undercut the market because if not why are they pulling such underhand fuckery with the false Silver story and the online boxing us out of the trading floor. We think that they are afraid of us holding, but what if we don't matter any more to them than the hundred dollar bills they wipe with. What if there isn't any plot to make us sell because they NEED us to sell, what if they would just LIKE us to sell so they get the hookers and blow earlier than next week.   I honestly want someone to explain why this isn't a rigged game. I feel a little like a guy stealing the fresh fruit from the porno set. Like obviously they noticed and I got something they want, but they are still getting paid to go balls deep in Sasha Grey so it seems like big picture not the point.   Genuinely want to know.
Well. I thought I’d share my loss porn since everyone else is as well. Still holding baby   🏻
My retarded prediction on what happens tomorrow with $GME$
Alright so at the opener it's going to dip hard, probably to about $40-39. After that giant hoards of normies start buying stocks and it begins to rocket to $60-70 by the first hour.   After that, Elon Musk decides to drop a significant investment and apes out with us, leading to him posting about it on twitter and the stock surging even higher. This causes many other high profile people follow in his footsteps and fight with us. By the 3rd hour the news is out and the stock blows up to $130-150. We will see how tomorrow turns out, but this is what I think is going to happen. Hope you enjoyed my retarded prediction, this is in no shape or form stock advice.
What’s going to be done to purge this sub of all the GME bullshit?
I’ve loved WSB for a long time now, was in on the GME play from early December, rode the wave and cashed out at around $300.   Now this whole sub is filled to the brim with people tryna justify their losses and spreading what is essentially misinformation, praying that their fellow fools will hold on and dump more money in so that they can get out with at least a slice of their initial capital.  The reason WSB got famous is because the DD posted here was often of an insanely high quality and because the shitposting was of a monumentally high level. Now this has turned to shit, and needs to be purged.  I call for a ban on all GME short squeeze related posts.
There are literally bots commenting every minute of every hour. 60 comments an hour, telling people to sell or how stupid they are.
Just caught a few of them lmfao lmfao   Either there people that literally have no life spending every minute of there day for the past 24hours commenting on every new post  or just a bot. I’m gonna assume a bot.  Edit: a vid of a account that I assume is a bot or being paid off
I’m so happy! Still we are holding together!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We can do it!!!!!!   🤲 🤲
If you didn't sell it, you didn't lose your money!  Fuck paper rubber hands!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They just mocking us but I still want to believe the people and hope!!!!!  🤲 🤲
Game show idea. Would you get COVID-19 AGAIN for $1,000 so you could trade more?
You need to have had it once already. GO!
I'm losing daily hoping for a rebound in NOK and BB....keeping my hands diamond !!!!
Please Gamble Responsibly
If you want to buy/hold, and you can afford to buy/hold, but you are starting to get worried, here are some links that might give you some hope. Nobody really knows for sure if the squeeze has been squoze, only time will tell.                 This is not financial advice, just information
GME
Hedgefunds are like sharks. They shorted the company 140 percent because they want to bankrupt it so they dont have to buy the shares back after it goes out of business. The fundimentals of gamestop have not changed and there would be no reason to double down. Go back and look at the volkswagon squeeze. It didnt happen in 2 days like that spike that happened last week. It actually did the same exact thing and then sunk to low lows and then you need a catalyst like someone buying a ton of shares. There needs to be momentum right now of a lot of retail buying forcing the price up to make the shorts suffer. This is why hf have been so scared and trying to scare people off driving the price down. There has not been a lot of volume so the reason the stock is going down is because they are shorting it heavily thus bringing the price down. Do you actually think they would spend so much money or have spies enter this reddit or try to get you to sell or spend a fortune in ladder attacks or try to get you to buy silver then tank it the next day or limit your buying power? They are trying to make you doubt yourselves and sell. The volkswagon spike happened over months. Infact it hit prices if 450 and 500 before going back down. This was before the squeeze happened. I urge you to pull up the stock prices daily for that whole year and see for yourself. We are literally in the middle of the squeeze. We need a lot more volume to cause an upwards momentum.
Question about transferring funds from RH to Fidelity
I'm not using robin hood anymore, but I've got a few bucks on it. I see that I can link my fidelity account to robin hood to transfer, but I only have a brokerage account on fidelity. Is that where the funds would go, or do I need to open an actual bank account with them?
GME Gameplan?
I have been reading up on people using Mark Cuban’s words of basically testing the true power of WSB after the restrictions of certain stocks are released. The restrictions are now released. Apparently the mods are back in control. I will be buying the dips and continue holding. People also speculate the hedgies double downed on the shorts of GME stock, but we wont have a true answer until Feb. 9th. So what are you guys thinking?
Buy GME and AMC lets gooooo
Well, I’d rather see red than liquidate for barely anything. Shine bright like a diamond.
Q: How do you catch a monkey?
A: You put bait (sweet tendies) in a jar (RH IPO short).  Then when they refuse to let go (  🧤 to the moon!) you walk up and whack them.  Shorting: finite potential gain, infinite potential loss.
Robinhood: Stop leaving, we'll give a 5% deposit match up to $150, pls
Honest questions: while I believe the point was well made and needed to happen, is this only a GME space now? We do have companies like NIO with a bright future with a few big shorts in the way. Will people like me just get harassed for posting about anything other than gme?
Should I buy GME
Let me know if you think I should still buy GameStop
GME and AMC holders please read
Is it worth noting that if you search the SSR list for tomorrow, GME and AMC are both listed to activate tomorrow until the 8th of February. With Robinhood also getting rid of restrictions, this could mean a huge day tomorrow . But what do I know, I’m just another   who bought in at $300!!
Robinhood lifts trading restrictions
Here we go
LETS HOLD GUYS DIAMOND HANDS
guys borrow against your house, take out loans, DO  whatever you NEED TO DO to get MONEY IN. you will be living like billionaires :D  it's impossible to lose money on this, just buy and HOLD.
ZRX is the next buy! Buy in now!
The gains are off the chart. Not to mention great potential platform
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em
Alright $GME bagholder gang, let's get to the real shit in how to turn this ship around:  I know some of you weirdos out there certainly believe in this shit, but we're going to get our tin-foil hats on here.  Drastic times call for drastic measures.  We'll need a few things:  - Candles - 3 Chickens - Natenberg's Option Volatility & Pricing - Powerball/Mega Millions tickets (optional)  We're going to talk about chicken sacrifices to the market gawds in dedication to Papa Jerome Powell (peace be upon him) and hope some of this QE flows your way.  I read once in a great investing book, this is what the glowies at rival hedge funds do to generate phaat (yes with ph) gainz.   First, we need a copy of our options trading bible, yes natenberg - ah you've never heard of it? that's why you might find yourself in this position old sport!  Second, we need some candles for ambience. Can't make money if your vibe isn't right. Ok.   Third, now this isn't where its very clear - but this is my takeaway - I've read that for every 2 chickens, you can exchange your newly minted paper bag for 25% refund. With a 3rd, we unlock a tier which has only been seen by a few.  Fourth we have to chant "GME AMC APE TOGETHER DUMB, SPCE AMD BETTER TRADES, x100.  Then from there it just works. Maybe even pick up some Powerball & Mega Millions tickets as an insurance policy  Rumor is, even after you get rich, it also makes your pp super big  So gang, what else do you have to lose?
AMC APES UNITE GME SPEDS UNITE! Big pressure make bigger Diamond Hands    🦧
side note: how's your mental health? i hope ur eyes are on the potassium these stonks are finna go bananas. we just gotta ride the edge longer than hedgies, im sure us apes will have no problems doing so. don't let them scare you aware, just do what you're comfy with💚       or 💀 second side note: i am not a financial advisor
The moon... after GME hits!
AMC 2/19 Buy/Sell Pressure by Strike
Trying to provide some insight into the AMC price action leading into 2/19     The important point in the chart is the $11 strike has the majority of the selling pressure (the negative bar) which will require a lot of momentum (buying into and above that strike) to overcome. It is no coincidence that this is the area of the gap down 2/1-2/2.  Edit: dates
THE SHORT FLOAT IS   LETS GO
New Day, Same Chart. Credits: u/Jan_237
A good reflection of my losses with $GME now and my other stock ($IDEX) that i held for months!! I went from buying IDEX at   and witnessing it go down to .86 at one point and up currently to  ! But I've been holding since May 2020 and averaging down. I know I can do the same with GME
Short float % is   Check the tooltip, check the comparison data. This is not the same as the FINRA   data.

WHO IS STILL HOLDING?
[2 Slides] - Here's my  amateur  loss porn, you fucking degenerates. Delete this shit if it's not in the $10k range, I spent all my GBP on tendies..
What’s your exit strategy when $GME goes to the moon?
In defense of the Robinhood app
Hold your fire! I make no claims on the company's morally dubious practices, however I think in interest of informing new comers, it behooves us to distinguish between the app and the company. For all intents and purposes, they have a good product. The app is, from my experience, astoundingly simple for newcomers. To my admittedly inexperienced eyes, it seems to be an alright application to use alongside your other apps just to learn more about stonks.  Anyway, keep up the good fight. All polite discourse is appreciated.
Quote for those still holding GME
Now that everything is over, here is a quote from Ryan Cohen:  “Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,” - Ryan Cohen (   RIGHT NOW THE HERD ARE THE SHORTS, and KING COHEN WILL SILENCE THE NAY SAYERS. KING Cohen knows that "GameStop is also one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market" (   We are just getting started and I ain't hear no bell yet. Hold the line with DIAMOND HANDS. If KING Cohen is in I'm still in, If DFV is in, I'm still in. HOLD and BTFD.   This current market situation is so similar to TSLA back in the days with all the bears and all (ie: BAML thinking this is worth  $, and we got shorts thinking this stock is the next blockbuster and going to 0$ since it will never turn around from a brick & mortar store). Well, If that is the case, then why do you think Cohen invested in the company and loaded up on more shares after it became $15 ? This is because it ain’t over and WE ARE GOING TO THE MOON    so be patient my fellow apes.    this is not financial advice and I am NOT comparing GameStop to TESLA, I’m just saying the market conditions are similar. But I’m just a retarded ape that has never had such confidence in someone since Papa Elon. But as they say, you invest in the visionaries and the leaders, and I think Cohen is one of ‘em, so I’m ready to go ALL IN on KING COHEN
GME - Island top reversal - Yea I know you don’t want to hear this but GME probably isn’t going back to 300. If you want to be beat Wall Street then learn to trade properly, build your wealth, and use it to change your life. This is the way. Going down with the ship is not.
this entire sub for a week: don’t take us seriously
y’all for some reason: took them seriously now getting mad at them
RALLY ON $GME
If we stay on the stonk squeeze we can screw the hedgies AND get rich.. they will have to buy all outstanding shares to recoup their loss.. the deadline is the 17th... don't get soft and play into the hands of the hedgers... they are on the ropes.. together.. in sheer numbers.. one crayon eater at a time we will rally together and crush these asshats.. HOLD THE LINE!!!! $GME
Check out this ladder attack on the 28th!
Robinhood Lifts Buy Restrictions on GameStop, AMC As Stocks Tank
GUH
Now that loss porn is finally back  When is GUH gonna make it's grand return?
Hold your tendies and buckle up, $GME$ is going to rocket tomorrow and here's why
Everyone has been watching this stock. From young to old, even my own grandmother has been thinking of buying. So many people WANT to get in, but have just been waiting for an affordable price. Now that news has gone around that it hit $50 there's going to be a huge influx of normies buying $GME$ tomorrow. That coupled with the suspicion that Elon Musk is buying in, plus Robinhood & other places lifting restrictions. This could be a huge day for us, and sooner than later the HF's will have to pay out those shorts. I've doubled down and am telling you retarded apes JUST HOLD!! Our time is coming, the universe has aligned itself for our power. Together we are strong, apes.
Dave Portnoy Buys Back Into AMC, Thinks There's a Second Wind
Robinhood removes all limits on GEM and AMC!
I KNOW IT SUCKS BUT HOLD GME A LITTLE LONGER AND ITLL BE WORTH IT YOU CRAZY BASTARDS
Should we start a GoFundMe to pay for a  🙏🏻 Super Bowl advertisement?
Please, Please ban use of the words autist, autistic and autism on here. It's not funny, it's highly offensive and disrespectful.
I  am autistic, and I am really sick and tired of seeing the word being  misused and tossed around here as a joke. I'm finally speaking up. This  needs to stop. You are t  on the true meaning of being Autistic.  This is incredibly offensive. Do people here not know that there are  just as many people who are autistic who possess above average and  genius levels of intelligence as there are people with cognitive  deficits? Autistic people want no association with this degenerate  casino.  The word autistic is not synonymous with gambling or making poor financial decisions. You guys aren't autistic, you're just plain fucking stupid.  Sure  you might have one upped big money on this one GME play but in the end  all I see are bagholders everywhere who are proud of buying a $5 stock  for $300. Do you think they will let this reddit pump and dump strategy  continue to win? your unemployment checks are no match for the big boys,  and you're out of your fucking minds if you think institutions won't  have the last laugh. Like does anyone here know what being "autistic"  actually means? I'm not going to waste my time educating you. But I want  to say this. Stop.  Out of all the  companies out there, you   Gamestop. GAMESTOP. A company sure to  die out. The stock was cheap for a fucking reason, because the company  can't compete and will end up bankrupt.  You  guys are too dumb to see that you can't just randomly pick a cheap  stock out of a hat and expect to turn the company into a multi trillion  dollar behemoth because you bought OTM calls.  Delusions  of grandeur on here. Bet most of you will end up losing your GME  "tendies" by buying some OTM calls during earnings, at the top of a 10  year bull market. Then come here crying. Because WSB can't fail right?  give me a fucking break.  All this tossing around of the word autistic is defamation. And if it doesn't end. I will go to the admins.
Down over $10k on my initial investment and still holding    (but don’t really have a choice lol)
When are they gonna restrict selling and only allow buying?
Why should there be ladder attacks when the squeeze already happened and its all over?
Where are we going next? This sub is run by elitist. Please and thank you!!
Hot sub without douche mods?
Keep your spirits up imagine the financial freedom
like which Lambo are you guys buying once GME goes to the moon?
A global movement?
After reading through a couple of posts here... I noticed not a lot of people brought up the fact that WSB has a worldwide following. We don’t all function at the exact same trading/work hours, combined with the delay of robinhood, this timing seems... right.   Bananas in the near future? Regardless, I’ll fall asleep laugh/crying tonight... together ?
First post, first WSB buy, this is appropriate
Me holding onto $GME while the rest of you paper-handed pussies are selling your gainz
Who's still holding?
I am holding all the way to the moon just for the hell of it. And yes I'm aware not to bet all your life savings and what not, I'm using my extra dollars of course. BUT TOGETHER STRONG NOTHING CAN STOP OUR RETARDED ASSES. 💵💸💸💸💰💲
The Drop in GameStop Short Interest Could be Real — Or Deceptive Market Manipulation

If some autists can hold while 6 figures down, I can too.
After seeing autists with 6 figures down, I feel slightly less retarded.  Threw in all my Tesla gains to YOLO and I'm sticking with the cause.  I'm holding and buying the fuckin' dip.
YOLO trade strategy for Investors who kept getting FCKed this week.
As a financial analyst with 2 weeks in Wall Street Bets. I believe that I can share this view with you since I have the same experience as any Harvard or Yale grad has when they join a wall street hedge fund.   Instead the media and hedge funds taking WSB investors for dead. It would be a good strategy to make a very public statement that WSB is here to stay. The top two stocks that the media connects WSB with is GME and AMC. While it would be awesome it where GME, its just too expensive.   Any investor who has the ability and wants to believe that WSB can be a hedge fund for the masses the best way to do so is by converting GME stock to AMC. Right now roughly 1 GME = 5 AMC stocks. Anybody who would follow this strategy that owns GME would increase their leverage 5X against the AMC shorts. This strategy is not just about those that own GME if there are autists who don't own GME they would still benefit buying the stock as it is cheaper than pre pandemic levels. The timing of this strategy is good. This is at the end of the week which means that whoever is managing their shorts are going to rebalance for the next week. (research pending) This is a perfect time to force the short squeeze.   Full Disclosure: own 1000 AMC stock at $  this is not financial advice  retard speak:  Turn those diamond hands into diamond FISTS and shove it up the shorts' ass!!   AMC to the moon!!!  Edit: With more comments than likes, I feel this more a discussion than a YOLO trade at the moment.  Edit1: Changed back flair (ADHD kicked in)
Robinhood's latest attempt at keeping customers they once manipulated...
WSB was the place for the GME exploration to happen
The hedge funds are trying everything in their disposal to weaken the buy and hold mentality of the apes in here. The only difference is as bane said," you merely adapted to the darkness, I was born in it, molded by it". What happened last night was clearly manipulation, and it didn't take even a day for the community get it's page back. Everyone here knew something was wrong, even when they saw the posts, the comments  etc. Most of the moderators started to comeback. All it need is to kick the back stabbers outta here.   There are still manipulation going on, buts bit subtle and people are more aware than ever now.   Hold! That's all I can say
Y'all do realize that buying is what makes prices go up, not holding, right?
There has to be demand. If everyone who wanted in got in, and then they all just held... Then suddenly those people aren't affecting prices any more. Even if the entire "screw the hedge funds" crew held and had 50% of all the available stocks, you've just succeeded in turning a $12 stock into a $24 stock, not a $1000 stock. The spike happened because of all the new people trying to get in at the same time created demand. Once you're in, if you already dumped all your money into it, then holding and refusing to sell doesn't actually help you or hurt anyone else.
I had potential life-changing gains in front of me last week, but refused to sell because my diamond hands like the stock  🏾
I must be the biggest retard here.
BUY AND HOLD CAUSE ROBINHOOD LIFTED ALL RESTRICTIONS WE GOT THIS!!!
Trying to YOLO here but Regions is trying   me. If any of you have Regions Bank are you successfully able to transfer cash into RobinHood, Webull, Cash app or BinanceUS?
Was working fine earlier today.  Now every transactions n fails.  I tried relinking the account and now get the message that "Regions has made changes that   allow me to link my account" or some such garbage.

Remember hedge funds were shorting GME at a much lower price.
You can still join in and do some damage. They canceled my stonk when I first tried to buy in. Now I’m paying to get some payback. I’ll be buying a few shares today to do my part and I’ll ride it to ZERO! YOLO!!! (Just dont tell my wife...)  Edit: This post is not intended to be financial advice!  🤲
Digging in deeper virtually cause I have no more money
When do the short numbers get announced/released?
GME to 20?
Curious if anyone is buying puts?
I’m having a baby!
Today is my wife’s due date and she started having contractions this morning. If GameStop somehow hits 1000 today, I will legally name this boy “Deep Fucking Value!”      7 GME 374 100 AMC
KEEP HOLDING GME TO THE MOON
This is about a VIDEO GAME store
you retards heard me correctly, this is about a VIDEO GAME store. I am in my mid 30's and I fucking annihilate those shitbag 12 year olds on FIFA. Video games are not going away but changes are needed for the stores. GameStop has nostalgia and  It has high hopes for future. Fuck the squeeze. Who cares at that point, hedge funds fight dirty and have all the ammo at their side. Let's realize why we are investing in this company (get rich,   if you missed that then opportunity) this is the real fucking deal. Take a moment to realize they are securing an Amazon exec. ummmm, I could employee your tard cousin but it won't make me money. You think these guys are thinking let's use the same model from 20 years ago.....definitely wrong. These fucking avengers know what works and are going to absolutely turn this business into an EMPIRE. The point I am trying to drive home is that this stock is worth   not 300 today but with innovation and development and time will give you your tendies.  yadadadada not finacial advice, invest as an individual in what you think is right.
A quick reminder of Mark Cubans thoughts on the situation
REMEMBER THIS   “So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.“  ✨ 📈 ✨🌖✨🛰✨ ✨🪐 ☄️
Loss Porn. But it ain't a loss if you sell. Holding for greener pasture.
I sold my Tesla shares for these GME. I'll hold till they buy me a Tesla.
Honestly if you aren’t diamond handing GME , you might aswell dress up in a suit and move to Wall Street
Fellow retards currently putting cream on your raw ass I have data and info that has been unable to get through with the massive influx and lack of karma to post.
This is not financial advice I’m a fucking dumb ass that likes casino coke ACOLA and literally anything else that involves pissing money into the wind       Hello everyone I’m sort of new to WSB sub I’m not an OG of the sub but I’m an OG of Reddit & I used to watch the WSB sub from afar as it wasn’t something I felt like I wanted to dive into so I didn’t actively follow this sub until recently.   My post in the WSB today gathered lots of attention to my surprise   28k it shows me liked my post and with that came a flood of messages from our fellow tards one who wants to stay unknown and one who wasnt permitted to post on WSB yet.    The first message is as follows   I have a point that needs to be heard. But can't post as i'm new here.  I work in finance sector. I am a PI on etoro, don't tell anyone as I want to remain anonymous.  People are losing hope. But the squeeze is nearly here. Holding the line is not enough & may not activate the squeeze.  Looking at the data, the price dropping do to supply and demand issues. People are not buying enough. This means price drops = fear, more people sell.  120% are still short with more contracts set to expire on Friday. If the price increase to $150-200 I belie the squeeze would be hit as the new contracts would cause this.  As it stands, the margins are not being called and they appear to be winning. ALL YOU NEED IS TO HOLD & PUSH ONCE MORE FOR THE SHORT SQUEEZE.  This is just my personal view. But maybe it should be heard.   Second message is from   r/ tag2105   Hey,  I‘m a german student whos also in $GME. But the Channel WSB is confusing me..  The new data published by Finra two days ago shows, the short interest is damn High! 226%   Here is the Link    I tried to Post it in wsb and ask how this can be possible and If it’s True, how can there still be Dozen of Users telling other „it’s over“ etc. But i have not enough Karma to post it there, so i‘ve seen your post and would like to ask you if you could post it instead.  Sorry for my bad english, Ape Brain
Can anybody explain how $AMC ripped like it did with basically no green volume indicators when it took off?
A Battle for Control of WallStreetBets May Have Broken Out
Been short selling $GME and $AMC for a few days now. Thanks you guys for pumping the crap out of this and setting it up nicely for us.
Psychological warfare
Well all these attacks are only making these diamond hands stronger!
No matter what happens...
I just appreciate you guys helping me get into stocks, I’d never thought I’d ever really be able to figure this stuff out but, this whole crazy fiasco got me into this group and it’s been a big adventure and learning curve even if I am losing money, I feel like I found myself a new hobby for years to come and have no idea how I hadn’t got into it   that will help me lose   gain lots of money(hopefully) and I couldn’t be happier hehe  Anyway, love yuh goodnight. 😘
A lot of grave dancing on this sub recently. Important to remember a few things though
There is a lot of schadenfreude going on and talking about how idiotic people were for not selling their GME at $300+   But it's important to remember that none of the bag holders here made a dumb decision to hold.  Not actually.  They got giga-fucked by the brokers when they restricted buying, something nobody saw coming and was basically a totally unprecedented move, and completely cratered momentum.  And it gave the hedge funds and shorters critical time to cover their most toxic positions to prevent complete destruction.  That stock really was about to     , then they pulled the rug right out from under everyone.   Everyone who bought at $300+ saw the evidence and jumped on the momentum.  They made the right choice.  The choice was so right in fact that they got a media, wall street & politicians scrambling for how to deal with it.  They got Citadel to bail out Melvin Capital, and they got the clearing houses and market makers to restrict selling.     The DD was right.  We were fucking the hedge funds and beating them at their own game.  They were caught with their pants down.    The main issue is that traders didn't know how long the buy-restriction would be in effect.  Would it be restricted 1 hour? 4 hours?  By the time they undid the restriction to an acceptable level (basically today), it was already too late.    So now the situation has turned from a get rich quick & fuck the hedge funds scheme to a more traditional long play.  With a small chance of a short term spike if something major happens.    Gamestop has all the attention it could have ever asked for.  And most of their new shareholders are likely their PRIME demographic that they would love to have back, and now have every reason in the world to help them succeed.     If Cohen plays his cards right and knows what he's doing, he can turn Gamestop into a legitimate competitor to Steam a la the Epic Games Store, as well as compete with NewEgg if they can pivot into PC hardware & culture, which is a huge market that is basically totally untapped for them right now.    There is still money to be made in GME stock.  However it will more likely take a year or two (or more) instead of a week or two.    But I don't think it's fair to call people idiots for getting in late and/or not selling.  We should be sympathizing with them for getting fucked by the system so hard with blatant corruption.  Not making fun of them.   It's not your fault if you get cheated on, even if the signs may have been there in retrospect.   Anyway, let the retards have their fun.   It's nice to have some hope in this fucked up world every once in a while.   So I'm gonna go to Gamestop first for all my gaming needs from now on, and I'm gonna hold some GME stock.  Not worth it to sell at this point anyway.
Piece of shit broker but might as well take advantage of low prices
TODAY, THE SHOW GOES ON
Stimulus Check is Looming
To all my fellow American apes. We had your back when you needed to pump those rookie numbers.  Let your inner retard go out. You know that check already has a name and it’s fucking GME.  Hedge funds got bailed out with tax money to fuck the economy once again. What about you use your well contributed tax money and fuck them up.  This is not financial advice. I am just another retard.  Bananas are on the horizon! We just need to double down and take them tendies!
New emoji? 🌊🌊 how about the wave?
If there’s anything I feel like right now, it’s that I’m riding the wave.  I love the emojis we have now but let’s keep that COURAGE and CREATIVITY flowing.  How about a wave — a second wave? Well, now that trading restrictions are lifted on BANG stock by brokerages, and it’s on sale it feels like the sky is the limit.  And it’s Friday. The energy is on our side.  Who’s feeling the wave?? 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
Someone please make the pain go away☹️
First time better, long time lurker! Turning that covid stimy into straight rocket fuel!!
Sold out of all my positions today and it is ON tomorrow. Picking up 1,000 shares at open in the morning. Refueling this   just took longer than expected. (Fuk robinhood but don’t want to wait for funds to switch to my fidelity)
Still holding strong!
so what’s up with GME and AMC?
It seems everyone has given up on these stocks. People saying it’s over, and they are holding for the memes. I’ll still hold my AMC, always the chance it recovers after covid, but with GME, is it just over? Has the squeeze squoze? I bet a lot of people are really let down right now, you can only expect so much from a group of 8 million autists. If you’re new, you chose the wrong place to start i̶n̶v̶e̶s̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ gambling. Take a break from the markets, learn about how to correctly invest, read some books, watch some videos, watch your wife’s boyfriend fuck her, stop listening to the apes on this sub if you have no clue what you’re doing. that is all.

It ain’t much and it isn’t a loss till you sell. NOT SELLING
I think it’s going to go down more today , if I could guess maybe 30, any other guesses on what’s going to happen  💫😀
Where is the loss porn?
Seriously GME and amc have gone down 80% in the last week and I've seen like 2 loss porn posts. Come on people post those screenshots
This is what we are up against. Bots and these hounds. Do what you believe and stay strong, for you.

Hi,I’m in over my head. And you are? Can somebody with more brain cells than a peanut explain to   it over? Will the stock rise? Should I cut my losses and sell? Was I left holding the back or is this the HF scaring us into selling?
Why $ZNGA is a good buy
$ZNGA is pretty close to it's all-time high, deservingly so. They've set a record for revenue in September at $503 million.     There are rumors of an acquisition by Tencent. $GLUU is a competitor, but much more stagnant by comparison.     $ZNGA sits at $10-11 a share, a prime target for an actual stock with upside with no need to squeeze for it to go up. No one can claim our pricing is out of touch with the fundamentals, given their financial track record.
New Beginnings?
i am just an ape but... it looks like they have shorted the fuck out of GME on its way down, whats to stop us starting this all over again?
Any idea what’s going on with NOK? I had 600 shares for few years now

Curious
Who here has lost a significant amount of money with GME I just read the barstoolsports owner sold at 700k loss.  Who is down a crazy amount and holding like a true retard
Lost a Years worth of Investing + Savings in 2 weeks $GME  📉
The Time Has Come
The Time Has Come  Mods. It’s time. It’s time to purge this chat full of noobs who are literally still bag-holding a shitstock with no fundamental value except for the mere chance of it catapulting to the sun on short buybacks. This is not the WSB that I knew. Before all the noobs, I could come here and everyone would have different stock selections some retarded and some fundamentally sound. Every time I come here now it’s full of idiots. Yes, literally mongoloid idiots who are still bag-holding GameStop thinking that funneling another paycheck into it will take them to the sun and surpass Elon musks net worth. In addition, I bet both my testes every morning when I wakeup that I will come onto wall street bets, and there will be some idiot down an egregious amount of capital screaming “HOLD THE LINE”. This was entertaining for the first 2 weeks. Now it is literally retarded. There is no “line” being held when you move from $500 to $70 in a week span. You are just a bag-holding mongoloid who has lost more money than you were ever prepared to lose. I need the old WSB back. I need more than 2 stocks being shilled constantly or I’m going to have a sever aneurism and die. I might jump off a cliff if I see another tier 3 retard shilling AMC while he’s down 98%. Please mods save this sub. My soul cannot take it.   PS: if you are still holding AMC or GameStop you’re an absolute idiot. Cry about it. Downvoting me won’t save all the money you lost lmao. ApEz tOgeThEr StRoNg.  Ps part 2: if GameStop goes above 500$ I’ll ban myself from this sub  Edit 3: the newfags are very upset they invested capital and are now losing it. Very funny. Many triggered retards here.  Edit 4: I have come to the conclusion every angry comment is bagholding hard. Very sad!  Edit 5: lmao people raging in here like they thought GameStop was the next Tesla. I’m dead hahah.

Elon Musk
Tomorrow Elon Musk will tweet out $GME and $AMC. Get ready.
I remember why I joined
Not a long time autist but a autist for sure check my first post. I started buying GameStop at 7 dollars.  A couple months ago it wasn’t about taking down hedge funds, it wasn’t wsb vs the man, hardly anyone spoke about GameStop, it was about loss porn and tendies. I’m a simple autist, now it seems wsb is about conspiracy’s and only GameStop. What has our new found power done to us?   Like Peter Parker’s boomer uncle said “with great power come great responsibility”  Can’t wait for all the spam and conspiracy theories to go back under ground and we can go back to the simple time of position or ban.  Position: 7k stocks of DM
can’t the people in suits just manipulate the shorts % report ?
As stated in the title. If those people can manipulate the market so easily can they just manipulate the report which would be out on 9/2? i’m just a retarded   hopefully someone would be able to explain.   12 shares @111 (not much cause im a broke student )
Still in it! Planning on getting more tomorrow.

Dissapearance of DD Quality
Since the massive influx of members, this sub has been blowing up with people trying to pump coins and various 100 mil micro cap companies. To make matters worse, the quality of DD went from paragraphs of solid theories on various stocks to people just posting a sentence "  like this stock" under the DD flair trying to re-enact GME while providing no DD other than a pump and dump. I'm aware the mods have been overwhelmed recently and messing around with posting for new members.... while also creating rules regarding  karma... ugh. My karma is low since I never felt the need to dilute the quality of this subreddit. I really think the best way to combat this dilution is to start banning members that make posts irrelevant to the flair they are posting on. Its not complicated to read the subreddit rules when joining and posting.
GaymeStop & Robinhood
I kind of edited the name because of potential stupid rules, but... it seems like trade limit restrictions are lifted (FUCK ROBBINGHOOD).We can still make a positive effect here. I know a bunch of geniuses are selling, but I need my fucking retards to step up with gorilla mentality. I’ve YOLO’d in this stock and you better believe this diamond dick isn’t going limp even if it gets to the pennies. This diamond dick is so hard right now thinking about what we’ve already proved can be done.  Scared money is lost money.  You can’t have diamond hands without pressure.  The dip is financially appealing atm.  This isn’t financial advice by any means. But at the same time, don’t be an idiot.  Let’s see some diamond cocks.

Just a reminder brothers: We can afford a loss. Can they afford a 7 billion loss? 💀💀💀
REMEMBER THIS FROM MARK CUBAN YESTERDAY :
"So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.“
David Portnoy is a piss poor trader lmao

AMC BUYERS/HOLDERS READ
Ok a lot of you retards are saying “squeeze will start Friday” or “squeeze will be next Tuesday”. Shut the fuck up. There is NO time limit on short positions. Nobody knows when they’ll cover. But we know their time is running out. Everyday this drags on it’s costing funds millions to hold their short position and they are being pressured to cover. You don’t think those same funds watch what we say on here? If and when they see that people are expecting the squeeze on Friday or next Tuesday, they’re NOT going to cover. Instead they’ll wait out and watch the retail investors ask “but it’s Friday it was supposed to squeeze..”. Then those same retail investors will start to lose hope and will sell off. Once again, shut the fuck up about when it’s going to be and instead just buy and fucking hold. Don’t say a fucking word about when, especially when we have time on our side and they don’t.  TLDR: shut the fuck up about WHEN the supposed squeeze is supposed to happen because the shorts are listening. They’ll just wait for our spirits to be crushed and for the eventual sell off. Just buy hold and shut the fuck up about when the squeeze is supposed to happen. It will happen.  This is not financial advice. I’m a retarded ape who like this stock
What happens if GME stock was shown to have been actively manipulated or phantom stocks used?
Not in anyway suggesting anything here; I’m just curious what people think might happen should something come out on the 9th?  Would the SEC even do anything, putting aside the probability that a fine would be relatively small in scale?
Lololol peak is 13k all gains from the year wiped....
Unpopular opinion: Elon, Chamath, and Mark are assholes for encouraging the frenzy
These billionaires aided the pump during the pump and dump and then laid blame on the shorts when millions of people got hurt. They knew an epic price depreciation was going to happen. They knew that people were going to take their own lives over losing their second mortgage, but they didn't care.  Instead they saw this as an opportunity to put themselves in the limelight, sadly because they know that they have herds of people that will blindly follow them to the edge of a cliff. Chamath even saw this as an opportunity to shill his SoFi on Twitter, and then in complete irony a day later a short report comes out accusing another one of his SPACs (Clover Health) of Medicare fraud. Seems like a good reason to want to get shorts squeezed out of the market, doesn't it?  These guys are not your friend.
HOLD the LINE! AMC all the way!
Why my $GME loss may be my greatest investment.
I have only been following and learning about the stock market for about 8 months. I caught on to the GME movement late. If I sold now I’d lose about $600. Over the past two weeks I have learned more about the stock market than $600 could ever buy in books, classes, webinars, etc. I was lucky to only spend $600 to see first hand the volatility and now the corruption within the market, it could have been a lot more. So I move forward positively and with determination to set a plan with goals and work to perfect the plan. OH, and I’ll never sell my GME stocks, I will pass them on to future generations and tell them all about this crazy story.
PSA - Oh my god. Please NEVER and Do not kill yourself - money can be earned back again
Not a bot. Just an Autard asking how to tell when a squeeze is   still going on. Cause that price TANKED today. Haven’t bought GME yet, waiting for more trendy tendies on Friday.
You guys should use the green mode on RH. It's way more fun. ($APHA     ) 👉 For meme. 🔥
I like how most of you fucktards all of a sudden aren't the ones who still holding the bag....
't be acting like you ain't holding no bag. Fucking own up to it. These fucking monkeez have the balls to post they're still holding with diamond hands. Show some respect. They might be morons but they're diamond handed morons. #respect

Robinhood cost the WSB dearly. Now that coordination has lessened and Wall Street is all caught up on GME and AMC, Robinhood removes restrictions. This is  not  good news.

I’m new to investing, these past few weeks have definitely sparked my interest. Any recommendations on books for fundamentals or websites I could sign up for information stock info? (Even if it’s a premium site)
Thank you all!!  Sorry to be a newb!
Real Talk: When you're left holding the bag
Edit: TLDR:    💰     This community is all over the place. And for good reason. With millions joining the sub in a matter of weeks and the single greatest meme event in Wall Street history, there’s a lot of misinformation and clouded sentiment. Compounded by internal politics and manipulation.  Turn all of that off for a second and hear some real wisdom.  Here’s the DD for y’all that haven’t been around for more than a month. For credibility and backstory: I’ve been following u/DeepFuckingValue (our Lord and Savior) since July. We all knew who Roaring Kitty was on YouTube and his DD and streams were the shit! Go checkout his channel and you’ll understand where you’re actually sitting at on charts (hint: probably holding the bag currently) but don’t get discouraged yet!  Back when GME was a pitiful $4, DFV was sharing fundamentals as well as speculation that the stock was worth $50-80. That’s likely what the price will reflect long term. However, the case for a short squeeze was a bonus and really memed hard in December. That’s what probably lead a lot of you noobs to this sub.  So what does that mean for the future? Shorts are still high. 20% short interest is considered extreme. Conservative (and likely manipulated) estimates still show interest above 50%. Fuck the float hype and short squeeze. The reality is you don’t need the hype for the obviously bullish moves coming throughout 2021 on GME. Most of you retards have probably lost 70% or more, so there’s no real reason to fret or stress about losing more anyways, right?! Instead, here’s what you do:  Cost average at this current dip. Meaning buy more with whatever disposable income you’ve got. It’s going to have support based on the 50 day moving average and fundamentals. The stock should be trading at $80-100 in my opinion and based on (mostly) fundamentals. GME earnings in March are likely to make a case for positive outlook for the company to $100 and beyond through 2021. You may not see it rise to $300+ this year if you bought the top, but you may realize some conservative gains that net you some profits or at least break even. Optimistically, there’s still a really good chance the squeeze has a round 2, but don’t count on it. Make the long term play if you like the company and stock and just hold. Learn your lessons and get better at due diligence.  Do what makes sense for you, and always do your own research. Yea, we’re degenerates/retards/autists but many of us in this sub are also ridiculously smart and wear those labels ironically. We just like to have fun and make stupid bets with our tendies. That’s the whole premise here, and I don't think anyone expected the surge of idiots that just follow along blindly. This is never meant to be financial advice. Just a place to laugh, learn, and love; while eating shit or tendies depending on the day!
APES LOVES BANANAS. APES TOGETHER STRONG. THERES A REASON BANANAS ARE SHAPED LIKE A ROCKET     .    ONLY
Watching this chaos....
Last week it seemed like everyone was on the   same   side. It's fascinating watching you guys turn on one another so quickly. I understand everyone's frustration about losing money, but are you guys not understanding the point about it not being about the money and more or less sticking it to HF's and the corrupt stock market? If they can manipulate prices and want to continue to stack their tendies, why couldn't we? I feel like this attitude is due to people investing what they couldn't lose on a BET (hence, wallstreet  bets  ).  I will not tell you guys what to do because I am not a financial advisor. I can only say that we have made history and can continue to do so. In the end, it seems like if we go to 0 or $1000+ we have become divided and that's exactly what they want from us.  From one autist to another, I am holding out my hand to join forces instead of being divided.
Not much but honest work

Robinhood lifts trading restrictions on GameStop, AMC stock
Yellen vows to protect us

I didn't hear no bell...
What Will Happen if we continue buying AMC stock every day for the rest of the year?
It's affordable for the average joe to buy. We should continue this movement until 2022. Hold the line.
Where did  ’a money go?
I get that Robinhood did not pull enough money and lost the momentum presumably. Good excuse it sounds like.   Of course it happened AFTER they deplatformed little guy for a hate speech.   No invasions at all. Just a sequence of unfortunate events for      But what about that money that we have poured into $GME that gouged price to nearly $500? Where are they now? Who owns what used to be our hard-earned money now?
Boys this is it. This is the time to rebound and beat those sons of bitches. Now that we can trade we can buy and that’s how we win by buying. The more we buy the more we drive up the price and make money. We need to hold, but we need to accumulate and buy!    BUY OR FUCKING DIE

Hey everyone so I've been following what's been going on with the bad mods trying to monetize the group and with one of the original founders trying to profit off of the group via a movie deal and I am outraged! The whole point of Wall Street bets is that we all win or lose together.  I think we should file a class action lawsuit to make sure we all get a piece of the movie deal profits. Who's with me?!

Fellow Apes, HOLD TIGHT
Hold your shares. Don’t be stupid and play into the Hedge-funds hands. Talks cheap. Hold GME, show us your F U shares.
Limited buys have all been removed!
I woke up to see all limits on making purchases have been removed. AMC and GME were limited until today, the others lifted earlier this week. Wondering whether you think there will be another push or if it’s dead dead.   I’m thinking they have strategically removed the limits on a Friday so if it does spike again they can do their shady methods over the weekend, but now we’re getting into the conspiracy side of things.   Thoughts?
2 GME at $368. My balls are overwhemingly big

Isn’t this exactly what Master Cuban meant?!
we’re bruised and battered...  but the restrictions are gone now and we’re still strong in will and numbers... this is where we do what we do!!  If the movement is REAL then we can do it again.  Send the message again!  Start buying!  It’s a BARGAIN right now.  NOTHING is stopping us from doing it again.  $NOK $GME $AMC

Officially out. Lost around $600
The squeeze done squoze. Loved memes but the writing is on the wall.   This is getting increasingly conspiratorial. I think it’s worth reading congresses report, because it’s really level.   TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND DON’T $ROPE
Losing hope on my AMC 2/5 calls... Fuck it YOLO!
Hoping that the squeeze would have happen midweek. Have held like a retard. Unless something incredible happens tomorrow, I’m losing all that I put in these calls. I am a true idiot but will buy more and hold longer.
Loss porn  💪 I will hold for my son.. There should be something there 15 years from now hold  💪. Gain for the future.. long term  💪

Damage control?
New GME?!?!?!
Yo guys just did some le epic DD and found this amazing option think if we all hop in on it and never sell it could be a potential gold mine within the next 2 - 3 weeks. This is A DEFINITE FUCKING HOLD TO THE FUCKING MOON!!!!!!  Anyway 4k at $2
Wall street bets
Honestly. Its in the title of the sub. Its a bet. If you got into the GME and AMC stuff you joined high rollers table. You dont fold because the flop wasnt perfect. The HF wagered against us again. We wait until the flop. Or fold now and lose what you lost now. But dont cry about it man.
I get paid today you apes   you know what that means right?
More GME & AMC to buy and hold.   I was one of the smooth brains that bought at $230 expecting it to go to $1000. At this point in time there is no point for me to sell at all.   If GME and AMC get squozed again to a level that makes me profitable you better believe I’m getting a tattoo on my arm about it.  Last thing; anyone think INDX is a good move ?
The world is already talking about the squeeze in the past tense. The only place where people believe the squeeze is still coming in the place where a majority has a vested interest in seeing the price rise. Consider that when you think if you want to continue holding.
Look at the chart available and tell me you don't see the squeeze in action. It is literally history. As a whole, congratulations, you made history. So why are you still holding the bags?      Consider this article:        It talks about South Korea banning short selling, and also mentions off-handedly that the wall street hedges had to buy the stock to cover their losses, driving the price up. The \ \ only\ \  place people deny that their covered their shorts is here, where people are in denial and desperately want it to be true. Everywhere else in the world, it's a simple statement of fact.      There's literally not a single reason outside of blind hope and desire for another rise to believe gme will spike again in value. Cut your losses.

I’ve seen a few posts saying “i’m going to sell...” as the title, with something like “at 1k   ” as the description or something, and I feel like it could drive people to sell their stocks if they don’t click on it — they might not see the description and think everybody’s selling. Idk, it just feels off to me.
Holding til we get to Valhalla      🥒🥒🥒
Good news bois!
100% proof that Melvin are shaking in their shorts a lesson in advanced economic theories.
Prospect Theory:      THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK   The prospect theory can also be known as the loss-aversion theory. Prospect theory states that people's perceptions of gain and loss are skewed. That is, people are more afraid of a loss than they are encouraged by a gain. If people are given a choice of two different prospects, they will pick the one that they think has less chance of ending in a loss, rather than the one that offers the most gains.    Rational Expectations Theory:  The rational expectations theory states that the players in an economy will act in a way that conforms to what can logically be expected in the future. Based on the Prospect Theory above, Hedge Funds are expecting you to act rationally (sell when a stock goes down).   Instead if you hold IT BREAKS THE SYSTEM AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.      The Odd Lot Theory:  The odd lot theory uses the sale of odd lots – small blocks of stocks held by individual investors – as an indicator of when to buy into a stock. Investors following the odd lot theory buy in when small investors sell out. The main assumption is those small investors are usually wrong.   THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND HOW THEY ARE COLLUDING WITH OTHER HEDGE FUNDS TO GET YOU TO SELL.      Greater Fool Theory:  The greater fool theory proposes that you can profit from investing as long as there is a greater fool than yourself to buy the investment at a higher price. This means that you could make money from an overpriced stock as long as someone else is willing to pay more to buy it from you.   HEDGE FUNDS THINK YOU ARE ALL FOOLS, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL TO THEM SO THEY CAN DRIVE THE PRICE BACK UP.       THEY WANT TO WIN, THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERYONE.  It's so easy to see if you look at a 10 day chart with Bollinger Bands and check the Bollinger Bands Crossover and Bollinger Band Percent B. The correlation trending indicator will show you exactly what I wrote in the Odd Lot theory.  It becomes even more obvious when you put overlay a VWAP to the Typical Price on a 30 day chart. You can use this to identify the regression divergence which results in the recursive media oscillator. When you look at it you'll notice the short stair and short ladder attacks are   this week.
Biden’s stimulus plan
I am done. I hate everyone here who made me think AMC would go up. Yea I should of never went all in, but if it wasn't for Robinhood 2 weeks ago this would of hit $20 again. I hate myself and everyone here for listening. This is done and so am I..
Next trade - let’s go in tits up
$DM - I’ll keep this short What is DM? Desktop Metals What do they do? They make metal and carbon fiber 3D printing accessible to all engineers, designers, and manufacturers. Why go tits up batshit crazy on buying DM?  - no denying 3D printing is the future and has just started its practical applications, DM is THE leader - Backed by one of our favorite billionaires, Chamath  - Better future prospects than AMC and GME combined (I know I’ll get a lot of hate for this)  Let’s do the right thing and go tits up!
Is all this really doing anything?
To anyone still holding and not willing to sell and take the loss and move on I have a question for? What’s the point? What’s the point of holding and not selling and just going to the next trade. Those hedge funds aren’t scared and have made a lot of money shorting at the top. Obviously we have seen how corrupt SEC and the brokers have been and should release that they will continue to screw over the retail traders every time they have the chance too. All these meme stock will never even have the possible to go to the moon with all the trading restrictions that would be set in place.   I just want to   are you still holding and when will you sell?   Not trying to be a    I’m just truly interested in what people are thinking about this
Misleading headline vs the actual article

$BB TO THE FUCKING MOON
Memes aside, do a little research and check out what Blackberry has going for them. Only positive news coming out of their   lately. I think it was unfortunate that they got grouped in with AMC and GME as they represent the safest long term buy IMO. Position: 340 @ $   edit: not financial advice. something else about not being an advisor. make your own damn decisions.
Psychological Numbers
Seems to me there is a very calculated effort to keep the stock price for GME and AMC at certain numbers that will wear down holders into selling. Yesterday they closed at just a few cents under $50 and $7. How demoralizing for those who have been watching their investments/gains slowly bleed out. I hope those psychological numbers don't work. I'm curious to see if they hover just under $50 and $7 again today. Everything just appears so manufactured.... I'm dumb.
CARMAT AESON ARTIFICAL ❤️HEART❤️ DD
# 1. WHO IS CARMAT ?  CARMAT was founded by Alain Carpentier in 2008, he is known to have performed the first artificial heart implant in Europe in 1986. He is also the father of the mitral valve repair techniques.  The biggest player behind this company is Airbus which co-founded it.  # 2. WHO IS AESON ?  Aeson was a king of Iolcus in ancient Greece but more importantly he reincarnated into the most advanced artificial heart currently on the market (UE). It’s currently the only product of CARMAT.  # 3. WHO IS ALCAR ?  ALCAR is the ticker name on Euronext. (For retards who can’t buy EU stocks go to chapter 10 )  # 4. CAN I HAVE MORE INFORMATIONS ON THIS AESON ?  You need first to understand there is multiple categories for medical cardiac devices :  1.   LVAD   Left Ventricular Assist Device 2.   RVAD   Right Ventricular Assist Device 3.   BiVAD   Biventricular Assist Device 4.   TAH   Total Artificial Heart  As a retard you would think that TAH is amazing and so Aeson should be category 4. This not the case. Aeson is so fucking amazingly advanced that they had to create a new category :      PHRT   Physiologic Heart Replacement Therapy  This is the only device in this category and due to the difficulty of the task, there is no other devices which is going to be able to compete with Aeson in the near future  (>10 years)  So why is this AESON so fucking amazingly advanced ?  1.   Pulsatility :   The artificial heart mimics a real heart with 2 pumps, 2 ventricles, 4 valves. 2.   Autoregulation :   The embedded sensors and microprocessors allow a live response to changing patient physiological needs. (It automatically adjusts if the patient walks, runs, sleeps, etc.. ; like a real heart) 3.   Hemocompatibility :   All the surfaces in contact with blood are totally hemocompatible.  Compared to other similar cardiac medical devices,Aeson is really safe. It is the only one which didn’t provoke any stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding or infection at the cable site (This artificial heart still uses an external battery) in any of the study participants.  # 5. SO CAN AESON BE USED COMMERCIALLY IN EU AND US RIGHT NOW ?  Not so fast, not so fast...  If it was 100% the case, the rocket would already have launched a long time ago !  There is 4 uses category for this device type :  1.   BTR    Bridge To Recovery 2.   BTT    Bridge To Transplantation 3.   BTB    Bridge To Bridge 4.   DT    Destination Therapy  The final target is DT ( Destination Therapy ), which means that the heart is going to be used as a permanent implant. In December 2020, Carmat received CE marking for BTT.  It means that it can be used, for now, as a temporary solution for patients which can receive real ❤️ transplantation but are still on the waiting list. Carmat, genius as they are, will also use the data from BTT patients to push for the DT.  The first commercial implants are going to be in Germany in Q2 2021 as they are ready to reimburse it.  In parallel, another study (EFICAS) is starting in France in Q2 2021 to drive Aeson adoption, support the value proposition and mainly to get French reimbursement.  In the US, They are starting the EFS (Early Feasibility Study) in Q1 2021 (now). 3 centers in the US are already trained and ready to implant their first patients.  # 6. OK COOL ! BUT WHAT IS THE MARKET SIZE ?  Currently the EU market for BTT is estimated to be of a minimum size of 2000 patients / year.  Right now Germany is the focus as it represents 40% of the EU market (800). France is following with 14% of the market (280). The competitors did less than 60 interventions in Germany and France last year on this type of patient (BVAD / Syncardia). Which is showing that the market is currently without any real competition as the concurrent products aren’t really as convincing which can explain their small volumes.  The combined EU-US market for DT is estimated to be around 180’000 / year.  On these 180’000 patients, around   are getting a real heart transplantation each year which is around 5’500. Which gives a market size of 174’500.  The market size is also growing each year for multiple reason :    Ageing of population (boomers dying)   The fatness of fat people is becoming more prevalent. (not fat shaming intended)   The number of real ❤️ transplants could soon slow down as there will be less car accidents with new autopilots system (thanks daddy elon). An estimated 33% of all organ transplants come from deadly traffic collisions.  # 7. BUT CAN CARMAT PRODUCE ALL THESE HEARTS ?  Carmat finished building its first factory in France last year. It will be soon able to produce    800 ❤️/ year  . As we see the current EU BTT market is large enough for this first factory.  The timing is really good as they will be able to optimize and streamline the industrialization and production process before the CE destination therapy marking and the BBT / DT FDA approval.  With the EU BTT market and current production capabilities, Carmat can partially finance the future studies, it’s development needs and new factories. This can prevent too much share dilution.  It is possible that for future factories in the US, Carmat could partner up with a big name (Edwards, Medtronic, Abbott, Johnson & Johnson, Boston Scientifics, etc... ). A partnering would give Carmat more credibility and a bigger commercial strike force in Uncle Sam Country.  # 8. LET’S SPEAK $$ /  REVENUES  / VALUATION  (QUALITY MATH ECONOMICS TIME )    SOURCES OF REVENUES    The 2 main sources of revenues for CARMAT are going to be :      Sales of Aeson :   We are going to do a conservative estimate of the price of AESON at $150’000 which is more or less the current price of the less advanced Syncardia TAH (the LVAD is $100’000 but not really comparable)     Aeson maintenance :   They can be conservatively estimated to be around $10’000/year    REVENUES ESTIMATES        Short term revenues estimates  , I am going to use the future production capabilities of the current factory -> 800 ❤️ per year. I won’t be using the maintenance revenues as in the short term only BTT category is used.     Medium term revenues estimates,   I’m going to use a pessimistic 5% market share.     Long term revenues estimates 1  , I’m going to go with the number of 25’000 heart which was a minimal target by the Prof. Christian Latrémouille, currently Director of Surgical Affairs at Carmat. This is still only 14% of market share on a market without real competition, it can still be seen as conservative     Long term revenues estimates 2,   I’m going to go with an arbitrary but realistic  30% market share.  For mid and long term, I’m going to use a conservative 5 years average survival rate for maintenance revenues (It should be a much longer)       TIME REFERENCE   MATH   REVENUES    :- :- :-   SHORT TERM (BTT ONLY): 800❤️ x $150’000 $120M   MID TERM ( \ 174’500)❤️  ( $150’000 + (5 $10’000)) $1B   LONG TERM 1 25’000❤️  ( $150’000 + (5 $10’000)) $5B   LONG TERM 2 ( \ 174’500)❤️  ( $150’000 + (5 $10’000) $      CARMAT VALUATION (P/S RATIO ADVANCED ANALYSIS)    We are going to do a quick autistic but realistic valuation of CARMAT by comparing its revenues to 2 random companies in more or less the same sector (P/S ratio).    SARTORIUS P/S = 13  (4 FEB 2021)   ABIOMED P/S = 18  (4 FEB 2021)  From This let’s take a pessimistic starting P/S of 12 for our beloved CARMAT  My advance prediction model also predict a lowering P/S when the company gets bigger. (Because most of the times the growth is slowing(which wouldn’t necessary be the case for carmat… but whatever)) -> I thereby announce a pessimistic -2 P/S for each row in the following table (for big brain people : P/S = ((7-n)\ 2)    TIME REFERENCE   MATH   VALUATION    :- :- :-   SHORT TERM $120M \  12(P/S) $    MID TERM $1B \  10(P/S) $10B   LONG TERM 1 $5B \  8(P/S) $40B   LONG TERM 2 $  \  6(P/S) $63B     SO HOW MUCH MY SHARES WILL BE WORTH ?      Currently there is   shares each worth $36 (4 FEB 2021)   for a total ridicul valuation of 457M (20 times less than fraud NKLA)  In mid / late 2021 there will probably be a share dilution to finance the future growth. But don’t worry, it will only help it to produce more ❤️. Let’s say they add a big amount of 2M shares between each row because why not and we are trying to do pessimistic revenues.       TIME REFERENCE   MATH   SHARE PRICE   RETURN   ROCKET RATING    :- :- :- :- :-   SHORT TERM $  /   $98   172%       MID TERM $10B /   $598   1561%        LONG TERM 1 $40B /   $2139   5842%         LONG TERM 2 $63B /   $3043   8350%              # 9. OK I SMELL TENDIES ! BUT WHAT ELSE ?    The US EFS won’t cost a dime as carmat will get paid for each used ❤️.   There are a lot of catalysts on the calendar this year. (first us implantation, first german commercial implantation, etc...)   The margin on medical devices is huge (Stefan Piat (CARMAT CEO) is targeting 70%   )   The market size I used only takes into account the current AESON which by its size can’t fit into your wife's chest neither in her asian boyfriend chest. Carmat is already working on a smaller ❤️ which would more than double the market size (Women + Asia)      I spoke about the market growth but didn’t took it into account in my advanced model      Stephan Piat had a high level job in Johnson & Johnson and Abbott, good relations can help sweet deals to be made.    # 10. BUT THE STOCK IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPOOR...  Stocks in europoor are worldwide famous for having a low valuation. Which is in fact a good occasion to get it before it comes to the US where valuation is without any known limits ( ) !  When asked about a NASDAQ introduction, Stefan Piat answered (  2021): ”It makes a lot of sense, it really is on the table” .  # 11. BUT I NEVER INVEST IN BIOTECH COMPANIES WHICH STILL NEED AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THEIR PRODUCT !  It’s true that investing in small biotech companies is not for small balls investors. But if you followed carefully (which you didn’t), you would have understood that even in the improbable event that Carmat can’t have the DT (again really improbable, more a question of when), my model shows that Carmat would still be worth more than 36$ a share solely on taking into account the EU BTT market.  # 12. LAST WORD  It is important to understand that, currently, only 25 to 45% of the 180’000 yearly potential patients are surviving more than one year. Aeson is not a comfort medical device, it is a necessity for a lot of people. There is no real competition and there won’t be before a long time. This product is the result of more than 12 years of research and studies made by worldwide specialists. In my opinion, it is really hard to see Karma(t) not succeed in the next few years.  # 13.

All I see is 📜   on GME
RUN to the future
First off, this is not financial advice, I am literally a stoned monkey, I am not a qualified individual. This is just my opinion about a stock I like, and a problem that I feel I can help address as an individual investor.  Secondly, HOLD THE LINE @ 69, 8 shares @ 140 cuz poor college student. You know what I'm talking about.  Third, Positions or GTFO           Alright so to the point. In case you didn't know, the climate is fucked, and continues to be fucked.          Green energy is going to be a booming industry in the next few years as the climate situation comes more into the American social consciousness. Though I'm not expecting much from the Biden administration, they have rejoined the Paris Agreement. Additionally, loud progressives and Bernie Sanders as the head of the Senate Budget Committee points towards climate action being addressed soon. When this happens, it will probably take the form of requiring energy providers to overhaul their energy sources to renewable resources. This has been done recently at the state level, and the US government likes to work off of precedent.    .       How does SunRun fit in?    As a zoomer, there are sever things I feel like I understand about Americans and about the American economy.   Americans pay for convenience, and they'd rather not think about the hard stuff.   This can be shown from the continued embrace of Amazon, to every mom and pop shop that gets shut down when a walmart opens up in town. So what happens when an electricity company decides to tell it's customers that they should use solar panels to help save them money? What happens when those customers aren't just residential customers but businesses with bigass roofs as well?   They save money.        And guess what people like to do? Exactly.    Sunrun has become the second largest solar company in the US since opening in 2007, and sells itself as a company that takes care of all the hard shit for the customer.   "Once a customer decides to proceed with the installation, Sunrun’s BrightPathTM software uses satellite images and its database of thousands of solar panel designs to find the best fit. Sunrun has developed a network of installation teams consisting of employees and licensed partners, who then visit the home to evaluate the design selection. Only after this step would Sunrun pick the appropriate solar panel, which would generally fit into four distinct types – monocrytalline, polysilicon, thin film silicon, and building integrated photovoltaic panels (BIPV). "  Combine this with the fact that Sunrun operates in 20 states and has been seeing consistent growth for the past few years, as well as their acquisition of Vivint Solar in 2020 means they will do nothing but grow for the next few years.     .  I like the stock. I don't know when they'll reach the sun, but they'll get there.
TD Ameritrade WILL NOT LET ME BUY GME
How do i fix this? i is retard. wanna go fishing? Td bad guys, no have stock left? me confused
It's so strange to me that people will FOMO in at $350 but won't risk buying at $50-60
Like think about it, what's more likely, It's goes to $100 and you double your money, or $400 miraculously doubles to $800?   Even Warren Buffett himself once said "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."  Think about how when you were FOMOing in at $300+ how much you wished you got in lower. Now may be that chance. (Or not lol).
Dear god Gme

ITS HAPPENING I BOUGHT GME FIRST TIME THIS MORNING FOR $1000 WE NEED TO HOLD THE LINE
Hey guys, this is really easy. Instead of telling us all how wrong we are. Buy some PUTs and put your money where your mouth is.
These hate GME guys are all full of lip service but GUARANTEED are too chicken to buy puts.  If you are so bearish on GME, why not buy some puts and put your money where your mouth is?     I'm holding 28 shares.  Forget the haters.
Just a curious mind here
So, I was in a chat with a guy I know about the current GME case. The hedgefunds are trying to stop people from buying stocks, while the common people are buying and holding. Meanwhile, people are saying this is a clear undermining (or whatever word I should use) of the free market. Then I suddenly got reminded, that just last fall/december a lot of scalpers tried ordering tons of nvidia cards, playstation 5's and xboxes. Then supplierers cancelled orders with more than a certain number of purchases, and got almost applauded for that. And that got me thinking, what really is the "free market"? And does that mean we should be able to sell and deny selling to whoever we want to? Just trying to understand why scalpers apparently are not allowed, while stopping us from buying those stocks is also not allowed. I understand why, and at the same time do not. Cause either both should be allowed, or both should not be, according to my logic.
You win some you lose   a lot..

Thank you so much guys!
Bought $41k worth of stock (almost literally all I've got to my name) $22/stock, sold just now at $79/stock. I was so fucking afraid that I was going to have to leave this thing empty handed after getting my hopes up, and I'm just so fucking grateful y'all pushed it up again so that I could finally let this nightmare be over, and still having profited a fair bit.   Love you all    DIAMOND HANDS FOREVERRR!!! If it does go to the moon, I wont be bitter in the slightest, I will be happy for y'all, you deserve it!!

GameStop mania may not have been the retail trader rebellion it was perceived to be, data shows
$BB is not a meme stock! It has beat the memes every trading day since the RH price attack. If you’re not on the $BB  , you’re about to be left behind.
Listen up, the hedgies have been trying the same short ladder attacks on $BB as they have $GME / $AMC and the rest. But every day it’s bounced back harder and stronger.  I am holding my $GME into the ground if I need to because I don’t want    boning my mom.   But I’m buying the hell out of $BB rn. It is by far the lowest risk of the bunch with real fundamentals behind it. That’s why it’s been able to hold the line better than the rest.  This is a legit tech company with some solid patents and breakout potential with big partnerships on the horizon.   What’s more, $BB has been shorted to hell like all of the rest. The same people who doubled down on their shorts on $AMC and $GME have been hammering down on $BB to spread the risk, except they seriously messed up here as this one actually has sharp teeth.  Short volumes have been lower than the others but still through the roof:    There won’t be the same level squeeze we saw with $GME but there’s going to be a squeeze.  This is a SAFE $30 stock in the very near future.  The buying opportunity right now is very real.  ——this is not financial advice bla bla I eat crayons
Just Hold A Little Longer Man
$LGND Is Up 7% With Low Volume
Seems like a start of a short squeeze to me. Not many sellers but people are buying regardless of the price.     I like the stock :)
I envy you lucky retard dip buyers
AMC has shorts bought between $2-$6 the first week all this went down that have been rolling over. They must be covered and the stock is at $7 , which means when the market closes the price will go up. AMC is a successful theater company and the biggest in the biz. AMC is NOT a get rich quick scheme. The stock topped $15 before wallstreetbets got ahold of it, and it will get back there. BUY THE DIP. HOLD. DIAMOND HANDS BABY. I have 82 shares (all i could afford) and I’M NOT LEAVING. ITS NOT OVER. DON’T SELL TIL YOU SEE GREEN! not investment advice.
Middle idiots of history. Cant stop, wont stop, GameStop
Taking a break to learn (not a meme)
I’ve really enjoyed the memes and enthusiasm here, but if I’ve learnt one thing the past few weeks it’s that I know 2/3s of fuck all about the stock market.   I’ve lost a bit of money, not much but enough to know I’m gambling rather than making informed (although risky) leaps of faith. Some people here  have thrown ridiculous amounts of money in from loans, potentially landing them in crippling debt or at risk of embezzlement.   So, I’m going to keep lurking around here to see what happens, but I don’t think I will invest again until I’ve read some books and levelled up my understanding.   In meantime I hope you   🌕  TL/DR   dumb,    learn to read and then  🌕
Someone hold me and tell me it's gonna be okay. I've already lost a decent amount of money on AMC. Is it really gonna go up?

WSB accidentally makes a half court shot
I’m not in enough to where this is going to financially ruin me.... yet. Buying the dip     like my foreautists before me.
Wow.. RH ad just.. WTFBBQ
Mind you i never touched RH with a 1000ft pole. But this showed up on my FB feed today which cracked me up.
This is an article from august.. just something to think about ! #amc
Slow and Steady.
Please stop with the huge emotional momentum swings (good or bad) and posts saying "IT'S HAPPENING!!!!%!" Or doomsday posts saying "lol GME tards funni, bagholdimg idi0ts".  There's rationale for continuing to buy the dip and hold. There's plenty of it. It also is reasonable to say it's going to be a lot more difficult now, but it's still possible.  I don't have a huge stake in GME or AMC (5@ 188 and  , respectively) because I'm only investing what I can afford, but I'm holding patiently despite all the rhetoric one way or the other.  Slow and steady folks.
Netflix is trading at $522 per share. Gamestop + Netflix model!!!
Netflix is trading at $552 per share.  Imagine Gamestop has their own set top box CONSOLE and controllers where you can stream 1000s of games for a monthly subscription as well as mobile version and it's all integrated for massive multiplayer online.  Then they could start their own studio like netflix does with movies, but for videogames.. With their strategic alliance with Microsoft, hmmm!?  Then they wouldn't need to be symbiotic with all the other platforms. They could make revenue with their own hardware.. it could also have netflix app.. netflix+gamestop.  So with Microsoft alliance they collab on the Xbox games.  With their in-store pc building the get into pc niche.  With esports they'd be locked..  what does that leave for playstation?  Scraps.  Steam?  IDK  I like the stock!!!!!  PC Hardware     Microsoft Strategic Alliance     Had streaming division in 2014, but now we have 5g speed for lagging reduction on mobile.      They knew what they needed to do in 2010     Gamestop social concept store     Ryan Cohen just followed Steam an EA sports on twitter.
Still holding like I never left this biatch. Can’t buy a guy tho. How did Heath Ledger become the Joker?
The squeeze done? Then explain why:
1. Webull just removed their ability to view into the order book past 30 orders. Yesterday I could click in and see our limit orders. They don't allow that now.     (What I was seeing yesterday consistently despite never seeing our limits pop up in the order book for the past 2 weeks, even at the peak of the share price)  2. Short interest data I saw this morning (I thought it didn't come out till the 9th but I found this this morning):     3. Robinhood keeps removing your limit sells right before market open, regardless the price of the stock. Happened multiple days in a row to me. I have to set it up again everyday despite entering a good till cancel.  Two days ago the stock was 76 and I set a limit for 1500 (the max it would allow me because of stock price) the limit was accepted and sat until 916 am yesterday when I got an email that was limit was rejected because it was too high. Freaking out because I think GME crashed I open the app to see the price of GME is now 10 dollars higher than when I set my limit order.  Now why does this matter? Well look up share hypothecation and what it does. This isn't advice just super shady shit I've been observing and documenting.  Now if anyone can explain how all of this is nonsense and I'm retarded please do. But my day trading buddy is scratching his balls confused when presented with the same info. So I'm convinced I found some stuff. That and the post about the math behind the shorts and the volume not matching the price swings in either direction. Just too many things going on.  I feel like the Charlie Day meme from Horrible Bosses. You know the one. Someone rip down my conspiracy wall with some data. Please? I want to believe I'm wrong because I'm a nobody so if a nobody can piece together how easy this manipulation is to see that has me worried for the future of all markets.
DD on Naked Short Selling, Failure to Deliver, and Short Interest - Who didn’t play by the rules?
First, some terms (skip if you know them):  #What is naked shorting?  The  illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. This practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality. You can’t sell something that doesn’t exist.      #What is Failure to Deliver?  Occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation. (  I borrow shares to short sell that don’t actually exist, so I am unable to actually deliver the shares I am selling to a buyer)     #What is Short Interest?   The number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out (  returned to the borrower)      #How are these terms related?  While short interest and FTD are to some extent natural market phenomena,  there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest, high FTD rates, and the existence of naked short selling for a stock. (Source    Perhaps more importantly, the above article establishes that FTDs are not “random” occurrences, and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases.  #Was there naked short selling with GME?  Almost certainly, yes. GME has been on the NYSE securities threshold list every trading day since December 8, meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days. The SEC is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations.       Moreover, GME short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since December 8 (average short sales >50% of total sell volume)     #What does this all mean?  It means that someone(s) cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions. And the SEC didn’t do shit about it.   #Ok so they cheated, no surprise there, what can I do about it?  1) Submit a TCR complaint to the SEC    2) Contact your local, state, and federal representatives and tell them that you are very upset.
Uh oh... I think they’re on to us
Yesterday I... paperhanded and sold my 15 GME shares at $55 after being hit by a major wave of FUD...
Good thing humans learn from their mistakes cause BOY OH BOY I'M BACK ON THIS BITCH @ $65 WITH ALL MY 15 SHARES AGAIN.  Never making this mistake again.   SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA BUY HIGH AND SELL LOW SO THAT YOU CAN BUY LOW AND NEVER SELL!  GME 4 LIFE!

Is there a reason why Augmented Reality stocks like MVIS and NEXCF get no love on reddit despite their potential?
I’m confused over all of the AMC stuff...
How much is this actually gonna peak at, I’ve heard 20, 150-200, 1k, 10k??
Alright apes, im all in, its not much but its honest work  ‍♂️

I got into $GME at $110 and then again when it dipped to $85, and again at $70. I'm using all my extra cash on this.  I started playing with investing a few years ago when I opened a Robinhood account (which I closed last year before it was cool gg REEEE) and I'm about halfway through the Khan videos on the stock market.   I'm the type of person who literally clips coupons when I go to Dollar General, that's how responsible and frugal I am. But I'm not nervous, I feel like $GME is a pretty solid stock at this point, thanks to WSB and a few others. Is it going to the moon? Hopefully. If it doesn't, will I be okay? Hell yeah, mama didn't raise no bitch.   Diamond hands or gtfo

Loss Porn - Still HOLDING
Long post, but this is for the people who have always loved the stock. Just my opinion. What do y’all think?
I saw this tweet today from S3 partners, who provide the short numbers that people on WSB were saying were changed because they changed the formula to calculate short interest to include synthetic longs or some shit (I kinda don’t really know what that means lmao just basically that some people were saying they numbers reported are lower than what the old formula would have calculated them to be at according to Reddit comments, I can’t actual fully believe anything without my own knowledge in the area):     This says there are   shares still shorted       IMPORTANT     Now I have no idea if that includes people shorting the price on the way down from 400 so if it’s mostly those people then this probably  doesn’t mean anything that significant.    .                   .  But it it’s the shorts from the original positions the original play was based on, then look at this article from the 1st:      remaining  So according to S3 data who the media are all quoting, people only exited   of those positions this whole week.  What if maybe they blocked the gamma squeeze from happening that would have occurred if the original viral momentum led to not only a huge pump in price but a punch in the face to the hedge funds who would be forced to exit their positions without a way to stop the price increase by imposing the restrictions, especially with RobinHood because they had a lot of momentum from fractional buyers who threw in $20 for the meme.     -What if the red circle is when gamma squeeze started due to the viral nature of this cause of easy access to fractional share buying, and then dip after that is when they restricted buying and killed the initial “meme” momentum.  - And what if the two spikes in the green circle are hedge funds dumping the first half of the short positions in two quick but slightly separate dumps, and then other hedgies that knew the play exiting on those highs after buying in on the low points while retail buyers were blocked which started the price drop.  Weekend happens. Cue misinformation   on Reddit etc to get people to sell, all the trading activity after most restrictions were lifted (but not all)  was retail buyers selling, nobody huge was making any moves. So it was people being scared by the news and buying silver or whatever.  Elon tweeted about destroying shorts during the days of losses after he came back from a Twitter break but hasn’t done anything to do that just yet for him to claim it.  Mark Cuban is silent on Twitter and he at least usually likes a few posts every day.  Both aren’t indicative of anything at all, it’s just something I noticed btw. I’m hoping that the big whales involved in this (not specifically Cuban or Musk, I don’t even know if they have positions or any actual real interest in this) just waiting to strike, perhaps waiting to see the data on the 9th themselves. Maybe making hedgies think the movement’s died down a bit so they keep restrictions off, cause remember there has still been like 500 share restrictions on GME which was obviously to prevent big whales starting a push again. But this time hopefully they know that the whole world is watching them and any new restrictions they pull or “app freezes / server overloads” they pull will be HIGHLY scrutinized by the public, the government, and many other financial groups. Plus I hope most people got off apps that restricted them last time and onto ones that don’t. We need more fractional share trading apps like RobinHood that have good user interfaces...   All we need is that same momentum again. That “meme” status. Someone big needs to do something for the lulz (for the cause of course). The hedgies could potentially still be sitting on a large chunk of their initial calls back at like $10 and using this disinformation   to try to push the price back to around that area. If people keep selling you’ll let them do that.  Personally, and that means I don’t want anyone  to trade off my advice because I’m not a financial advisor, but I would dream about holding because we need to wait for:  - The short report on Feb 9th for the short data from 1/31 to see if they were telling the truth about their level of short positions.  - The congressional hearings on GameStop with Vlad, DFV, GameStop execs, etc on the 18th  - The results of the SEC investigation.  I’d love to be a shareholder with a potential say in things through all this. And if the price goes close to 0 through all this, that’s fine because I’ll dream about buying more shares over time to bring down my buy in average and then hopefully by 2025 the new execs’ push to pivot to also focusing on e-commerce and esports will pay off and I’ll make some good gains.  But again, I’m not a financial advisor, this is not advice, this is literally all just a shitpost where I’m daydreaming about stuff and writing it on the internet. I love the community that this created, we didn’t want to overthrow democracy, we just wanted to invest in a stock we loved for a company some of us have long term interest in and then also potentially make some short term gains while giving the finger to a cocky hedge fund in the process.

CNBC can eat a bag of dicks, claiming we had nothing to do with GME.

GameStonk Thesis
“  🏽 GameStonk” Thesis:      1.    The surge in GameStop pricing was from supply and demand from the sudden viral spread        -we did not see the sustained and prolonged volume we would need if the shorts were to cover their position, just retail jumping into the hype        -there is even some evidence (the number of failure to delivers in the data the last several months) to suggest that the surge in pricing was partially hedge funds covering illegal “Naked Shorts” and having to hop into the buying frenzy to cover their ass now that the rest of the situation is being more closely monitored by authorities and that’s a large enough infraction to actually get in trouble but hard to prove if you cover it in time.       2.    Hedges set a second round of shorts at higher prices        -rhe placing of GME on SHO (a watchlist) and NYSE restricting further shorts indicates this        -this could be an accounting trick to lower there average loss point later, not just out of arrogantly thinking they will discourage people, but it could be realistically be either      3.    Thursday/Friday we saw a massive amount of Capital being removed from the broader stock market       -this could have been drawn out by Hedge Funds to pay for cyber disruption  , take care of borrow fees on the outstanding shorts, and fund sustained ‘short ladder attacks’ (things we see happening that artificially push down the price), and eventually to help cover the shorts      4.    The % shortage of the total stock went down due to market manipulation         -‘Synthetic longs’ are in essence a fake stock that only exists on the balance sheets, which can be used to give the appearance on financial records of having covered your short position for a fraction of the cash it takes to actually do so, and can be used to spoof SEC data with relatively minor consequences      5.    There has been a massive cyber disruption           -400k deepfakes+as many as 10% additional bots, and a hostile takeover of the Subreddit WallstreetBets      6.    There has been sustained, coordinated low volume attacks to drive down prices          -AMC and GME stock is directly correlated (an overlayed picture is almost identical)since the supply and demand rocket began last week, indicated coordinated price suppression           -Despite this sustained downward pressure, now that retail investors are unrestricted in buying again it seems like redditors with higher psychological buy in and risk tolerance are instead buying more shares and holding the rest with prices holding much steadier even as volume has increased directly coinciding with the reintroduction of Retail investors to the market      7.    At prices under 100 a share, we LIKE THIS STOCK given the underlying fundamentalist term prospects of the company; /u/DeepFuckingValue’s in depth analysis explaining that position was what started the meme and how they stumbled into realizing the whole “the stock is over 100% shorted” situation           -Lowering our avg price point to as low as possible beneath that means even if we assume that there is no big squeeze coming and this is just prolonged volatility, we can sell at that price in 6 mo-1 yr to recoup investment which makes continued investment under 100 a logical way to hedge our bets.       8.    Even though this is the stock market, behavior economics reminds us that group psychology and the psychology of mass movements is applicable           -The initial highbrow analysis and memeification spread like wildfire, instilling near cult like influence, while Redditors (used to fighting bot driven influence  ) respond with extra intensity if they view their platform as under attack.       9.    In 2008 this situation was precedented with VW stocks on the Frankfurt exchange; the main difference is it was organized Hedge Funds involved         -without anywhere near the capital raised just to spend manipulating the market or as much to lose on the line, 6 trading days of around -50% decline bc of short ladders were still paid for before the shorts were called in         -the data from VW in 08 also extrapolates over to this scenario as a 28K as max price and 10 K as safe exit point      10.    I would bet more that I’m right and Wall Street is corrupt and convincing/tricking corporate media into pushing a narrative that benefits them while spreading disinformation online that that hundreds of thousands of people ways better that at this than me (including M. Cuban, Elon Musk,) are wrong; especially when being right means changing my life and my community and being wrong means learning a funny lesson about group think and economic populism.   Bonus factor that could contribute to a the start of a squeeze:   Ryan Cohen (the   guy who bought 7% of the company and is part of turning it around; the ongoing push to modernize, his presence and a few good recent hires are why we’re long at the stock at 100) has the rights to buy an additional 13% putting his total at 20%.

When a PMCC turns against you.
This is more informative for new people wondering how to handle a trade that goes against them.   I already know the answer to my question but still want to put it out there.  Answer 1.  Don’t trade memes Answer 2. Don’t fucking trade memes Answer 3. Gains are gains.   Opened a PMCC on AMC on Monday for by buying a 1/21/22 $12 C for   and selling a 2/5 $19 C for $  A $570 debit.   I’ve hustled hard and managed the fuck out of the position rolling my short calls and so far have collected a total of $  in credits, my LEAP is worth ~ $3 now, so I am green at least.   My plan from here is to sell very aggressive weekly Calls and watch like a hawk for any dips to buy back and spikes to sell. I knew I shouldn’t fuck with a meme that was in a bubble but did it anyway.   Once I’m in the green idgaf if my leap gets called away. The plan is to get assigned and profit, not baghold a leap.

Thoughts on airlines right now?
So now that we’re getting closer and closer to spring there is more opportunity within airline stocks. A lot of these stocks have not yet recovered from the March crash. Though they are gaining momentum very quickly, the are still far from their price targets. Personally after the research I have done I think they could hit all time highs if this momentum continues into spring. Has anyone else looked into this, would this be a good opportunity for leaps?  Currently I’m playing delta because the seem to be in the best position but I feel like that not the only one that could see growth
all my current investments.
The Squeeze
Just a friendly reminder that until we know the full picture on what the current short position is, institutions will continue to sell off GME on what they believe is a premium. Today’s morning rally is the result of limitations being lifted on popular meme stocks. And the subsequent slide isn’t so much paper hands folding as it is the institutions. But while they’re selling we’re buying. We’re not pumping, we’re squeezing. WSB is going to own this stock like never before. Be ready for the war of attrition.  Obligatory:

Can cloud-connected fly? Wrong answers only.
I'm an independent investor. Any of my position or movements that mirror any other investor is purely coincidence.
If you're holding a position because someone else is.... do you see how a regulator might be able to prove that the person you're following has manipulated you into that position (whether true or not)?    Personally, I don't care what reddit or DFV does.   I do my own due diligence and research, and have decided I like certain stocks.   If my investment strategies mirror or move in tandem with other investors, that is  merely coincidence.  I am not manipulated by any single investors or any collective body of individuals. My research spurces and methodologies are specific to my personal investment strategy but it is, realistically, not the only strategy that can lead to the same conclusion/positions/movements  [Not a lawyer. Not a financial advisor. Not legal advice. Not financial advice]  DFV probably stopped updates for legal reasons; because if the citadel can't kill the "army", they go after it's   perceived   leader.  Even if GME is done... there are other shorts to squeeze. If you,  individually,  would like to support under-valued companies.  I just like the stock. Nothing to do with reddit or DFV or whatever esle. I used to get all my games from there when I was younger. I like the core business but I wanted to see some modernization and changes to certain business practices, etc.. they can't do that with no money, so I gave them some. And the board additions announcement looks promising long term for the company, so I'll hold my position; Regardless of any short squeeze or whatever. My only regret is not getting in  years ago  when I first started looking into investing, but  ‍♂️.   If you like a company/stock, there's nothing stopping you from investing. [Unless brokers prevent you from spending your "dollar votes" on specific companies, for limited time, conveniently as hedge funds are in a known position where more money into those specific companies/stocks is a detriment to their short position.... but I'm sure it's nothing]--  It's s essentially like shark tank. But instead of 1 or 2 investors with millions, you have millions of them with a few dollars.  If enough $1 investors jump in, that can help  any  company move forward with plans to improve, monetize better, or expand.  GME was failing, quite miserably. Then one guy had had faith in the core underlying business. He gave his opinion, and because other people can see/hear/read other people's opinions, they saw/heard/read it. Many (but not all) people came to the same realization after doing their own DD. Millions of people who know nothing about investing but simply liked the stock, and collectively, gave the company the funding they needed to improve upon the core business  On the flip side. Hedge funds did not like the company so they effectively stole money from the company's actual value in order to show their dislike. Unfortunately, a company can't improve or prove it's worth with no money to improve, so they kind of sat in their own mess for a while, until enough people started liking the company enough to give them a dollar or two.  It's not market manipulation for multiple people to like chocolate ice cream. It's certainly not market manipulation to reverse ~~actual~~  alleged  market manipulation designed to force chocolate ice cream off the shelves.  DFV is under no obligation to    to the moon. In fact,  he  is already on the moon. 44mil? That's the moon for him. Seems like the moon for me.  His position or lack thereof has no influence on mine. Because DFV hasn't manipulated me into any position. Period.  If you like the stock, hold it. If you don't like the stock, why are you holding it?   It's OK to cash out of you've reached     your     moon.   But if you're holding out because of DFV, a regular is likely to see that as manipulation. FYI. Thats why my position has nothing to do with DFV.
You are holding GME, we are holding GME and we are buying GME again
Summary: Hold/buy to get more tendies    I know you are doubting we are still ALL IN, the increase you saw at 15:59 wasn't a masive buy, was a masive close (buy) of short retailers, you did your first squeeze, small squeeze against retailers. In that moment I feel like we was having 1 short for every 4 buy (Or 5 short every 20) and it turned in a few seconds to only 1 every 20 pumping our rocket to orbit again.  After a masive increase in price new retailer with more money started more short positions, that's why you see it going down, currently we are again almost 1 short every 4. They think you will stop holding and they can steal your banana's. You see it down, but it's not us selling, is they starting more and more short's, if you hold/buy they will be forced to close their positions with a buy and increase our banana's.   If you hold enought until some more people come to GME there will be a masive UP again and short retailers will need to buy again, bringing us to spaceeeeeeeeeeee.  The Hedge funds are way far in space so we need a lot of boost to achive there. We need fuel for it, meme's are the best fuel  Trust me monkey's, Monkey Jesus talked to me in my magic ball that's where the numbers come and I throw the reverse card every time I can  Sorry my bad typing I am a monkey just typing random not a broker/investor/advicer with high studies, do your own decisions on your own risk

"Sike" 101
Regarding GME, the hedge fund buddies involved fucking themselves with a dildo because I guess it's fun for them.  They started naked shorting or just plain shorting with shares borrowed. To create mass panic they raised the price to bring it down with more borrowed shares, however, they didn't account for the retards located her on wallstreetbets. We caught wind of their shenanigans.  They thought WSB was made of   , but we are made of carbon   .  They sold over 100% in short interest, having to also pay a premium. When it was time for the squeeze they put themselves in, they thought it would be best to short >100% so they can at least make some folks realize their gains so the hedges can have more money AND DECREASE THEIR OWN SHORT INTEREST POSITION.  This led to their attempt to psychologically chip away paper hands... Lo and behold, their attempts to drive the price from $  pps, to the $  would allow them to regain the shares they sold short or naked...  So if we hold AND CONTINUE TO HOLD, their psychological attempt to make us sell would actually dig them into a deeper hole.  So I am holding because of    .   So psych 101 or sike 101... We playing them well fellow APES!!!  I eat crayons and made this story out of my ass and various readings this past week.

“Who didn’t make it out?” “Oh, that’s easy,” he said. “The optimists.”
(Short-time ape, first time poster, thank you for the laughs, insanity, and overall bananas in here!)  As we draw nearer to Feb 9, (whether that date continues to have significance or not, who knows!) I thought it was really important to think about this GME situation as a seige.  It's a battle of endurance!  It's a battle of patience!  It's a battle of courage.    is a story about Admiral Jim Stockdale, who was the highest-ranking United States military officer in the “Hanoi Hilton” prisoner-of-war   during the height of the Vietnam War.  He was a prisoner for   EIGHT YEARS  !    Here's an excerpt from the above linked article, but edited for WSB purposes:  `“Who didn’t make it out?”`  `“Oh, that’s easy,” he said. “The optimists.”`  `“The optimists? I don’t understand,” I said, now completely confused, given what he’d said a hundred meters earlier.`  `“The optimists. Oh, they were the ones who said, ‘We’re going to be out by` ~~Christmas~~ `$500.’ And` ~~Christmas~~ `$500 would` (almost) `come, and` ~~Christmas~~ `$500 would go. Then they’d say, ‘We’re going to be out by` ~~Easter~~ `Feb 1.’ And` ~~Easter~~ `Feb 1 would come, and` ~~Easter~~ `Feb 1 would go. And then` \[you get the idea\]`. And they died of` ~~a broken heart~~  `Paper Hands.”`  HODL, my fellow apes!  If you set a time trigger, or if you set a dollar trigger, you're setting yourself up for Paper Hands... and besides, it's more fun to buckle up and watch the fire, isn't it??  No Advice Here!

Sure, companies make money when you buy stock, but actually contributing to their profits keeps the lights on and ensures their continuing success!  Hold and buy! Have a good weekend!     😝
Not just another "diamond hands" post: here's WHY you need to hold
Because GME is still being shorted 226%.  What this means is: as long as you continue to hold, the people who shorted the stock will have to buy it back at the lower price to fulfill the shares they borrowed, whether they want to or not. This will cause the stock to rise. This is called a "short squeeze" and is what happened last week.  Hold.

Is it possible for the hedgefunds to buy back their shares slowly so the stock prices don't skyrocket and retail investors make a profit?
Hedgefunds have naked shorts they need to cover. They know if they buy back in bulks, the stock prices will skyrocket and people will make a good amount from selling their shares. But what if they slowly buy? Yeah, they'll be paying interest daily but at least they'll buy back their shares at a lower price. So is that a possible scenario?
If you own AMC please read this
AMC HOLDERS PLEASE READ THIS  A message to all AMC holders  There’s no need to expand in the last couple of days, our precious AMC stocks have been tanking every day, but I’m here to spread a message of calm and prevent burnouts.  Apart from all the dirty shit they been pulling (I truly believe this ir market manipulation because GME chart looks exactly the same) we have to be calm and trust in AMC here’s why:  •AMC is actually a good long term investment, they been saved from bankruptcy and now they been opening some movie theaters.  •with vaccines we can hope as time progresses, restrictions will ease up and cinemas will be attended again. •right now you might be staring at a 50% or more loss, but be calm, its not irrational to expect the stock to go back to 15-20 at one point in this year. So we might lose these battle, but the war is not over, there’s no point on selling with a loss, also there’s no point on stressing tf out because this isn’t going the way we expected to, be patient and trust the process, Covid won’t last forever and thanks to us AMC is now healthier than it was.
Don't let this disappear: GME trading was halted at 10am to stop growth.

CLOV CALLS OUT HINDENBURG ON ITS BULLSHIT
Clover Health calls Hindenburg attack desperate attempt to position itself as a 'white knight'  # Clover Health calls Hindenburg attack desperate attempt to position itself as a 'white knight'   claiming the tech-focused healthcare company concealed key information from investors, including an active Justice Department investigation. In its response, Clover called Hindenburg’s claims a “desperate attempt for publicity” that disregards the truth.  Hindenburg, which is typically a short seller that bets companies’ stock will go down, said in its report on Thursday that it had no position in Clover, which sells Medicare insurance in mostly low-income areas. Rather, Hindenburg claimed it was issuing the report because it wants the public to know the role short sellers have in “ .”  But Clover suggested Hindenburg is merely trying to redeem its reputation in a climate where short sellers are viewed unfavorably. “Given the market’s latest views on short sellers, we believe that Hindenburg, which takes pains to call out their altruism in saying that they are not short on CLOV stock, is foolheartedly seeking to redeem itself by posturing as a white knight of the financial markets,” Clover , which said it had no knowledge of the Hindenburg report before it was made public on Thursday.  According to Hindenburg, a civil investigative demand letter from the Department of Justice shows it’s investigating 12 issues related to Clover, including its software “Clover Assistant,” as well as kickbacks, marketing practices, and undisclosed third-party deals. The investigation, Hindenburg concluded, presents a potential existential risk for a company that derives almost all of its revenue from Medicare.  The Hindenburg report also took aim at the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by Chamath Palihapitiya that took the tech-focused healthcare company public in January.  In its response, Clover acknowledged the Justice Department’s investigation, though said the company’s lawyers as well as outside and third-party lawyers, including IPO underwriter’s counsel, found it wasn’t material and therefore Clover determined it unnecessary to disclose to investors. The subject “received extensive focus and attention,” Clover said, during both its recent IPO and de-SPAC due diligence processes, and noted it had neither received civil investigative demands nor subpoenas.  Clover also responded to Hindenburg’s claims that its relationship with its subsidiary Seek Insurance was “thinly disclosed,” noting that it doesn’t mention the subsidiary on its website yet tells seniors that it will provide them with unbiased information on finding Medicare plans. In its response, Clover described Seek Medicare as a startup separate from Clover, with its own investor, board of directors, management team, and employees.  In response to Hindenburg’s critique over a reported $200 per patient visit fee that Clover pays to physicians who use its Clover Assistant software, Clover said, “To be clear, the ‘extra $200 per visit’ is not incremental or ‘just to use’ the Clover Assistant, but represents the overall payment that covers both the primary care physician (PCPs) office visit and the use of the Clover Assistant. This translates to roughly twice the traditional Medicare fees paid to PCPs for an office visit, more in line with fees paid to specialists.”  Clover said following Hindenburg’s publication on Thursday, it received an inquiry from the SEC, which the healthcare company said it believed was based on the Hindenburg report.  Hindenburg says its report is based on “more than a dozen interviews with former employees, competitors, and industry experts,” along with government reports and insurance filings.  The short seller is known for issuing a scathing report in September calling the electric truck startup Nikola ( .  While Clover shares tumbled after Thursday’s report, they were up nearly 3% after the market open on Friday.  I AM BETTING ON THE LITTLE GUY, FUCK THIS HEDGE FUND DEFAMMING MY FAV SPAC COMPANY.

Who’s got two thumbs and not selling? This guy!
We might have gotten "bear trapped". Just saying.
Basically a false reversal of a downwards trend.   Bears raise the price, you think the downtrend is over you buy/fomo in. Then they sell at the top to take advantage. And the price drops back down to where it was, or likely even lower.  $90 may have very well been your last chance to get out at a decent price. Some of you might have even bought back in at $70-80 and are already down, you may have been bamboozled.   I really really hope I'm wrong lol.  EDIT: Bull Trap, not Bear Trap. My B.

Is there likely to be any short-term GM bump after their EV Super Bowl ad airs?
Or is that a stupid thought?

Reminder: Robinhood users. Place your shares on a LIMIT ORDER in order to prevent your shares from being lent to short sellers.
Robinhood is lending your shares out to the short sellers. if you place limit orders that wont fill they become "on-order" and robinhood cant touch them!     They have a max 90 days. but considering robinhood keeps cancelling my order in the mornings I can tell it pisses them off. so ill be doing it every single day henceforth

Broker transfer - what's your progress like?
I, like many others jumped ship last week when Robin Hood pulled the fuckery they did. My 401k has been with Fidelity forever, so I decided it was best fit to move assets there.  What's everyone's transfers looking like? I started mine Saturday 01/30 and it's eta is 02/08. My assets from RH actually showed up for two days in my Fidelity account, then disappeared as of yesterday. Still shows in progress. Also, my RH account initially went to 'deactivated/closed' and now it appears to be active and open again with my shares still there. Anyone else dealing with this? Their support is useless.

YOU STARTED THIS, NOW COMMIT TO THE FUCKING PLAY
I'm just going to leave this here for my fellow retard ape brain brethren... If you've lost confidence, if you're scared.... I understand  Also... Fuck you. You wanted to get on this rollercoaster, you bought your ticket, you wanted to play with the big boys, guess what fucknuts? Now we're in the churn, so sack up, and commit to what you fucking started.  Wall Street wins because they don't just go "ah shit, I'm down, guess I better give up and pay out", fuck no, they're animals, they will go to whatever length necessary to win. So cut that defeatism shit out, don't take the L like a bitch, re-evaluate and fight the fuck back.  Was the original DD and thesis good? Yes? Then carry the fuck on.  Did we get the rug pulled out? Yes? Then fucking pivot  Did we pivot successfully to new brokerages? Yes? Then fucking attack!  Remember you asked for this, now see it through. I am with you, millions of retards just like you ARE WITH YOU. So let's go fucking get it!

Treating little red baby candles as Melvin and Hedgie Dick
What diamond hands are showing is huge green penises. If you look at the volume, most of the time you see an overwhelming amount of support for GME, but the price keeps dipping. This is obviously little shortie dick trying to drive the price down, if it’s a bigger red dick it’s probably paper hand bitches selling out at losses (why would you even do that to yourself?). Big green dicks are the real winners, the diamond dicks and clits, the ones that make REAL profit and real change in their lives. You diamond handed Chads and Babes are the ones they fear the most! The price is only going down because they’re selling it to themselves, but if you sell it you give evildoers more power! Holding in the middle of naked put ladder attacks is the most ballsy, most fucking big dick move you can make. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE YOUR POWER AS A RETAIL INVESTOR. THE ONLY WAY YOU LOSE IS IF YOU SELL.   I’m just a retard who eats crayons and sniffs glue don’t listen to me. I’m not offering financial advice.
Not the next GME, but a possibly good investment
This is legit.  CCIV. They are most likely going to buy Lucid Motors, which is the only company to rival Tesla's cars. The stock will skyrocket.  Regardless even if the deal doesn't go through, CCIV is a good stock to invest in.  These are my thoughts, feel free to disagree, i don't mind.

How I feel Holding 20 GME @ 266
Please Listen.
I’m just disappointed that no one makes a research anymore... GME is on NYSE Short Sale Restriction List till 2/8... that means if we hold and buy we can move the price up because they can’t drop the price like they could yesterday they can’t short the price down today like they could yesterday only on the uptick... people don’t know this and there are Also people who joined today and sold today because they wanted a quick profit... its not how that works I’m not optimistic at all but I hope... People are afraid and they are selling... I use   92% people were buying (7% Selling)  when the market opened and now it’s at 80% (20% selling) . This will only happen if people buy and   will know the official shorts position at 2/9 Tuesday. HOLD YOU FOOLS!

Patience is a skill, not a quality
I've noticed sentiment/morale in the community goes WAY UP on days like today and then WAY DOWN on days like yesterday. Just two cents from a late 30s geezer stranger, so take it as you will – be patient. Have a plan, stick to it, and be patient. I've made numerous bad decisions (beyond trading) over the years due to being impatient (and intoxication, but that's another community). Just practice being patient and staying calm. And you can get better and better at patience just like you can at sports or a  's a skill, not an innate quality.  Disclaimer: Part of the reason I wrote this post was to remind myself of this. Hopefully it helps others too.

Why this ape is holding
I’m dumb ape with dumb thought  REASON IM HOLDING        First off, sorry for the poor structure I’m on mobile.  Second disclaimer, I’m an idiot, full blown ape holding onto 1/4 of my hard earned 100% return in 8 long months of investing.        I’m going to hold until Cohen takes game stop to the levels we know it can reach.        Also because these  🤌🏻 won’t let go of this baby rocket, papa Elon hasn’t even installed the electric jets to the rocket yet.       Think, right now majority of games are sold/downloaded through Microsoft and Sony. Correct me if I’m wrong and there’s actually a 3rd party distributor (other than the publisher of course).   Now imagine these following possibilities   1) Downloaded games on hard drives can be saved and redistributed.                 A)You trade in your old Xbox or old play station. You can wipe the hard drives of personal data while saving game data... set new serial numbers to the data so it can be redownloaded and distributed to hard drives for future play/backwards comparability.                B) this comes with the possibility of game stop exclusive releases of new consoles with pre loaded hard drives that contain used games they’ve purchased off older hard drives.   2) game stop takes a more aggressive stance on the  competitive game scene with in person tournaments.                 A) possible partnership with twitch/other streaming services. This could happen sooner rather than later because multiple game stop locations could have large tournaments with retail locations around the world.                 B) with possible twitch partnerships this could bring revenue for more twitch steamer merchandise being moved in retail locations.    3) Sec finds shares of GME are in none existence and they fuck us over and claim x amount of “fake” stock will be reclaimed (maybe at face value) from the most recent x purchases.                 A) I’m holding onto what I got until the end, because a funny feeling tells me as this all plays out we might see some wild shit to say the least.                  B) until everything settles with the suits and the many lawsuits I’ll be holding my shares. Although if it drops below $30 I am eating it up, no crumbs left behind.                                          Summary                 I’m in no way a financial advisor, this is not investment advice. I truly like the stock and I believe with the growing possibilities for future e-game distribution and multiple innovative minds at the helm of GameStop, this train can turn around and bring us back to the     .   TLDR: I’m holding because it’s not a loss until you sell, and these  🤌🏻 are better than your grandmas spaghett.

Is this still working?
I bought 4 shares yesterday, even though I was "warned" beforehand, what is that all about, how can they tell US what to do and what not to do while every one of them rich ass bastards do ANYTHING they want, hedge fund managers making 50 MILLION a year?? WTF.   I think we should do this to more than one stock, really shake shit up. Double up on all the stocks that are consistently "shorted" for gain. I use Fidelity and I can still buy shares, should I buy more? I mean what's the deal in a nutshell?

As a new comer to the WSB world who ACTUALLY is looking to learn, I just wanna say...
You know, a big part of this a lot of you WSB “OGs” need to realize is your responses to a shit ton of new people (some definitely bots and some DEFINITELY NOT) really adds to the negative side of this psychological battle. I get that you have a particular lingo you use and a way you go about passing on certain information. AND I GET THAT THERE ARE BOTS, WHAT PLATFORM DOESNT HAVE THEM! But a lot of REAL people may be getting discouraged solely based off the fact that the people they would ACTUALLY FUCKING LISTEN TO ON HERE are just gonna insult them because of their lack of knowledge, whether it be stocks or the culture of this subreddit. Like I said, I’m new to this community, but I’ve been studying and investing for the past 3 years and I came here to join this cause but also to LEARN more than anything. And hopefully get tendies.   End rant.
Primo Victoria my Noble Diamond Hands! I am Now in It to the Bitter End!
Stock is volatile! I’m losing money! SHUT UP!!!!
Stop panicking you paper handed bitch! You agreed to diamond hands. You agreed you would hold to the moon!   Plenty of people have seen the ridiculous amount of manipulation and FUD going on. Ladder attacks keep driving the price down. How do we know it’s a ladder attack? Look at the volume of trades. Look at the amount of shares being traded one after another.      100 shares. 100 shares. 100 shares. One after the other.   Everyone was all in on the movement. Now you see these posts saying how they were lied to. How they are losing money. First off, you heard it before, YOU DON’T LOSE ANYTHING (or gain anything) UNTIL YOU SELL YOUR POSITIONS. Second, movements and change takes time. Think about how long it took for women’s rights. Gay marriage. You wife to have a bf, and that be ok. This is a revolution! Washington lost more battles than he won, but he won the most important!!!!  People in power don’t like losing. But we can do this. The day will come when the HF need to buy back shares. It costs nothing to hold. It costs money to sell. Will there be some crazy conspiracies? I’m sure there will be.   If you don’t have any money in savings. You shouldn’t be buying. If you can’t stand volatility. You shouldn’t be buying. If you are easily manipulated. You shouldn’t be buying.   Now, if you’re asking if it is a good time to buy, read the above. Dig deep and really be honest with yourself. BUT, if you already bought, just HODL!!!   You are not alone. Deep down, many of us are nervous, but are riding it out anyway. Nobody likes to lose money, but IT TAKES MONEY TO MAKE MONEY!!   I’ve dropped $15k so far. Plan on another $5k after this post. That’s not much for some, and more than ever seen for others. I’ve done my soul searching and have come to terms with the fact that if I lose it all, I am ok with that.    It’s not about how many shares you have. It’s not about making money. It is all about the point. It’s about beating the HFs at their own game. It’s about writing our names in the history books. I will die on this hill. When historians look back to find out why, they will see these Diamond Fucking Hands clenching my $GME shares.    Be realistic though. GameStop should not be going bankrupt anytime soon. Look at the moves they are making!!! They just made some huge new hires to propel them forward!    I know you can do it. Times are tough and uncertain. One thing I am certain of though, APES TOGETHER STRONK!!!!!  Now the only question is “Can you dig it?  Can you dig it? CAAANNNNNN YOUUUUUU DIGGG IIIIIITTTTTTTT!!!!!!!”      (This is not financial advice. Am retard. Lead paint is delicious.)
Hold people hold!

Lovlely Synchronicity
From a pure asthetics point of view that really does look nice.
So, I have a bit of a retarded conspiracy theory that I am testing today.
As soon as I wake up every morning, I usually light my Mulled Cider scented desk candle and start delving into the stocks.   GME and AMC have been doing shit for the past few days. I haven't lit my candle in the past few days because I forgot to. I noticed this, so I lit it up this morning at about 8:45, but blew it out at 10 when I went to the gym. The stocks spiked this morning up until I left for the gym.   I'm home now, and the candle is once again lit. If the stocks reach higher highs than normal today, I will go out and buy an assload of these candles.   Yesterday was a huge test of ball size. Let's get those tendies.
Apple the EV Car company - A bull case for $300+ a share
Apple is now an EV car company!!                 As you may have heard Apple is in talks with Kia to build an Apple car by 2024.   The mobility market is a $10 trillion dollar market while phones are a $500 billion dollar market.   Apple has about one-third of the phone market.  So Apple would only need a 2% share of the mobility market to be the size of their iPhone business.    And we all know that people are going to lining outside those apple stores to get their apple car when it comes out.  I am sure apple will take a huge chunk out of the car market.  And the value of apple will def double.  It is not going to be Kia that will making most of the money.  It is going to be Apple                Also, apple has other markets they could easily enter and make money in such as search engine, TV's  that double as game console, voice assistant with automation tasks (siri), etc..  Disclosure I have bought 100k worth of apple stock at 136.
May be a retard but  🙏, adding to my position. I really like this stonk at this price.
T212 with this shit again.
Whyyyyy GME ???? Let’s make one of these, the leader of the Wolf pack.
I get it, we all love GME and we have had a lot of fun and sadness over the run up and run down.  But like Dodgecoin it’s value is guaranteed to drop, making more and more bagholders.  I mean it’s share value should be around fifty.  Cool. Let’s let it grow and save it when it’s hurting or close to bankruptcy. I mean it’s our stock!! However A company like BB has unlimited potential because they are moving into the cyber security industry and has a lot of room to adequately grow. It’s way undervalued. A underdog some would say. I think we can save them all.  AMC, Nokia, GME and Nok.  Our   let’s make BB our front runner, the leader of the Wolf Pack.🐺

GME hiring a Director, Digital Marketing & Sr. Solutions Architect
I own 6 shares of GME at around $280\~ but I truly believe in the long-term value and potential in this company and market, and these job postings give us a little more insight:        The Sr. Solutions Architect has been posted since 1/17 but the Director of Digital Marketing was just posted on 2/1 but this is definitely a good sign of things to come for GME.  There are some good insights into their strategy in the job descriptions:    Director of Digital Marketing       Providing direct supervision to a team of 2-4 individual contributors and consultants, this position will be responsible to direct and manage relationships with paid search agencies and affiliate platform and partners to develop, implement, track and optimize GameStop’s digital marketing   across all digital channels to achieve profitable     omnichannel sales growth   .     Building Strategic Partnerships   —  identifies opportunities and acts to build strategic relationships between one’s area and other areas, teams, departments, units, or organizations to help achieve business goals.     Sr. Solutions Architect       Assist with the development of GameStop intellectual property; frameworks, accelerators etc. Including creation of Solution Architecture processes, templates, reporting and governance framework     Assist Enterprise Architects with the development of application and information roadmaps for achieving the defined future state architecture   Now this is just the beginning of their Digital Transformation and I work for a Digital Intelligence Marketing Software company and often times eCommerce and digital customer acquisition strategies come from Digital Marketing departments. It will be interesting to see what other positions they start adding over the coming months but this is definitely a positive.

Something for everyone to think about if you're holding GME or thinking of it
Why are you holding this stock?  Is it for a quick buck? Well, realize that's probably behind us now. Is it to 'stick it to the man'? The man's making more money off this than you.  I bought into GameStop because of Ryan Cohen. Remember him? He founded Chewy, now a company with a 44 billion market cap.   Ryan Cohen is creating a leadership to take on the big boys in e-commerce.  And this isn't pet shit. This is video games. The video game market has $$ potential waay beyond what pet supplies do.   When GameStop has a Merket cap the same as Chewy that's going to be about $900/share!!!!  It could take a year or two. But that is a thousand percent gain over the next couple of years if you hold.   All this, and the shorts still haven't covered.   TL;DR GameStop going to be worth trillions, hold for a year or two and win big time!!
Just zoom out and the charts are still impressive!

Alright boys time for a life lesson.
Learn when to sell.   I'm relatively new. Joined WSB in August 2020, with my old account which was recently permaband for calling mods homosexuals. (I love you mods)  Anyways, I was excited. Watching all the gain porn made my dick hard and made me think I could one day make a big fat return like the rest of the veteran retards. My mexican ass dreamt about getting some nice USD tendies.  But as you may see, mistakes were made. I trusted Elon to announce a fucking million mile battery or some shit and went all in on TSLA calls for Battery Day (Sept. 22)     After that glorious loss, I took a brake, from September all the way through December. Still with my 99% loss, I didn't give up. My inner degenerate gambler didn't die that day, so I pushed through. I took my weak ass 300 dollar paycheck and put it in Robinhood. I heard some dude talking about having a nice deep fucking value investing opportunity in mind, hypothesizing  about some apparent short squeeze going on with GME, and some new dude that knew a thing or two about e-commerce and dog food. Reading the glorious DD got some light in my smooth brain, and went all in on January OTM calls, because I liked the stock and made my own decision to buy.  They started printing, and I kept buying, like the good retard I am.        As you may know, this shit kept going up, and the more it went up, the more calls and shares I bought, until I ended up at this point.        So, staring at my screen at a 50 bagger, September 2020 came into my mind like a war flashback, and guess what I did? I sold. I knew what holding bags felt like, and I promised I would never go through that shit again. If I hadn't sold I'd say that would have been the end of my gambling career, but it went well in the end.  Learning the lesson hurts like a motherfucker, but don't lose hope, as long as we have a market and we have access to options, you'll always have a chance to come back, maybe not with GME, as that was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but a chance will come, and you'll be ready.  TL:DR DON'T GIVE UP, BUT LEARN WHEN TO SELL  Edit: I’d like my “🗿MANOS DE PIEDRA🗿” flair, I think I deserve it.

Protip For The Newbs Who Bought High But Are Still Staying...
What is averaging down?   Example: You buy 10 shares at $350.  It tanks to double digits.  How do you fix this?    By buying 10 shares at, for example, ~$50 or so.  This is averaging down.  Suddenly, your $350 average cost drops to $200.  With 20 more shares after that at $50 (40 shares total), average cost drops to $125.  (Price doesn't have to be exact but you get the idea).      So basically, you're lowering your break-even point by that much, while raising your profit potential with more shares!     What's the downside?     You're also adding money to this position, so only do this if you're absolutely sure it'll go back up to your break-even point at least.  Don't do this just to chase losses.     Why bother with this, considering you're risking even more money?   Seeing a $350+ average cost while the underlying stays below $100 will most likely fuck with your mind (and that's not factoring in corporate-controlled news trying to manipulate you as well). The more emotional you get, the more likely you'll make mistakes.  It all depends on whether you're willing to throw in some more money to help stick to your convictions and clear your head.  And after spending $3500, what's $500 more to cut your break-even point almost in half?   How can I avoid getting into this mess in the first place?   Don't go all-in so soon.  Even only going in half makes a world of difference when you can spend the remaining half buying ~3x more shares at ~1/4 of the price (yes, at this point, you'd be all-in anyway, but at least you'd be doing so at a much lower price).  Just takes a bit of patience.  Either way, sooner or later, you mostly likely will have to hold, which is why mastering this is important.  Disclaimer: Not financial advice, do your own research, etc.
There is still hope! Research backed by data on new attacks!
I mean... I may like the stock a bit too much.

Confused why some are I’m doubt
If you’re in here posting that the squeeze is over and it’s stupid to hold you clearly didn’t understand the pretense to this entire concept. Not sure why you would put money into something like this you aren’t willing to completely risk to zero.   The concept is simple, outlast the willingness of the parties with short positions to hold and pay interest on the short position. If you need the money or have a weak stomach then you’re not retarded, you’re a real life idiot.   If the squeeze is really over then any autist knows that’s fine. It was a calculated risk and any money lost is just going to be written off as a loss to offset gains. If it ends up popping when least expected (that’s when it happens because any large position wouldn’t show you their hand willingly) then that’s why you held and had your limit set.   Say it with me: DUUUUUHHHHH DERP DUUUHH.

Australian crayon-eater reporting for duty. It's not much, but apes stronk together.
For those saying “they bought shorts at 400, it’s over” here’s some basic math for you
They shorted (about 115mil) 130% at (let’s say) $30    Now they “doubled down” and shorted at $400, I don’t know the actual number (does anyone?)    So let’s just say that the stock is now at $100   That means they’ll make $300 on the $400 stock and -$70 on the $30 short. For a total of $230 profit.    Easy to understand so far? Well guess what? I haven’t even begun to factor INTEREST into this,  and I honestly can’t. My 🧠 is too smooth. I just want you to know the facts as they are. Shorts are not gone and shorting more does not ERASE what is already shorted.    Oh and one more thing. They need your   Otherwise we enter into the FTD territory        🤲
The reality of GME and shooting up in price
If you're looking for it to hit 400+ again by tomorrow, the chances are probably slim. We're getting some positive spikes in price each day which is a good sign that there's enough of us holding ATM, but if we sell out now we lose. "HOLD THE LINE" at this point is just a meme that most people are using to drive the price up for small gains, but if we actually buy and hold, maybe in a week's time it'll follow the VW chart and sky rocket. Who knows. We pay a risky game, but it's a lot less risky if you don't half arse it. Don't sell out of fear, sell when you're happy with the price. Buy the dips and fight back against stock shorters when they come back on Monday.  If you want actual serious profit, we need everyone to hold. Half isn't enough to do what we want. As much as Hold the line is a meme, we've actually gotta do it for the long haul.   I've never owned any money im no financial adviser
What is GME market cap? It depends.
I wrote a script to notify me on NYSE trade halts on GME
I didn't want to spend my entire workday just monitoring the stock price, so I wrote a script that alerts me if GME is halted on the NYSE, so I can go and take a look at the takeoff   . (not that I would ever sell   , I like the stock)  The script checks the NYSE trade halts page (it uses the same API as your web browser would use), and if there is a halt in the matched tickers, it queries the current price from Yahoo Finance (don't murder me for my dirty code, yfinance uses pandas, which I'm not that familiar with)  The instructions are in the script, it works for me on Ubuntu in Python   If you want it to work on Windows/Mac, or want a different notification mechanism, rewrite the send_notification function.     Oh, this is not financial advice, I just like the stock.

Volatility Trend GME/AMC
Bear in mind folks there could be potentially millions of other people (probably alot smarter than us) who are not part of WSB playing a different game on these stocks. The last few days had a sharp rise and then   could be due to alot of people scalping ... short trades (buying in low, riding the trend upwards on the back of you fucktards buying in the morning) in the morning then selling off as it starts to trail off) .... markets with such a high volatility are a perfect money maker for scalping... not saying thats what it could be or what you should   it could very well be a reason for a rise then trail off. Be vigilant and use your head
TD Ameritrade messing with ACH transfers?
I completed a transfer from my bank to my TD Ameritrade Acct on Monday, it was confirmed and I used the funds to buy. Yesterday got a margin call, saying they may sell my positions to cover and notification that my bank rejected the transfer.  Funds are still gone from my bank and they said that they did not reject anything, it shows as a completed transfer on their end.  not sure what's going on here, any idea what I can do to look into this?
Game Stop should build the world’s most dominant esports league
Professional basketball started in the US in 1898. It wasn’t until 1949 that the National Basketball Association was founded.  GME doesn’t have to be the first major esports league, but if they could become the dominant one, that would be decades of huge growth potential.  They already have 5,509 stores that could operate as in person district tournament locations which is a big advantage compared to most leagues that don’t have the resources to lease thousands of locations across the country.  GME could do it for essentially free as they already have the locations and gaming equipment needed in each store. Also, GME now has a meme culture halo thanks to WSB.  Expanding into this arena could generate tons of positive press because it reverses the narrative they are in a growth dilemma. Esports is consistently growing YoY and could be worth tons of money for decades if they can start and then own the dominant esports league.
Donut miss out on OCUGEN
They recently got the contract to bring COVAXIN to the US Market. This means as soon as it gets the FDA approval we will see a Vertical movement like Pfizer or BIONTECH in October.   No financial advise tho
Stop talking about a squeeze.
Talk about how fun it is to hold, because if big money watches monkeys, they learn monkey thought, monkey no learn big money, because big money not public forum.   monkey shout “squeeze!!” big money hide 1 week, they no eat, but safer than monkey, wait for ape to shhhh, then peek again, and monkey repeat.   Monkey party, big money no know monkey thought, just know monkey party, try to join monkey, monkey no allow; monkey wait, monkey squeeze. monkey win.    not banana advice.

GME 09/02 Short Interest
If you guys wanted to dump your shares on Tuesday if the SI is low, you should read this article it might help explain why SI isn’t the end game for us, also I’m waiting for the FTD (failure to deliver) numbers this month. I see a lot of comments saying they will sell if SI is low on Tuesday this would give the    exactly what they want.      TL;DR - HOLD past Tuesday, SEC sick my ape dick, Janet Yellen do your fucking job you work for the people stop taking bribes from a bunch of useless
The might all in!
Lately I've been having fun doing all ins with around 10k, but I need to stop it before I start losing money. I'm just curious to see how many of you freaks diversify your portfolio and how many go all in on something when you "know" things are going up?     EDIT: "mighty" should be the title...
Thanks for the dip, was able to even out my buy-ins at 340    Now I've got 18 @ avg. of $165, wish I could do more! Take us to the moooooon!
Why Rite Aid is RAD not BAD
Hello retards.  I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in    RITE AID (RAD)    Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robinhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20   reverse stock split   artificially X 20 the price.   WHAT DOES THIS MEAN   It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.  Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.   PROMISING NUMBERS      For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to 10 billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.      WHAT DO I DO    I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.    I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It  should  be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.  And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.  2/19@25 4/16@30
GME/AMC Peak and Reverse at same exact times today
They are covering shorts.
I think we'll see a few spikes like this as they won't cover the shorts all at once. One bounce then let the momentum fizzle & then spam this reddit with a bunch of negative sentiment. Lather, rinse, repeat     But it doesn't matter cuz we just like the stonk.
It’s not much but it’s all I can spare    GME TO THE MOON
They really out here saying teens are buying GME worrying their parents 😭
Blackberry is a hidden   Not a short, just an extremely undervalued company for it being in tech security and EV   is just the beginning.
Bought back into GME in early morning at $66 a share. We just experienced the gamma squeeze on the downside as puts became more in the money. If we reverse momentum there’s no reason we can’t get an upside gamma squeeze next week
Most of my money is in positions I didn’t want to unwind so it’s only 38 shares, but I’m back onboard!  38   = $2545. So I barely qualified for yolo flair, I’ll take it  Also wtf they halted it again to the upside after it hits $80? They really are terrified of a round 2. Where we’re all the halts when it was getting cut in half for 3 days straight
Lol doesn’t anyone here realize that instructing people to switch brokerages so gme’s volume can go up and help drive up the price is still considered market manipulation? Like i know this sub is full of retards.. but are you DUMB? 🤡
If you get a random call its the sec. they on your ass. Also obligatory   emoji.  Edit: apparently I wasn’t specific enough. There’s nothing wrong with helping a fellow retard buy up more GME. Just remember to watch the context. Because that context is the only thing between us getting labeled as manipulators when we’re really here drawing tendies with crayons.

The GME investor relations intern this morning
Robinhood sucks but they’re not the only ones that need to get whipped into shape. Clearing houses need to be fixed to avoid the systematic fucking of retail investors in the future.
All the focus is on RH, and they deserve it, but we’d be missing a major part of this issue if we didn’t also look at the clearing houses.   1. Why suspend all buying instead of just buying on margin? 2. Why the fuck do we still have a 3 day settlement period (T+2)? It’s a remnant of the days of delivering physical stock certificates. This is incredibly retarded to keep around.  3. Did the clearing houses collude with hedge funds?  4. Did the clearing houses change their liquidity requirements for the meme stocks? Or did their algorithms necessitate the restriction without a change? 5. How the fuck is limiting demand suppose to help people? Does anyone at the clearing houses and brokerages remember high school economics?
MEDIA CONFIRMS ROBINHOOD WAS USED AND IS BEING USED TO DIRECTLY MANIPULATE THE MARKET. This is very serious and must be investigated SEC.

Could we end up controlling GME?
If apes keep on holding shares and buying dips, is there a chance we end up gaining a controlling interest of GME?  Let's say half of the members on this sub use their new stimulus cheques to buy GME at current levels, that would be enough to own GME entirely at current share price...  Considering there is already a considerable amount of the float that is owned by members of this sub, I think we realistically have a path to owning   of the shares in circulation by eoy.  If that were to happen, I would legitimately become more bullish about the business. With Cohen and a gang of millenial degenerates in charge of a company in the gaming industry, sky is the limit...  Disclosure : I own only 1 GME share bought close to ATH purely to support the movement, I was not really bullish on the business until after the squeeze.
I already own a lot of AMC but can’t pass up $  a share. Holding and buying.
I made a meme....

Fuck it I doubled down.

Women's health investments.
Hi Retards,  I have been looking at companies that focus on women's health. I believe that they can have a big year, or multiple years, under Joe Biden's presidency. I came across DARE the other day and would like to hear what you have to say.    DARE    February 6th, 2020, DARE Bioscience was announced as the leader in women's health innovation. Having successfully accomplished positive topline results from DARE-BVFREE, a Phase 3 Trial of DARE-BV1 in Patients Diagnosed with genital bacterias. Currently, Dare is waiting for approval from the FDA for their primary drug, which is looking positive.  Source:     Thoughts?

If you really want to fuck the hedge funds, you will close your RH account today. Otherwise they will become billionaires because of you
There is billions invested in RH right now by the same hedge funds that FUCKED every one of us. They expect to make billions more after RH IPOs.  If you really want get back at them, you will close your RH today. Otherwise, RH will happily IPO in the next few weeks/months, and then that douchebag CEO will be a billionaire, and they will be laughing at you for helping them succeed while we all lost money.  CLOSE YOUR RH ACCOUNT TODAY.
You apes are retarded, it'll never go back up, face it you lost....
Said the retards to me and everyone else yesterday.  Well, you paper handed bitches, bet you're regretting selling huh?  Market opened at $95, a far cry from yesterday's $53.  It's only going to go up from here.           🤑🤑🤑

We had a big flop, the hedge funds took the lead at the turn, but we're still waiting on the river Tuesday.  Yes, you have to know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em, and when to walk away and when to run, but remember the golden rule. Never count your money while you're sitting at the table.  In the words of George C Scott as General George S Patton, "Rommel, you beautiful bastard, I READ YOUR BOOK!"

"The company's cybersecurity services cover more than 96% of all online threats to enterprises. In fact, nine out of 10 of the world's largest banks utilize BlackBerry's security software. Blackberry also has a robust business segment dedicated to designing self-driving operating systems and vehicle software. As many as 19 out of 25 electric vehicle manufacturers, representing approximately 61% of market share, use BlackBerry's services. Over 175 million vehicles worldwide also have the company's operating software installed.  It should be no surprise that BlackBerry's services have a consumer retention rate of 90%. It brings in about $224 million in revenue per quarter and is breaking even. In its last fiscal year (ended March 30, 2020), the company increased its software sales by 26% compared to fiscal 2019.  The tech firm is well poised to take off, given the current craze for electric vehicles and the need for companies to upgrade their cyber defenses as working online becomes the norm. Since last January, BlackBerry has more than doubled investors' money. It was a temporary target of investor attention last week, along with other much shorted stocks, experiencing a short-sequeeze. However, BlackBerry remains a long term buy due to its outstanding performance in the cybersecurity and vehicle automation fields."

Do you guys know if we can buy GME or AMC yet on Etrade? Thank you fellow retards  Edit: thank you apes they are trading and I bought 2 stocks 🤚  I appreciate it brethren
It’s not about a “SECOND SQUEEZE”, it’s about finishing a squeeze that was illegally halted.
I feel like this better explains the moral behind GME rn.
They’re learning about us in schools and how we made history 🥲
Frank tried to off himself when the bottom dropped out, but his neck is just so damned thick. I think he's just gonna swing there.

Hold up, gotta refuel real quick
SNDL
Was this just a hyped-up stock or do you actually believe in it?     I personally believe in it. With them now restructuring their business to fit the needs of a bigger market. Also, they settled their debts. Not advertising so I don't want to be flagged. Just curious if any of those were the initial drive or if the short was.

Hold the line. But more importantly I think what’s important to remember is to not lose this fire. Don’t let them win by via monopolizing manipulation for the ultra rich.

Not just a get rich quick bet, but countering wall streets arrogance through sheer cooperation of the most retarded genius’ on earth. TO THA MOON DONT BE A PUSSY

“Ladder attacks” and the squeeze
Im new, like most here. What is stopping the HF from doing these ladder attacks(price goes down) and closing short positions(price goes up) and then just doing more ladder attacks to bring it back down. Keeping it in the 55-90 range and never spiking out of control?
What in the fuck is this? Am I in the right reality?
They don't want to see ANYONE buying or holding, whether they are bots or salty old paperhands. IGNORE THE NEGATVITY
Stocks go down?
How many people have you had to explain that stocks can go up or down? Whereas the dollar only goes down.  Bought 10 shares of carnival today   Holding 20 shares of gme @105  Edit: not financial advice.

IN W/ 7 GME @ $69, I'M DOING MY PART

Some advice to make GME holders have an easier time with this.
Go into your brokerage account, put in a sell order for all your GME at $1,000 per share. Walk away from the screen. One day while you are taking a nap on your hammock you will get a notification on your phone that your order was executed. You will crack a small grin, and go back to sleep.
Shut the fuck up    🤚   and beyond!
WSB is not what it once was. Propaganda being pushed against the over all consensus. We need a new platform!
Time for a new platform folks something that is not able to be infiltrated and people behind the creation of it have some moral standards and backbone.
What are the consequences for a Failure to Deliver?
ive looked online for the last few days after all the talk around here about Melvin stacking up their FUDs at what point MUST they cover these? can they be taken to court over this? Everywhere I've tried reading about this subject only explains what a FUD is but not what actually happens after.   20 shares, holding!  Edit: meant FTD and not FUD, both of these acronyms have been floating around this subreddit for the last few days and I got them mixed up.
At a   loss on $GME while the stock is at a nice $69.
Maybe today Satan? Idk, selling my soul before selling these shares.
It’s a sign!

-200iq Move... How I killed the squeeze.
Last week I bought in at the high so that I didn't miss the flight to the moon. This morning seeing the gains pouring in I knew deep down in my soul it was time to double down and buy more shares I even placed a limit order above the market number thinking this 200iq move would confirm I do not miss the flight (confirmed my autism at this moment). I can now confirm the market actively moves against any position I take... Diamond Hands planning my next buy in as long as I don't sell it's not a loss and I like this stock.
No trading platforms will let me sign up... I've been waiting for days
I tried Acorns, Robinhood and Webull. I've been waiting for days and days and they won't verify me. Are they trying to stop me from getting diamond hands?  Is there any platform that will let me trade? Is there a way I can make these platforms to add me?  Also I know I'm a noob and I'm not investing more than I can lose!
Everyone thinking of buying more GME I urge you to switch from robinhood asap.  🏽
When the price jumps from everyone buying again, their attempt to stop people from buying will be useless and we’ll get to the moon       🏽  🏽  this is not financial advice I eat crayons   12 @ $273
Any chance to get into stocks before turning 18?
Im a 16 yo from Europe and im pretty interested in the stock market. Are there any traiding apps I can already use? Or how likely is it that I could just give a fake age and they wouldn’t notice it in the identification process? Is there some other way I could interact with the market? It doesn’t even have to with real money, although it would be a lot more interesting. Just watching gets pretty boring over time.   Just so im not misunderstood. I know can loose money in the stock market and I probably will, but i still want to be in the game. And I’m also not just interested in stocks because of the recent GameStop thing, although I would have really liked to participate.

GameStop needs volume
You guys know what to do. We need way more volume in GameStop today. We're still 60 million almost over the outflow. If we have volume and we have people buying into this it's going to pump again

My Loss Porn
From what I understand it's a right of initiation. I had GME stocks at an average of 113. Lost most of it, 43% loss. Since I panic rebought during the spike only to lose it again I can't write it off on my taxes either, as I understand it.     I know it's not as much as some of ya'll but i'm a poor. This is 1/3 of all my money. At least we're getting the stimulus right? I gambled, and I lost. I shall accept the ritual humiliating.
I wanna ask soemthing
Who is here, hasnt bought shit, but are here for the memez and just enjoy whatever comes ahead? I know I am
APHRIA/TILRAY ! Short interest increasing. Fed legalization around the corner ? Thoughts?
Are we still expecting anything to come out of AMC? I was under the impression that come February 9th the price of increase because of some report
MY FELLOW APES , The good mods are back and order is restored, so naturally my dipshit unwiped ass bought 2 more shares which will in turn add to my 2 existing shares to make 8 shares of GME and allow me to buy 800 more packages of crayons to indulge in   🖍

SOMETHING BESIDES GME - HOW BOUT FREE APHA MONEY
Does everyone realize APHA has bought out TLRY?   Once the deal closes, every APHA share will convert to   shares of TLRY   I'm no mathmagician but TLRY is at 27 and APHA is at     Implied value of APHA is 22 so there's a free   return sitting right there in front of us   Fellow tards, why are we not picking up this freebie?

Retards, Listen Up. I Went Full Autist and This Is The Result: Arbitrage DD for  's.
Feel free to check out my post history if you want to read more about the details as I am going to try to keep this broad and simple for the apes, autists, and retards.    Guys hear me the fuck out. Aphria and Tilray are merging to form the  largest cannabis company in the fucking world.  Aphria ($APHA) is buying ($TLRY), but the new company will move under the $TLRY name. I know what you're thinking "ok.  's like TLRY.  's buy TLRY." No.  's buy $APHA which is literally a discounted ticket the Tilray show.   Prices   right now   $  for $APHA and $  for TLRY. after you've locked in a cost basis for   APHA   the price of the stock does not matter. The price of APHA could be $1/share or up to $20/share and it  wouldn't even fucking matter.  All that matters is your cost basis and TLRY price, and heres why.   Regardless of where APHA is in April/May, your stock after the merger will be .8381 of whatever TLRY is trading at. So you give 2 shits about APHA price, and as long as TLRY stays above your cost basis plus 17% or if it rises to a point where the conversion makes the shares worth less (even if that happened, congrats because we went from ~$17 up to $20-$22 range depending), you're going to profit. Let's look at some numbers.   10 shares APHA $    MERGER happens   10 shares x .8381 (  = $     This is called arbitrage and it's slipping away right in front of your face. Once APHA rises to TLRY and closes the gap, you lose the opportunity to lock in a low cost basis that will rise by 30+% on merger.   $APHA        $TLRY        Not financial advice, I eat crayons and stuff or whatever we're saying now. I basically just use this place as a good distraction not to stare at my portfolio second by second.  Positions: LONG APHA/TLRY, CGC, CRON, MSOS
Buying pressure
Buying 1 stock 10 times has more effect than buying 10 stocks in 1 shot because it creates upwards pressure.  So do not yolo all your money at once but buy every now and then, you will contribute more to the stocks price growth and possibly save money in the event of a dip.
300 -> 900 -> 2k -> 0
Listen up, retards!
I have done some super heavy legit math with numbers and shit and at this point there is only one possibility:  The hedgies played the stock price so much that at this point no one trully knows how much a share actually costs, but I estimated using complicated real math and the outcome is:  WE SECRETLY OWN THREE TIMES THE MONEY IN THE GALAXY AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO GET TO ANOTHER GALAXY! TO ANDROMEDA!                 This is not financial advice. I just like the stock.
I’ll never sell! It’s either my ticket to a small fortune, or a bit of a lesson. Either way I’m holding the line! No point in pulling out now..
CHA CHA CHA CHA CHING!
Buy MGM. Hold and buy MGM
I have had 300 shares of MGM since it was $12 a share. Next week they are announcing earning. I love here in Vegas and the company is doing excellent. Earning will take it past $40 towards a future split. Get in now! Buy and hold!

Question about options trading on Robinhood (I know, I'm changing brokers soon)
I might have fucked up royally here. I've been "flipping" options contracts ie: buying them on the market and selling them without exercising them. Thankfully I haven't done this too many times, but my question is still relevant. Basically, if I'm understanding correctly, I can sell to close or sell to open an option. When I sell an option on Robinhood, am I selling back to the market and thus not retaining any obligation to make good on the contract to the next buyer, or do I retain the obligation should that contract be exercised?  If it's the latter, is there a way to check my obligations somewhere? Essentially I'm scared that I'm now bound to the contracts that I sold and will be absolutely raked across the coals once they're exercised. I know I've been stupid, I've only dabbled in options to learn them, and this might be a very valuable lesson.
So is AMC dead?
is it GME or bust for you guys?

Note that it has broken through, however we are no means out of the woods! Just keep the head and play responsibly

Feels good, anyone else doing this today?
Sayonara, Robinhood.
[showerthought] They are one step ahead of us
They (you know who) know that our next move is to buy and hold the stock. I think that they organize their strategy accordingly. We don't know anything about their next move. What do you think?
It's like a heartbeat, which means this stock is still alive. Only thing we can do now is resuscitate it.

Long time lurker   thought I’d drop in and give my unpopular opinion to those of you who don’t wanna hear it.  I’ve seen a lot of users on this subreddit get very upset with the fact that some of us aren’t willing to “hold the line” and help you “go to the moon”  are we fuckin 5 years old??  Calling each other “retards” and using cliche emojis and stupid phrases like “GME stocks go Brrrrr” (one of the cringiest things I’ve ever heard btw) is seriously hurting whatever cause you’re trying to fight. I’m all for supporting the little   I AM one of the little guys, but I feel really bad for those of you who got roped into the whole “meme” aspect of this whole Wall Street shake   was our chance to make some serious money while sticking it to the Fat Cats but instead, the more vocal members of this subreddit decided to turn it into their own little circus act. Fuck your diamond hands and your ape grip or whatever you children say on   it’s time to grow up a little bit so that the next time you have the 1% shitting their pants, you don’t go off and ruin it with your embarrassing rhetoric.   And for those of you on here actually looking to make some money, stay strong folks, there are always going to be good days and bad days make today a good day.

DKNG Super Bowl
Let me start off by saying that I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am a retard and don’t know what I’m talking about I just like the stock.   DKNG saw an almost 50% jump in stock price last Super Bowl comparing The Friday before to the Monday after. Currently more states than ever are allowed to gamble online and the stock price has been on a steady increase all year. Obviously with Super Bowl this weekend today’s last day to get in on all the calls/stocks before this thing takes off!   DKNG to the moon!         Feb 12 $65c / Feb 12 $70c

THIS TYPE OF ENERGY WE NEED - I'm tired of the doomer shit over the last few days, keep the energy up.
I'm sure everyone felt down yesterday, pun intended, but today's start is refreshing - even if it's just temporary. This week has been rough, but, I thought this was what WSB was about - keep the memes coming. Godspeed fellow Apes, we're hand-in-hand riding this together.
Most Meaningful YOLO of My Life GME
Watching the prices rise on Robinchode app even though I hold most shares on Fidelity gives me a sick satisfaction

Robinhood account went from $100 to $
Put $100 bucks in RH to invest in GME but the day it became available they shut down the market for those stocks. Well I tried to withdraw the cash and couldn’t so I went for a transfer of assists (I know mistake) to my fidelity account. Well that worked for my stock in RH but not the cash. It sat in RH for days as buying power and not withdraw-able  cash. Then finally it hit so I tried and boom account deactivated. Try as I might contacting RH activating my account. I couldn’t gain access to that money. No buying stocks no transferring just shit out. Then today I open it and it’s at zero. Feels like they stole a $100 bucks from just for trying to use heir application. Any advice?
Paccar DD - Cathie Wood likes it ... A LOT!
So I've been noticing in the daily emails from ARK that Cathie has been buying a lot of Paccar (PCAR) and I think that people are finally starting to notice since it popped like 4% yesterday and Seeking Alpha mentioned it.  They have been working hard on EV Semi Trucks and Autonomous Driving tech and for those that don't know, Paccar is the Fortune 500 parent company of brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt.  So one of the largest (if not largest) semi truck manufacturers in the world ...  It's up to 1% of the ARKK fund now and that's really all the DD I need. Cathie's been buying a stodgy old company that no one cares about? Oh wait, they are actually making autonomous EV semis and have the production capability to do so? Hmm.  How come no one has noticed this?        Positions: Just bought two LEAPS for 12/17 (furthest date) at $115
BB, AMC, GME - SPY
Why is BB and AMC following GME to a T? I mean I understand that theyre memestonkz but the short interest wasn't nearly the same across these 3 tickers and they didn't have the same scale of blowup either. Additionally they all seem to inverse SPY perfectly. I'd attach pictures of charts but I don't feel like screenshotting and I know none of you retards know what to make of a graph.  I was long on BB and AMC before this all went down and I'm watching GME drag em on the Rollercoaster and it made me very happy last week and big mad now, so what gives?
I finally found a chance to buy in, it's all I can afford at the moment but I like the stock, what else can I say

What’s with the despair around here?? Look at the data you  ! We have a ton of power! We hold a ton of shares and control over GameStops future! We still hold a ton of stock that shorter sellers want!
They keep telling us that we should not like the stock. But we do...
Vanguard preventing me from buying gme stocks
My available funds says $20,000. When I try to buy any gme stocks, vanguard says "this order cant be accepted because it would exceed your available balance". I have a couple screenshots. Anyone know whats going on?  Edit: it can take up to 7 days to clear your funds unless you wire transfer to your vanguard account, which i did not do. Even though I made the account a few days ago and my available funds says $20,000, it takes time to clear during where it uses my settlement fund, which says $0. Thanks everyone for the quick responses!!
GME today be like
We need big buyers
No offense to you all newbies buying a share and holding, but tbh it’s barely making a difference. We need some big buyers to keep moving these prices up

Alright you fucks.  Last week everyone was in NOK talking about the moon and now I see nobody.  So maybe it was a distraction.  Butttttttt now it's ON MAJOR DISCOUNT.

Fastest access to new public listings?
This has proven harder to Google than I'd hoped, so I'm turning to the smooth brain hivemind for insight.  For us retail traders who aren't wealthy enough to participate in the actual IPO process, what's the fastest way to get in on the action with new tickers? Are any of the common zero-commission brokerages faster to add new listings? Is the answer to this question just "Use Webull and get up at 4am?"
TRADE HALTS ARE NORMAL FFS
When the price swings too wildly up or down, trading is automatically halted. It doesn't mean the stock peaked, it doesn't mean the stock market is crashing. It DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO SELL.  Maybe it means your wife's boyfriend just made her orgasm, I'm not sure about that.  To repeat for the newbie retards in the back seats, TRADING HALTS ARE NORMAL.  I swear, if I see another comment in the dailies freaking out over this, I'm going to come over there and force feed you crayons until you figure this shit out.     btw I'm posting this as NEWS, because apparently that's what it is to you fucking apes.

Attn mods: the quality of content here has deteriorated since the GME blowup. Can we start swingin that ban hammer?
Attn mods: the quality of content here has deteriorated since the GME blowup. Can you start swinging the ban hammer?  I used to sort this sub by new, which was great for getting mostly shitty DD, but the occasional solid work of art. Now I search by new and it’s just a bunch of ape emojis, “ape strong”, diamond hands bullshit, and stupid fucking questions about what to invest in. This isn’t fucking r/investing or r/stocks. And good lord I can’t even tell you how many posts are talking about sub-5k losses. What is this, amateur hour?  How can we help you start banning these shitheads, is there a way for our community to help catch these posts quicker for you?  I wanna see the next analfarmer, a new GUH, and the next moron writing about how steel futures are the next google. Not some dork talking about how hes “holding the line” with the four shares of GME he bought at $280. So SUE ME!  Ps where my PLTR gang at?
Aphria (Apha) getting an uptick in short interest. I know you guys like to battle shorts so bring the fight to them.
Don't let the shorts win. Fight the Hedge Funds.
Can someone explain Robinhood’s level 2 market data to a smooth brained ape like me?
I’ve been watching level 2 market data on GameStop but my dumbass doesn’t even understand what I’m looking at. Can I get an explanation on what I’m looking at like I’m a 5 year old? I Mainly just don’t understand the graph. Oh and GME
I haven't 69'd this much since Bon Jovi
I lost 60k Yesterday gabling GME. These are going to be my long holds. Good luck brothers.
BB flying again
BB got the hammer right before hitting 30 last week, but it’s taking off again now. It’s been upgraded to ‘very strong buy’, ‘must buy’, and if you’ve been here awhile i know you’ve read the DD’s. If you’re looking to bolster your other gains with some sprinkles and a cherry on top, don’t forget about the original designated side dish of - BB      Their partnership with Amazon and Baidu got swept away in all the news, so you might have missed it, but I’m not a financial advisor and I have 1000 shares of BB, and bought 200 of it today   Do your own DD and research, i’m just spreading the good news for BB.
How fucking weird! They didn't mention the risk that your broker will shut down your ability to buy in order to protect their hedgies. Fuck Robinhood buy GME!     For life.
Can't tell if this is a promo or a warning
Eat my ass losers. On to fidelity, AMC  🙏 baby.
The rise was Mr. 200k with shares at 50$.
So was the dip.  He got out with $120,000 profit from people fomo his spike.

Not much, but I'm holding and buying. I started with 1 share 2 weeks ago, grew it to 11! Dont just HOLD, BUY!     4evr
Let’s all watch the Wallstreetbets Movie together when it comes out in AMC theatres

Do Hedgies really understand the power of weaponized autism?
I don't think they do. Otherwise they'd just surrender the financial battle, stop manipulating the market and cut their losses. Sun Tzu 101: Know yourself, know your enemy. When you are weak, pretend to be   you are strong, pretend to be weak. They failed to grasp  AT LEAST  one of those prerequisite strategic components for victory. I didn't invest more than I could lose. These stonks are just a lottery ticket for me, a keepsake- a mememto. Our diamond-palm deathgrip on these stonks is fueled by unyielding stubbornness and eternal spite. I, for one, intend for my great grandchildren to inherit these shares...  \ autistic screeching noises\   Edit to add: Even though my health now precludes it, I have been a lifelong student of combat sports (fencing, etc.) Not master, mind you- student. One thing I learned from every sort of conflict that I've been in, including simulated, is the power of calculated spite and apathy. When I see them manipulate, what I feel is  apathy  impelled by a rational and analytical sense of  spite . Emotion has nothing to do with it. It is a logical position. I don't care what they do, nor will I allow my actions to be affected by their actions. They have no control over me. They have no power over my decisions- nor will they frighten me and make me back away from what I have invested in. It's like they don't exist, but they sorta do.  I'm going to paraphrase/rephrase and possibly misattribute a concept taught by Tsunetomo ( Hagakure ) that explains the power of apathy:  "If a man cannot detach himself from life, he is of no use whatsoever. But through his detachment he can accomplish any feat. If he is able to live  as though his body were already dead, he has gained freedom. Dishonor will never find him; he will fulfill his duty without failing."  If you have only invested what you can afford to lose, then going forward they are powerless to stop the movement and our collective momentum. Detach yourself from the fear, uncertainty, doubt and desire to check up on them stonks. Whether the stonk goes up or down is irrelevant and    us , not for  them .     :)
HOLD and let it go up!
We made it reach 300 once and we can do it again!!   Not a financial advise

I don't know if anyone else is watching but I'm pretty excited that it looks like we could close above 75, anyone else wearing out their f5 keys?     \#edit: I'm an idiot, I accidently clipped the ticker symbol off the screenshot, it's GME, though I guess most gathered that by price        \#edit2: AMC's are pretty interesting too, might as well add it here

Now who wants my wife's phone number??
Alright you   🦧 retards, Robinhood's cap is GONE. WE NEED TO REINITIATE. ALREADY UP 20% TODAY. IF WE CAN GET IT GO UP JUST A LITTLE, THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR ONE MORE DOMINO EFFECT
Robinhood has billion dollar loans so they won't run out of money again, we've got to try to push this one more time.     isn't enough. We have to BUY!!  Currently in with all my very few savings at 10gme and I have no regrets.  #MAKE THEM PAY, LITERALLY

People who got left holding the bag with GME should sell and buy AMC
While I agree and believe GME shares are not worth more than $20 a share. GME had the fuel to reach $1000-10,000 a share because of the fundamentals of shorting. No sharers available to cover, Thus it was possible to sell your shares at orbital prices.   Now that WALL STREET was able to play dirty and take the fuel out of GME, I NO LONGER believe GME will reach those prices anymore. NOW the share price will behave like any other normal stock. As GME offers new services and a new business model, then the share price will rise proportionally to the value the company offers. THEREFORE, all those who bought $50-400 a share should sell or recover losses. I SUGGEST selling and jumping onto AMC  I believe AMC will not experience that  🌕 because is not as shorted as GME was. However, the average price as the country opens up should be $15-20 this year specially w vaccines being more effective, allowing you to recover from GME losses.   Also gives me confidence Blackrock double their ownership on AMC from 3 to 6%. I believe the current price of AMC is a bargain to double your money at this prices.   As sad as it makes me say it the Short squeeze is over and is GAME OVER for GameStop thanks to WALL STREET MANIPULATION! I feel sorry for those who suffered big losses thanks to the manipulation of Wall Street. Like I said I believe based on the short squeeze fundamentals, WITHOUT Wall Street FOUL PLAY , GME would’ve reached $1000
GME hit 95 an hour ago get in now before before it breaks 100!
Guys I’m so proud of you retarded apes. Come save my ass! Been holding the line since 150! HALP MEEE.  Also fuck the hedge funds and fuck the mass media and all their tricky bullshit. This experience has been eye-openeing to me for SURE.  Copied comment from below... Umm no it’s not look at the high sale price (not the average price) at 930CST! Why would I lie. You can verify yourself. Look first then respond. Not on Apple Stocks but on a trading platform. EDIT: it was   my bad
Any reason not to buy options at $  and sell them at $
So I recently bought a very low amount of very cheap options not expecting too much (again, I barely put any money into it), and they recently hit $  However, this morning, the stock went up a little bit (still not even close to the call's price target), but the call went up to $ , and it got me thinking. Basically is it at all a strategy to buy the lowest strike price $  call, then if the stock goes up a tiny bit it goes up to $  and you sell the option for 100% returns? (I should mention, I have no intent to exercise any of these, I would simply sell them). In addition, the call does appear to be able to be worth less than $ , so as long as you don't wait until expiration day, it won't be worthless or anything. Am I truly retarded and completely missed something or is this a valid strategy for stocks I think will be going up?      And yes I still have my GME, if you were wondering.

Don’t get overexcited, congrats on getting this far  🤝
Don’t get overexcited, you will be sad later, it still might take time. Train your brain, learn to react ice cold for prices swings, it will be useful for life. Stress is harmful, learn to minimize it using your brain. Remember these swings don’t matter, it’s manipulated, it’s not real, relax, it’s good for you. Emotions are traders’ worst enemy. Be like a machine. Be autistic.  EDIT: GME8@250 AMC60@15 basically third world country I live in

Stay Calm and HOLD if you are a   ️ ️
The stocks were being halted because of how fucking fast it shot up. That is game breaking fast gains. This is nothing out of the ordinary or market manipulation, this is a system that has been around for some time now and is automated. When a stock changes price insanely fast, it can trigger a circuit breaker which halts all transactions for a few moments. This is to ensure market stability and provide breathing room in the case of incredibly rapid market fluctuation.  What does this mean? It means that this stock is insanely volatile. You do not get that level of value fluctuation anywhere else in the market with as little of trading as was going on. What it means is   are holding and these   ️ ️ haven't let up, and it is still shaking up the stock. The game isn't over. Buys help, but right now the holds are the real key here. If you buy and cave in to the sell you only give them more ammunition and hinder the cause.  Source: I am monkey. This is not financial advice, and I am not an expert. Will work for 🥭🥭
Some ape from r/GME with serious DD
Posted by 📷    FINAL EDIT: Toning down the Rhetoric. We need real data, can this be mathed out? I like that guys idea of a shareholder meeting. GET THESE FUCKS IN JAIL. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.    ALLEGATION: SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL  Let's roleplay, retards. I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.  I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death. Here's my plan.  I collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME. This happens. I don't know how, but keep going with me.  So now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME shares out of my account, or the jig is up. They'd be caught as a FAIL TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one. So how do I never sell one of these? Shorting!  But no no guys... not just regular shorting. We... we would short. EVERY. TRANSACTION. EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY. It's more important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the market and get found out. Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of intercepting magic.  So, we do this for a while. Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a couple go. Well, let's wait and see what happens.  < INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME >    Oh, shit. Things are warming up. People think Gamestop might really come back. If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5 million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it from my account.  Oh, shit. It happened. A lot. Look at those fail to delivers. They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.  The jig is up.  I don't want to get caught, so I hit my "omfg algorithm" button, that will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of those buy orders for GME. I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.  They decided "FUCK IT" eventually, and traded in their   FAKE SHARES   for   REAL MONEY   at some point during this, and those are   FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS  . THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS,   SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.    THOSE ARE FAKE SHARES, "CREATED" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD HAVE COME IN FOR THEM. AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION   AND     ~~ITS NOT JUST~~     MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP. \[Edited, im retarded\]    ===========================================================  please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler  Their stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole portfolio. The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.     Imagine using your car jack while the handle is twisted open. No pressure, fluid is just movin around. Even in this state, sometimes if you pump it fast enough you can see little jumps of life. The real solution though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.  Visualize their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in which case it EXPLODES. We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k bids being filled right before everything shut down. But in this waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment they overshorted, and it remains. Its why they didnt bail at 20, or 80, or 115. THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME > FLOAT. This was the math all along.  This also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine this pool.    TLDR:   The mathematical strategy of the situation is to   reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)  , and   grow the maximum red force (additive).    We have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of red, quickly. If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE. IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.  Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally -   THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK  , and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT   AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL    This theory connects the dots.    Please if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read. Ive been trying via modmail, posts, everything. Anyone with a platform needs to know this. Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.    EDIT2: omg melvin is so sinister. They knew redditors would bandwagon. They are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME. PLEASE HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.  EDIT:                               CANT CROSSPOST SO COPY PASTA TO GET OTHERS SMARTER THAN I AM TO DISSECT IT
RH has lifted ALL restrictions on securities including GME and AMC.
Whether you’re on RH or not, RH has lifted all restrictions and it matters to us all because this is exactly what we have been waiting for. Stonk is already up 30% it’s on and crackin y’all!   Let’s go we like the stock!!!
Will GME be on SSR on Monday too?
It's on SSR today, will it be on SSR on Monday since it's 2 days, or am I wrong?
Didn’t know TD Ameritrade showed colors other than red
If you’re still in GME read and act.
Credit: u/turdfergusonlol  For some reason, my post got taken down so I'm gonna repost it again. The phone number's message box is full so the best way to reach out, for now, is through email. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.  To all the autist still want to go to the moon, I have the ticket right here:  +1(817) 424-2001  This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.  EDIT:  They also have an email in case you can't call    If you want more information    I HOPE I DONT HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT BE KIND IN YOUR MESSAGES AND EMAILS!!!  here's a good read by someone smarter than me    Template written by u/AVeryRealHumanity  Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud  Hello,  My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.  Thank you for your time,  Power to the players,  u/Precocious_Kid brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. "In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!”
To all those wondering why GME is up, Robinhood removed all buying restrictions today.
I hope this means another rally 🤞🏻
Where can I find post $gme content?
Hey, I’m holding my $gme but I want continue making money. Before $gme I came here for ideas, analysis, and opinions on stocks. Now it’s just a GME thread.   Is there another community I can use until $gme dies down? Need to turn 20k into 100k.  Thanks, Fredosantanashair
If I want to start investing, who should I begin with?
If this isn't a sign to hold, I don't know what is... #666
How do we profit on the downward drop after we take $GME to the moon?
I'm    my shares to take everybody for a ride. But I feel the only way to continue the ride and everybody make it out on top is to become to the hedge fund and short seller when the ride ends. So how can we profit on the way up and the way down??
Are there powerful entities who would profit from the GME short squeeze?
Dear banana-wielding common sense-challenged astronauts,  I love what you are doing to the moon! I hope that this community gets even stronger with time. Whatever happens down the road, you truly give me hope for humanity in these bleak days. The rich and powerful will always find fresh ways to rob us, but humour has always been the best weapon against all kinds of oppression. I have been laughing so hard these past few days - please keep the hilarious jokes and memes coming :)  I know very little about finance and the stock market, so I have been wondering:  If the system is rigged and the machinations inside opaque to outsiders, what chance do even the most insanely reckless excrement-hurling apes of winning?  I guess we could only win if somebody powerful enough needs us to enable even bigger gains for themselves.  So what do you think - are there rich people, companies, or politicians who would profit massively from $GME being catapulted to other celestial bodies by a bunch of groupthinking primates?  If yes, when do you think will they act, and to what end?    Don't mind me, I am so retarded that I don't even know how to buy $GME stock.
God damn GoPro!
Here is your Feb 5th shorts exit. If you bought the morning dip and flipped the rally, congrats on your free hedgie money.
Robin Hood's VERY BAD DAY in NPR Podcast... Go 16-minutes into the Podcast, they walk thru the story of Robin turning off the spicket
AMC/GME
Ya know, I’ve only been on Reddit for a few months. And I’m extremely, overwhelmingly shocked by this community here on WSB. Sifting through the posts, and seeing the true community here is ACTUALLY heartwarming. You ALL go around calling each other degenerates, autists, retards, paint-eaters, I mean honestly. WHERE ARE YOU GONNA FIND ANY TYPE OF BLOG/SUB TO BRING YOU SUCH JOY. I’m just stopping by to tell you guys y’all fucking rock. Fuck the SEC, fuck Melvin, fuck shorters, run this shit apes. The things I’ve seen you people do to AMC/GME the past few weeks. Crush the big guys, I’ll sit on the sidelines and watch with my popcorn.  #NOTfinancialadvice #lilmonkey EDIT; I FORGOT THE FUCKING
LoL wow...
This subreddit is hilarious, it’s an echo chamber of delusion... If you bought in at $300 sorry to say it but you won’t be getting that money back, it’s just not going to happen you missed the train bud.  Go ahead & keep holding tho mr. diamond hands  👊🏻🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Why are we not celebrating this bullshit?
They’re manipulating the markets to drive stocks down. They still haven’t covered there positions. HOLD
PSA: Don't join the Wallstreebets discord server - it is next level retarded in there
Yeah I just want to warn people who might join the discord server in the future, don't.  It's literally a spamchat of smooth-brains ,paranoid people, hedgies, stoned mods and trolls.  Only a few true apes are active in the stock chat(1 in a hundred, if even that).  It's a anxiety inducing nightmare.   Maybe when this whole thing dies over it will become better, I have no idea, but right now I do no recommend it, there is too much chaos and inconsistency atm.     Stick to this subreddit instead, where things move a tiny bit slower, but gets moderated & fact checked better.     Together we are strong. Buy & Hold.
Well fuck you and your financial advice, MarketWatch.
I've been watching CCIV the last couple days ahead of this rumoured merger with Lucid. IF (I know it's a big if) they pull it off, what do you think happens to the price next? Massive spike then drop?
MARKET MANIPULATION
If it it’s not obvious you’re being manipulated into selling GME then gtfo out this sub. Halted markets,ladder attacks you name it. I’m a retard my nose still works and something is fishy buy and hold are our only options. If you sell they win
Robinhood
I'm new to the stock world, but I've always loved Robinhood, but because of recent events I would like to change apps. What are other user friendly apps that do the same thing Robinhood does?
Yo PSA TO ALL APES RETARDS AND CHODES - IM STILK FUCKING HOLDING
If you have something shitty to say, disagree, or feel like giving me a lecture - 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 bishhhh

$AMC $GME HOLD
You have not lost anything if you don’t sell.  There cannot be a squeeze if you don’t hold!  It’s very simple. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE  This is not financial advise I just like the stock

Questions for interview with ex-Robinhood General Counsel Archit Shah
I'm interviewing Archit Shah for a podcast next week. Archit was the first lawyer hired by Robinhoodand built its legal department as he moved into the role of General Counsel. He's a smart dude!  Archit stepped down as of Jan. 1, so he's going to talk about his experience with Robinhood in his personal capacity only. What questions do you have for him?
$SNAP has great potential‼️
SNAP just exceeded analyst predictions for 2021. And at 55$. I think it's a great buy. I just bought some before market this morning. Everyone is betting against them but they have had amazing growth over the past year. No other social media can match their growth right now. It has already overtaken Twitter since the beginning of the year.🤞   Read up more:
New in this game, bought 2 GME and 5 AMC as soon as I could this morning. Let's see where this wild ride goes!    Baybeee
Organic growth? Pfft   🏽  🏽
Just catching on here and a little late but
What is the plan here? I love this whole steal from the rich, give to the poor thing going on here.
I'll say it again: BB gonna blast off!
BB isn't actually a meme stock.  It actually has pretty good fundamentals and business-wise it has good potential,  especially with EV on the rise and great leader John.  Going to hold for the long term and may potentially hit $50 in a few years.  1000 @   CDN     Also, I have 30 shares of GME @ 80        I LIKE the stonk.  NOT a financial advisor.
The amount of outstanding shorts barely declined. Still over 25 million outstanding
Aside from $GME, just a little heads up with what’s happenin with $ZOM
Personal story about having two types of diamond hands
I work at the shop we love so much, the one where people stop in to get games.   Last week, on one of the days when we were going up so strongly, a cute regular of ours came in, and was lingering much longer than usual. I mean MUCH longer, as in she hung out in the store for over half an hour.   At the end, after her transaction was complete, she asked to borrow a pen. When she gave it back to me, wrapped around it was a small sheet of paper with a note with her phone number and saying to call because she’d like to hang out, signed (I shit you not) -Diamond.   Yes, her actual birth name is Diamond.   A couple days later we arranged to have our first date tonight, and last night talked on the phone for hours, and it was wonderful...  So it looks like tonight I’ll literally have double Diamond hands          🥰     Edit: Tl;dr   I met a girl named Diamond at the game store and tonight will likely have Diamond hands literally and figuratively
GME - where's Mark Cuban, Elon Mush and Dave Portney now that restrictions are removed? How do we get their attention? Newb on the rest of social media here.
Incredibly cheap right now!
GME = Sauron?
Fellow retards,        Is this a sign?  Shieet
million degenerates buy at least 1 extra $GME share right now!
Repeat me you autist  TODAY WE BUY, MONDAY WE FLY AND THE WEEK AFTER WE FUCKING DIEEEEEEEE  Keep the volume up keep buying!  Target 100 today baby.  This is not financial advice I just like the stock honestly
Why am I afraid of puts, when 99% of my portfolio is calls? Irrational fear. How do I conquer for tendies?
I trade calls and shares all the time, but for some reason puts specifically scare me. They're no different than calls, I understand how the work, but for some reason they just freak me out.  I take screenshots of puts I want to buy, when I want to, and when the stock dips I look back at what I  could have  done and kick myself every time, but still don't follow through the next time. I don't know if it's the lower volume compared to calls, or if I don't like being right about seeing red. Anybody else have an irrational fear against puts?  #How do I break this cycle? I'm missing out on serious tendies!   Oh, and of course, GME    (in @ $179 per share).

Why did RobinHood halt trading of additional stocks like XM?
While everyone was looking at Robinhood blocking purchases of GME and AMC.. there were others on that list, that don't look so volatile, like the one mentioned above.
Rolls Royce just made a new deal with India
3 2 1 we have LIFTOFF!
I have 7 shares and my wife doesn’t know. I will hold and follow fellow retards til the end!
Is this a sign that my wife and her boyfriend are up to no good? Meanwhile, I’ll just hold.
Tomorrow..
Yes - before you ask I still have shares in GME - still holding those, though I cashed in some.     Tomorrow ( It's about 2am Australian EST atm ) I am going to wake up, gear up and get ready for work.. I'll shit/shower/shave as I have 6 days a week for the last 12yrs, though tomorrow is... different.  I don't need to go. I'll go and do the jobs as I'm conditioned to do.  I have a security system to go and look into on Sunday.   Such is life as a self employed tech.  I can't thank you retards enough for helping this old dumbarse as you have.  I have to start thinking and acting differently.  I don't need to work because I need to anymore - now I can work because I want to.     Thank you.

Buying from UK...?
Might be a daft question, but what is the best options for buying from the UK? Which apps/sites are good and/or have reasonable pricing?
Diamond Hands Only! Paper Hands DON'T READ THIS!
Buy more and HOLD. Dont do this to be rich, we don't need money where we are going. You must buy more and HOLD. HOLD. Come on you wallsteet outlaws HOLD.
Can someone do a reasonable DD on those two stocks we like that focuses on multiple factors, I don't think anyone really knows what's going to happen and you shouldnt assume you can predict the outcomes
Wsb got polarized and got an obvious echo chamber going on where people are downvoting/banning people smarter than me with real points, someone please try to do an unbiased deep dive on our stocks and if you're going to speculate then explain how it could go either way. All were getting is "to the moon" or you're a "sad retard holding bags" when there are many more details, let's go to the middle stop trying to be right and try to learn from all of this. I like video games, movies and self driving cars.
Why is GME price not going up even with this much volume?
'Trading 212' also limited buying the other day. What the Heck is this? From today 5th February.
Thank you WSB!
Came here the first day this GME stuff started blowing up.  Wanted to say thanks to everyone here. I’ve learned a ton already. Shorts. Puts. Calls. No clue what any of that meant. Still don’t really know how to do any of that stuff but it’s opened my eyes to a lot more that can be done.   Really glad to be a small part of a big movement.   Cheers! 🍻
If you still haven’t transferred your funds from RH, now is the time to buy and hold.
Gonna be honest I hate looking at GME right now...
Because all I see are some paper handed pansies!     We like the stock!
Newbie here..
Hey there, tossed a couple hundred into the Wealth Simple app here in Canada just to see some things happen. Anybody got any info on a company like BSquare Corporation? It seems to be going up a lot today and it’s pretty cheap. Besides that, anybody have any tips besides GME on what I should buy a couple shares in?
GME and AMC identical charts
Why does GME and AMC always have identical charts?? They aren’t in the same industry, they shouldn’t be moving the exact same way other than manipulation
Account peaked last week at 68k - Paper Hands on GME this morning to finish green
HOLDING UNTIL I SEE THESE FUCKERS START SELLING!! GME AMC
Bought late, not selling. I like the stonks! Hold till    🌕
Convinced my Boomer parents to buy GME on the dip. My father is getting into the spirit of the sub and my mother just thinks we're idiots
GME has been a hot topic in my household. Earlier this week, I bought 20 shares at $140 and 3 at $98. When the stocks dipped, my parents encouraged me to sell before I lost anymore than I had. I told them "Paper hands don't get you to the moon!". I then had to explain   ️ vs    to my almost 60 year old parents.  Well apparently my father is completely on board. This morning while GME was going up, my mother said she wanted to put a stop order on their shares. My father on the other hand just yelled "NO WAY, HANDS!! ✊✊". He may be a Boomer, but he's doing his best.   If my Boomer father can have    you can too!
NOVAVAX
The stock has rose a lot this year and saw a surge a few days ago, it's still undervalued and will likely get approval very soon in the united states and other countries. It will likely drop a little bit as people cash in, but I think it could see another surge later this month.
How is the $80 buy going for you guys?
Robinhood was giving me a sign!!  ✊  Still holding on, ty for the gains ya dum fvcks.
BUY YOU APES! DIAMOND HANDS OR DIE!!
We are at a turning point here, if we don't use this opportunity then we may well loose it! The shorts are there and we can make them pay! Looking at the volume today, there is a hella lot of speculation on this going down so lets prove them wrong!! APES STRONG TOGETHER.
From 50 to 70 in a matter of hours. Continue holding folks
So the hedge funds just borrow to ride this out?
The diamond handed here must fight fire with fire. Borrow every cent you can and buy GME. Liquidate your 401k. Get that cash out of your child’s 529 plan, sell your cars, sell your house and get a cheap room at the Motor Lodge for thirty bucks a day; tell your friends your kid has cancer and solicit donations; prostitute your body for extra cash to go long; get several jobs and dump those paychecks into GME; get a covid loan and put that shit to work in GME also. Visit your in-laws and snake their jewelry and power tools and sell it. Use the funds to buy opioids and resell those for cash to invest in GME. Go to several churches on Sunday and take funds from the donation jar. Snake the tips at the local coffee shops. Sell all of your clothes except for a large bath towel you can wear as a tunic. Do you have gold fillings in your teeth? That’s like having a call option in GME. Rip that shit out and head for the “cash for gold” place. Start cruising tinder hard and snake those credit cards when your date is in the restroom. Buy shit on Amazon and claim it didn’t arrive and then sell it. Office buildings nearby? Those are empty. Head in and collect the computer equipment and sell it. Manhole covers on your street? That’s just idle cash waiting to be invested in GME - snake those manhole covers and cash them in at the recycling place. It’s the only prudent thing to do, unless you want to admit that you are the ultimate form of loser: paper handed.   Disclaimer: Investing involves risks. Past performance does not guarantee future results. You could lose all of your money, especially if you are a paper handed bitch.
r/wallstreetbets has turned into NOTHING posts about holding AME & GME
It’s beginning to get a little bit old & sad
Who's still holding?

What a lovely bunch of people
The majority of people are on this sub. Whatever happens now, what a ride it’s already been. Nobody can take away that. Absolute bunch of legends  I’ve got a sneaking feeling is not over though. I’m holding no matter what. This rocket might just reach the moon yet

Vanguard giving me the run around to deposit funds
Over the weekend Vanguard instituted a 7 day hold on funds that are transferred.  The way to expedite this would be to wire money.  My bank initiated the transfer on Wednesday at 11 AM CST.  After being on hold 55 minutes, the Vanguard rep#1 ensured me it would be posted that evening or the following morning after talking with the wire department.  Queue to Thursday no funds, now Vanguard rep#2 (after being on hold for 45 minutes) talked with the wire department and now says it'll be a full 24 hours and if its not their it would have been denied.  Queue to today and my bank says it was returned due to "invalid account number".  The bank showed me the information and it has my correct account information with my name and my specific brokerage account number (have another IRA with Vanguard as well).    Just an FYI. Not very happy with Vanguard, going to look into other options and possibly move my IRA to another firm.
Hi, this is WSB customer service
We're experiencing difficulties at the moment
I’m at 72 boys. Will hold my 200 dollars to the
HODOR
Are there any apps that allow you to fund with credit/debit besides uphold?
Because that's why I'm using uphold... barely. The uphold app has only successfully let me purchase 2 times out of more than 30 trys randomly.
Remember we've got Lawyers/Interns/Regulatory Agents/Journalists here trying to build a narrative that justifies the actions of the hedgies and trading platforms. Don't let them.
So hey, I'm new (Not new to reddit, but I've been lurking in the shadows for a while now at WSB). First of all         . I'm only in for   of GME and 7 AMC because I arrived late at the party, and I will be holding until they pry them from my cold dead hands.    Moving on though...  The SEC and a LOT of lawyers right now are watching us. They are looking at you bunch of retards and trying like hell to find ways to justify how 1.) January 28th and RH blocking trading didn't actually mean that a shit ton of folks lost money. They're combing through these pages trying to figure out within a reasonable doubt how many of us would have purchased and how MUCH money their move legitimately cost us, but more importantly 2.) EVEN IF they prove that they fucked us over, they are going to look for justification about why "it wasn't that bad" and that those of us who lost money lost money because we "mob mentalitied (It's a word I made up, fuck you I'm a monkey), and that this was protecting us from ourselves. They're gonna pin this all on DFV if they can, painting us as lemmings and he like some red bandanad (fuck you, these are words) Pied Piper who just led a bunch of newbs to buy a stock because we're braindead halfwit morons (I mean, I am, but no less so than any of the regulatory agents trawling this sub right now).  They're going to look at all of these posts and look at all the people crying who are screaming about their life savings (which, wtf guys, what are you doing? No one said to do that, we're monkeys who don't give financial advice. Who are you listening to? Was it the hype? Was it the fact that it made CNBC? Who said to do that? Because it sure as shit wasn't the dumbasses here.) They're gonna pick and choose the statements made. They're going to pull out lines that demonize the mods/dfv/line holders as best they can, trying to paint us as a malicious activist group instead of just being people who like the stocks.  Anyway... the point is this: Recognize that if you're going to post you need to be aware that right now people with advanced degrees are writing a narrative that paints us in one way or another. Here's where we get to control it. We aren't some malicious mob and we weren't fucking coerced. We bet. There was a theory based on public information, we aggregated that public information and we BET (like the name). Bets can lose. Hell, odds are generally not in the favor of the person placing them most of the time. We played the stock market because we could. We continue to play the stock market because we can. This is how the stock market works. #sorrynotsorrymelvin  They're gonna look at these posts that you guys are crying that you bought in at 10k at 419 (               ) and say some shit that because they are smart lawyers or some shit that they need to protect us from ourselves so doing some kind of BS regulatory nonsense that will strip us even more of our trading ability or will somehow protect hedge funds from having to pay what they have committed to pay because a bunch of dumb internet apes drove up the price. They'll say it's to "protect us". So, here's the thing: Act like some goddamn adults, okay?  Yes, it sucks, the stock market has sort of ALWAYS sucked for the little guy. That's really the point. It hasn't historically worked for the little guy and right now based on what we do RIGHT NOW it will fuck over the little guy down the road or it will give us more freedom.  So do what you will WSB, but do it with the knowledge that we get to choose this narrative. We get to let those lawyers and interns and public officials know that we are not some fucking children who don't know what we're doing (No, we're retards and apes, goddammit, and to be fair, we know just as much as these hedge funds when we put our dumb heads together).  They're going to paint us as fools to be ridiculed and pitied because we bought high and our portfolios are as red as the lipstick that I hope the SEC leaves behind when they kiss my ass. So do us a favor and change the narrative. Stop giving these halfwits justification for c  down on us because of these boneheaded moves you made.  Yeah, You better believe I lost money but you wanna know WHY i'm okay with having lost it? Because fuck you, that's why. Because it's my money and I can do what I want with it. I invested it, I placed a bet, and I haven't cashed out so it's a Schrodinger's cat situation right now. It's still just as capable of going to the moon as I am, and I ain't dead yet, and even when I am these assets will transfer to my family with the instructions :               .  We're about to watch  , but right now they're positioning themselves to demonize him and make him the face of this whole thing. You're gonna have your grandma's and mom's asking you about who "this Kieth Gill is" and why he's a cult leader. Just keep that in mind.  So, hey SEC, want to know why I bought? Because I was around for the 2008 crash where a lot of really important people made a lot of really stupid fucking plays that crashed the economy. I have spent the last year paying close fucking attention to the pandemic profiteers and have seen how money has bled out one day after another from small businesses and people who don't have jobs or health insurance, or who are dying in fucking nursing homes that is bleeding their retirement and savings dry so that they can't leave money to their children for intergenerational wealth transfer.   So yeah, this stock, I like. This stock was a stock that I wanted to buy. I wanted to buy it because for one blissful moment it felt like there was some level of control that could be wrested away from these leviathans of the financial world playing games on the losses of companies and individuals.  Instead of small intimate "meeting of the mind" dinners where those responsible for billions just "have a chat" we talked as a group. Fuck you for making Kieth Gill your fall guy, and fuck you for what you're about to try and say about the group here.

All you smooth brained degenerates wanting to jump on GME now that it’s surging again if you didn’t pay attention to the loss porn over the last week STFU if it dips.  You had plenty of time to learn from the sad sacks losing their shit on GME. If you can’t tolerate that being you sit this one out or find less important money to lose.  GME to the moon.
ELI5: How is CNBC giving advice to GameStop to sell new shares of stock to raise money not market manipulation?
I had CNBC on the radio and at 10:22a ET, Jim Cramer and the others were calling the GameStop CEOs crazy for not selling new shares of the company to raise more money.   I tried doing some research into Cramer's actionable charity trust to see his positions on GameStop in there, but I'd rather spend money buying stocks instead of donating to that clown.   I really hope that the SEC investigates all avenues and makes their finding public. The rhetoric that Yellen used recently makes me think that nothing is going to change after these recent events.
The short GOAT Micheal Burry been tweeting a lot about whales coming in again. Get your popcorn ready.
EVEN I GME CLOSES RED HOLD
Guys we’ve seen what we can do. GME was up 55% at one point today which means there is still hope this fight is far from over. It seems as if every time we get momentum they halt the stock to scare people and make them sell off. DONT SELL that’s what they want us to do but even if we close red today seeing that there is still interest in this stock shows that all the media saying the hype is over is just false propaganda. Please guys we all need to come together and hold Bc this is when it’s most important
Screw Robinhood
Robinhood just forced me to sell my amc and nokia for a massive lost
WHOS STILL HOLDING?!
NONE OF MY POSTS ARE FINANCIAL ADVICE. BUT BUY YOU RETARDS
GME- LOOK AT THE BUYING VOLUME
Spent the last few days making a website to track how much we're holding in BANG
Pace your diamond hands
First time poster here, purchased my first GME stock. We've already triggered 3 halts since the opening bell. That's good, I see it as a tiny yet eager display of strength, a glimpse of what's to come all day.  Just pace yourselves, retards. Don't buy up too much stock too quick or it'll just trigger a halt, which will make GME go down again. We can slowly and steadily nudge GME upwards over the course of today without triggering a halt.   If we end up settling on even half a good number like last Friday, this battle isn't lost.  We got this people           (Not financial advice, I just like the stock).
Haven’t been seeing enough loss porn so here’s some of my own
Nice
For everyone telling us why we're complaining about trading halts

Stop posting these lmfao
No circuit breakers are not market manipulation please google what a circuit breaker is.  No that is not the current short interest please read the dates. New short interest report comes out the 9th and even that info will be at-least a week behind

Buying stocks on one broker then selling them on another?
Hello all, so I'm thinking of switching from RH to fidelity. Question is stated in the title. Would this cause complications on my taxes in any way? Like would I get sent a tax form from robinhood and then a separate tax form from fidelity?
Little guy here. Got 2 AMC & 1 GME

How many of you use this indicator for entry points? Any other indicators that would be useful for ascertaining dips intraday?

AMMJ American Cannabis Company - good BUY @ .373 rn
With all the stock craze, just wanted throw a bone out for the guys that lost $$$. AMMJ has been making pretty good gains this week. Monday’s price was   and it’s jumped to .373 in 5 days. Which is due to their new contracts they are making with others to drive their profits up, they’re ability to work in Colorado and they recently exceeded 100 retail distributors to carry their products.  Anyways, do your research first, but definitely look into this one. I think it’s a good buy.
I just don't understand primates.
I just don't get it,    the math is on our side, nothing illegal is going on.     GME is still somewhat around 120% shorted,    there are enough mad lads in here holding for dear life because at this point with the current loss makes no sense trying to save the last 10 bucks.   There ain't physically (digitally maybe) enough shares for the hedgies to cover  All we have to do is HOLD and the climb up is pretty much guaranteed because of math ffs.   The only catch is we have to have the numbers and given the recent crash, there's no doubt a lot of "comrades" have fled   Everyone knew from the get-go that some scummy tactics were going to take place at some point because fuck you the law applies differently to different classes (welcome to reality bitch)   Yet I keep on seeing lots of posts of people basically saying time to give up is over etc.  What I think we're lacking is a proper "promo  "   All the billboards are a great start, when the price was up to 350-400 it was mainly due to all the coverage this whole thing was getting.   Now that the hype has died down, it would need to be revived   Now more than ever is easy to get in with the current price per share of 60-50 bucks.   It's not even market manipulation because you just have to show the truth of the situation and expose the lies.  Hypothetically, those who drop some big bucks on GME should consider using some % of that budget towards ads, influencers, and whatnot   Remember the whole "Subscribe to Pewdipie VS T-Series movement" yea we need the same shit  You need to play the same game (no pun intended) that hedgies are playing.  You can literally just reframe the whole thing as it was WSB plan all along for this crash to happen to ppl can double down the investment at a much cheaper price.     I'm not a financial advisor, I just like the stock.   I'm retarded beyond recovery, I eat diamonds with my banana hands.   Why are you even listening to me? get help     6@$125 (yes I'm poor, gradually increasing)   \ \ it's not much but it's honest work\ \
I want to become a diamond hands.
Just like the title suggests, I want to become a fellow diamond hands, but because I am dumb as hell and in Canada, I'm not sure how to go about purchasing GME, anyone able to give me some pointers to the right direction?  Edit: Changed flair, my mistake.
I finally did it. After heavy losses yesterday I decide to hold to reach the perfect number. Only thing I can say "I DIDNT HEAR NO BELL"
Robinhood choose a side! YOLO
If they want redemption, this is it.
Dont forget about the FOMO Corp! $ETFM
I would say FOMO is a meme stock. They are still named $ETFM under OTC, but are awaiting FINRA for the name change to FOMO.  Germicidal disinfection, air purifying, PPE company. Also bought an LED lighting co and going into CBD.  This stock is legit FOMO.
It’s still early morning for some retards. BUY $GME before it goes to 1000%
Some states haven’t wake up yet. Ones they do the price is going to skyrocket! I mean solve-your-life-problems skyrocket, early-retirement skyrocket! BUY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!!!
$GME Shorts
The available short shares went from   to 55K in 1Hr. Are they trying to short it again? I don’t know I’m just a Panera bread head I don’t know nothing. But I like the stock I think I’ll keep them.

How is this possible?
How can BB,AMC,GME follow the same pattern everytime?  When one goes up, all other goes up.  When one drops massively all other drops too?

I’m seeing a bunch of brokers that say that WSB is responsible of the surge. When the fuck was sundial ever mentioned in this sub
Say it with me.. FUCK THE SEC!
That is all folks.
Can we be done with GME?
That train has sailed. Let's move on and talk about other stocks to invest in right now.
Hard to believe the volume just flopped outa nowhere...
SO MUCH FEAR MONGERING,LET US HOLD
Listen I understand you’re tired of all these GME posts but what do you gain by trying to make people panic sell?I know a lot of you are bots or just want old WSB back but old WSB isn’t going   can just help us end this NOW if you want it so bad but stop trying to get people to sell early for meager profits when we’re all doing our best to hold and buy.Godspeed retards And I’m not a financial advisor lmao
We can keep this show on the road! KEEP HOLDING! Dont let the rocket lose its Momentum!

If you’re new, you’ve come just in time for the blast off.
Why are you just in time?  - Purchase ticket today was $50 - well under fair value  - we’ve already seen +40%   - Trading restrictions have finally been lifted (but you better not be on RH or I will find you and I will hurt you).   -GME has a bright future ahead and this is a bargain price, the original DD predicted stock price around 200 even without international coverage, 8 MILLION retards and mf squeeze!
FFS, $1000 or BUST. LET'S GO!
Well?
To the moon, all aboard.🤣
AINT NO HALT ON AMC BABY, HOW IS IT NOT MOVING!!!!! MARKEY MANIPULATION! IM PROUD OF EVERYONE THAT HELD AND IS HOLDING
I fucking love how this sub is calmer in red
Everyone holding strong at red and as soon as it's green everybody is in unknown territory and confused Glorious apes combined Weak apes alone Hands are diamonds Dips are our comfort zone
This retard monkey will continue to hold but I wanna say something I haven’t seen mentioned. 🐒
WSB has forever changed the way people view the stock market. We’ve exposed the clandestine corruption behind the scenes. But let’s get real for a second... WSB apes were not the sole reason for $GME  . As much as we hate to admit it, HF helped us and now they’ve pulled out. They’re in the business of making money, not sticking it to themselves. Report after report is coming out about various hedgies growing substantially after going in on $GME and pulling out at the right time. Every cent from every monkey on here could still never compare to 3-4 HF. Only way we see a second squeeze is if some big time players put up. Papa Elon, Cuban etc.   The squeeze has been squoze unless we get more big time players on board. At this point we hold out of principle, any hope it goes above $200 is a lost cause, don’t play yourself.
I may be late to the party but Apes gotta stick together right?   🤚
So that is the Reason why, those cunts made huge profit of fucking over the honest apes
LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Hedge funds with bearish positions on GameStop, the video game retailer at the centre of the recent retail trading frenzy, made $  billion in profits this week as the share price dropped sharply, financial analytics firm Ortex said on Friday.  That comes after short positions on GameStop suffered cumulative losses of $  billion over January as a horde of small-time investors piled into the stock, inflating its price as much as 2,400% and forcing many hedge funds to buy them back to cover losses.  But the short squeeze has since ebbed, pushing GameStop shares 90% below last week's peak of $483.  Ortex data also showed hedge funds' profits from shorting AMC , another company targeted by retail investors, amounted to $430 million this week as of Thursday close.  In Europe, short sellers of Nokia stock made $126 million, the data showed.  (Reporting by Sujata Rao; editing by Thyagaraju Adinarayan)

I'M DOING MY PART!
Felt nervous
Not going to lie, I had a hard time sleeping the last couple nights thinking about how much I’ve lost on GME over the last week (bought 20 at $244 and 50 at $140). I told my wife how I was feeling this morning and she said, “you better keep those diamond hands”. I was surprised that she knew the terms and she said she stayed up until midnight reading all the posts on here last night and now she’s all in.  Thank you!!  Hold the line, I’m holding!!!         forever!!
Lets go boys, to the Moon.
I am small but I am here with you now!    holding til we get to the moon!!!

Explaining opening today
Large whale positions were opened up after open, peaking to 90 (where I bought and wouldn't you know it, the price goes down) and now sustaining at a value a bit lower than the peak. It could be a bull trap by shorts against the sub since the restrictions were uplifted. Trade carefully.
Let’s give them undeniable proof (Buy GME ASAP)
I don’t know if this has been brought up in a discussion yet but-  Robinhood lifted all restrictions on GME and AMC this morning, and the price is shooting up again. We’ll see what effect that will have, but the main point I wanted to bring up is this-   If we were to get the price high enough again that Robinhood/other brokerages put restrictions back on these stocks, wouldn’t that be definitive proof of market manipulation? I’m retarded and don’t know things, but a second round of restrictions coinciding with rising prices again seems to me it would be pretty blatant proof.  Edit- this isn’t financial advice, I’m retarded and eat crayons.
SEVEN halts on $GME trading, ZERO on $AMC
Wtf is up with this bullshit. Amc was not halted and was significantly lower(line chart wise) than $GME... they suspend trading on gme and then boom it’s now on the same line movement as amc. WTF!!! Do we have to stop buying this bullshit $AMC????
Are you retards setting the selling price at $69?

If anything comes of them coming after DFV we have to occupy.
Fuck the establishment changing the rules whenever they want. We were finally beating them at their own game and they pull the rug out. Now I hear they are coming after DFV for his daily updates. If anything, I mean anything, comes of this I will personally drive to Wall Street and pitch a tent till they drag me off. The Robinhood and WeBull executives are the ones who should be taken down in all of this. If DFV can’t even post his daily updates for fear of legal consequences then what has this page even become? There will be so many extra chromosomes on Wall Street they won’t know what to do with us all.   🏢🏛🏫🏢🏛          🏢🏦🏬🏛🏛         🏛🏦🏢🏫

Avoiding Foreign Currency Conversion Charges (Canadians)
Made a post about this yesterday re: what TD and other banks are charging every time you buy US securities with CAD, whether this is from a Margin, TFSA or RSP account. There is conflicting information on their website, as one commenter pointed out, it says a range between        It's actually only the spread on foreign currency, which changes every day and it depends on how much you're converting. For example, its about 1% for $30,000-44,000. On top of this, the $  commission is charged in the currency of the equity you are purchasing (  $10 USD for buying a US security).  Solution:  This part is based on TD Web Broker, but should work for other banks. Good new is, you can get around this by transferring you funds to a US RSP or TFSA account, which won't trigger penalties, as they are more or less than same account, only separated in your brokerage web page for visual clarity. You have two options for transfer: either go to Accounts and select 'Cash Transfers and Foreign Exchange' if its sitting in cash or 'Securities Transfer' if you have it tied up in US stocks. You can also call their Web Broker line, like I did, if the button isn't working. TD said it would take one business day for RSP and two days for TFSA to transfer. If you call and have them do it 'back of house, (  calling) you need to remove any pending orders, possibly also stop losses, or they may not start the transfer, as they will wait until orders are settled. In which case, it may be safer just to sell and transfer when you have the cash.     Once it's in the proper account (US TFSA) you will no longer be penalized for currency conversion, until you take the money out in CAD or purchase CAD stocks (or any non-USD listed security). Only cost should be the $  US commission on each trade, which is lowered after you hit a higher threshold of trades, per quarter.     Hope that helps.  Not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.
Can you autists shut the fuck up with these "WhOs StIlL hOlDiNg" posts.
Before any of you smooth brain apes say you cant read this and down vote. $GME  🤚       TO THE    Yes, we know you bought $GME at 300+ and are currently asking your wife's bf to not kick you out of the house.    Yes, we know you are so retarded that you only know 4 words and cant contribute a DD to explain to the other apes WHY we should still hold.    Yes, we know that you are so depressed from doubling down and pulling that 30k loan that you needed your parents to cosign on.    Yes, we know that you need validation that you are not alone. Go ask your wife's bf if you can watch tonight to feel better about youself.   Yes, we know how this ruins you life and you NEED it to go back up. Quit butching and show us the loss porn.   tl:dr Quit being retarded autists do some DD and show us the loss porn.   Positions: 32 $GME at $105 cost basis. Also any position your wife asks for.
Shoutout to GME and AMC for single handedly eradicating 6 months worth of growth
Grabbed my first infant stock yesterday and I’m surprised. Especially after GME
I took such a loss on #GME that my account balance went under $25k and I kept day trading, now I’m restricted...
$GME halted twice already this morning?

Held 55 Shares of GME since 2014, bought 14 more yesterday for good luck!
Maths question
If you invested $1000 in game at 500 then it dropped to 50 (90% loss), took the hit then reinvested your remaining 100 at 50, at what price would it need to reach to break even?
$WKHS FTW! Just saw Ford CEO on CNBC
The entire conversation revolved around their quest for an EV future and there was not a single mention them of competing for the USPS contract.    Very Bullish   on   WKHS   winning the US contract now!
Why is the Market moving so much? What is going on? (Oil and Retail)
Hey peeps. So decided to showcase a few things and kinda breakdown some strategy and why I am going very bullish on the   market.  Everybody is under the crunch currently due to COVID. Companies are releasing abysmal earnings reports and that has caused losses all around. So the market this pass week has been a bit of a roller coaster because of the above issue.  Then this morning the Market shot up during opening hours. Why is that? Well the answer lies here in this news story.    Now I don't care about the political implications of this. I only care about the Market effect. For those of you who don't know, Dems have rolled their stimulas plan that would give another 1400 bucks to Americans into what is known as a Reconciliation bill. Reconciliation bills are 1. Filibuster-proof and 2. Just require a majority vote. It's next stop is the house but just the IDEA that it's just one step away has launched some gains in this mornings trading session.   The truth of the matter is, you buy for the future-regardless of what you are buying.  Keeping in mind that you buy for the future (doesn't matter if you take a bullish or bearish position). You need to see what is going on and what is being discussed.  I will lay out my strategy concerning XOM.  The Reconciliation bill was being talked about for the past week (Again, don't care about the political implications. If you do, suck a dick. Here to make money). Dems have recently taken control of the Senate since passing the power-sharing agreement. Biden is still in his first 100 days and they are going to want to put a jewel in his crown. Dems called for a late night session to vote on 11 amendments for the Reconciliation bill and it passed. During the same time, OPEC (a bunch of oil countries who pretty much control the market) had their ministerial meeting and kept their targets for Oil production (they cut heavily) and have also announced that oil levels are now at a draw (more oil going out than coming in   We also got hit with jobless claims numbers and they were below expectations.  If I was a betting man (I am) I would put a bullish bet that Oil will be going up. Why? Due to the huge push of the Reconciliation bill, Oil now being at a draw, and less people that are unemployed. We can assume that there will be a huge demand for Gasoline with a potential that gas companies will be able to set the price that they want pretty much.   Now for the retail sector. More money in people's pockets means more shit they are going to buy.  Just remove the bit about OPEC.  I put a bullish bet on XOM going up with 35c call @ 48 3/5.   News and Rumors move markets gents. News and Rumors.
Everyone that held now will be rewarded. 40% up in a few hours!
Don't paper hand!  Just hold and watch the price rise again!   GME to the moon (rocket emoji and diamond hands)
It’s a sign!
My (almost) all in CCIV play    (I'm never letting go of my GME shares so shut it)
r/robinhood mod bans me for asking them to update a 5+ month old sticky thread, fuck RobinHood
RatPac a bag holder that got sold a naked story. Dude was banned months before GME even hit.

From   million available shorts to 55k in 45 minutes GME
Check for yourself here:    They're using all their ammo in the first couple hours with no restrictions. Keep buying!!  Position: 800 shares  EDIT: The link shows the amount of shares available to short. If it goes down, someone opened a short position which can cause a dip or kill momentum.  If the amount available goes up, someone covered their short position.

Attempting to clarify some misinformation going around about trading halts
This is an automatic feature built into the markets. It's not some evil HF halting trading to screw you over.  “Circuit  breakers can also be imposed on single stocks as opposed to the whole  market. Under current rules, a trading halt on an individual security is  placed into effect if there is a 10% change in value of a security that  is a member of the S&P 500 Index, Russell 1000 Index or QQQ ETF  within a 5-minute time frame, 30% change in value of a security whose  price is equal or greater than $1 per share, and 50% change in value of a  security whose price is less than $1 per share.”  Normal thing to happen when things are volatile.  Source:     NYSE Historical Trading Halts:       EDIT FOR FURTHER CLARITY:The stock was halted on the way down several times the other day. HOWEVER, its much harder to trigger these halts when the price is higher since its percentage based. Moving from $320 to $300 is not the same as moving from $50 to $70. Both moved $20 but they did not move the same percentage.
All you hedge fund paid corporate shills and naysayers, look at GME now! Suck it!
Prophecy says after the magic number has been reached at will never be crossed again.
Do you idiots think it's a coincidence that everyday GME and AMC are on the SSR list, the stock price trends upward?
How do you explain that? How come everyday the stocks we like end up on the SSR list, they tend to do much better after market open? This surely cannot be a coincidence. There is clear manipulation happening, causing the price to decrease, like we have seen all this week. It's clear the hedge funds are trying to tip the scales in their favor, this is evident in the data, the misinformation, and the flooding of    bots trying to dissuade is from holding.   Keep your   as solid as  . This fight isn't over yet.
So why are we not getting #GME trending?
Says there is like 500k people online right now. Why are we not pooling our resources together to get certain hashtags trending?   We all need to come up with a few hashtags on this thread and get them trending now!
Encouragement for WallStreetBets with the #SnyderCut example
I would like you to remember this while I hold my stocks with firm grasp and diamond hands.  Media and big companies have always,   always  , tried to tell us, the common people, what we should know or not. They have always tried to make us think it doesn't matter whatever they may be right or not, but to make us   fear   that no matter what, we will pay the consequences.  And I'm here right now to recall that they are NOT always the winner with a recent example. I know this looks like a big strech, but hear me out.  For years they constatly told us (comic-fans like me) that the famous   Justice League Snyder Cut   did not exist. And they came from all angles and purposes, to make us believe it could not happen, even if it really existed.  But nontheless, we fans endured. We take the bet and double down, we speak our voices and we prove them wrong.  Not only the Snyder Cut existed, even when the so called "experts" told us it was a myth and imposible, but next month it is gonna be released online worldwide. So to those all-knowing experts that keep telling us this is lost, and that we don't know about it, and that we should sell and take the losses... SHUT THE FUCK UP.  It doesn't matter if you, subreddit ape, like or not the Snyder style, cult, fandom or whatever.  What matters is that it existed and proved them wrong.  What matters is that strengh in numbers and holding the line was the right call.  As it is now.  So be strong and hold.  TL;DR: If we hold, we can win again, as we already did as a group when pressing for the SnyderCut
POLL $GME HOLD    OR SELL
Super curious here 👌
Doubled down and bought the dip. MGNI will continue to moon. I am tired of telling you retards to pay attention to this monster
Who just bought at 82 to watch it drop down like I just did?      🍆🍆🍆
Learn from me and don’t invest meme money if you have to think if you can afford it or not.
Lesson learned... bought some at like $350 for the political statement... then it dropped off and I took the L.  And my   took the L too. And I didn’t take a deductible into my budget before buying.  So if you have to  look over your budget and spend time thinking if you can afford a meme stock.  Do yourself a favor and make sure you have   plenty of wiggle room   before you invest SERIOUS (relative to your income/savings) money!   And if you do buy, make sure to budget as if you lose it all.  I think this’ll seriously set me up for much wiser budgeting in the future though. Thanks for everyone here along the way. I ain’t here no bell yet.  !STILL NOT SELLING!
Trading halts are normal, stop making use look dumb, we are retarded. Get it right.
Listen up you fucks, trading halts are normal when stock is extremely volatile. If the price goes up or DOWN a set percent in a certain amount of time it gets halted. Hold,buy or papperhand, I don't give a shit, just stop spreading misinformation. For fucks sake it's a two second google search to see if the halts are normal.
Gme needs a rally and it needs one now

Insane volume accumulating.. we’re launching.. seatbelts on!  🤲🏽
Why is nobody talking about the NOK & NASA contract?
They're literally building a 4g network on the moon.  I know the stock has been stagnant for the last decade with little blips here and there, but the more I dig into Nokia, the more I can see them being a power player in the coming years.  I know people say they've been burned on NOK in the past, but I think they're future is looking bright.  I'll probably lose on this, but they're literally going to the moon one way or another, and that's good enough for me.  200 @ $    10c Jan '22   7c Jan '23
Remember the dip (dodge, duck, dip, dive & dodge)
For all you new new tardos jumping into the pool today. The dip usually hits between now & 11:30am est from what I’ve gathered of the last few weeks. Don’t panic, don’t sell, just hold and use your head.  I am a meat popsicle, not a financial advisor
Can amc stop acting like coke dick
Seriously amc is acting like I’m on a bender trying to get it up with a hooker.
Missed opportunities for those obsessing over GME
While most of you were caught up, I threw $5k at Snapchat yesterday in its dip at $51 and just sold at $59 today. There’s money to be made in the market outside of GME, NOK, AMC.
The game is rigged
Robinhood just closed out my GME without my permission
VFF YOLO
Which of you retards made me almost crash to get this picture on my Nashville commute? AMC TO THE MOOOOOON!!11!1!1!1!1!!

Buy your GME now! It’s down at $75 per share buy it while it’s still cheap!!
HOLD YOU LIMP DICK PANSY LEPRECHAUNS!!!!!!!
GAMBLING AND WEED MOON THESIS
I know we're all locked in on GME at the moment I'm underwater from 150 and diamond handing it. But I have a thesis given the state of the country and what seems to be a once in a lifetime opportunity around untapped sectors. States are hurting BAD for tax money from covid and the economy shutting down. There are 2 sectors/markets that were previously ILLEGAL but are now becoming mainstream and slowly shifting to legality. WEED and SPORTS BETTING!     Not only are these newer markets but they are huge tax generators for states and governments. I think that within the next 5 years all 50 states will have fully legalized both things and these assets will MOON. There are plenty of companies you can do your own research but the sectors in general are massively undervalued IMO.

Spoke to a reporter about misleading media
Hi guys, My friends and I are working on a fledgling school project turned business venture in which we hope to provide factually purely data driven updates on all media posts (not just the Reddit’s but the big companies too) pertaining to stocks at a low cost to retail investors ($1 a month for students, $  for everyone else) we are really just getting setup but our earlier data possibly contradicts several major articles. We have simply started the process of giving the reporter the data.   Anyways I will post an update if you guys want once we are ready.  In addition as some analysts have claimed, these social media trends are dangerous, well we also hope to protect retail investor by using again data driven exclusively, fundamental scores, so retail investors don’t need to spend hours browsing Reddit’s and reading potentially biased dd, though your own investigation is still recommended as we just provide end recap data.   We are just setting up a discord and our website. I will post links hopefully by the end of the week if mods allow.   If you have interest in this idea please let me know or if you have concerns. I am genuinely trying to build a company for the consumer not the hedge funds and have seen some much misinformation today, data is the only solution.   The idea is called Modern Media Business systems or MMBS :)   Thanks everyone!    our current internal name for the bot that pulls data is   as a node to all of you, and myself, who in fact has autism, though mine is minor compared to the severe disability some suffer from.   Also I lost some on BB and currently am likley to lose a bunch of GME and NOK. So I guess I am an autist in several ways now.  Autist is the way.
BUY NOW OR NEVER FELLOW APES! IT'S AT 60€

GameStop shares rise after Robinhood lifts trading curbs
Ahhhh I see what chart you GME Apes are following
Each new GME, we buy they IMMEDIATELY short it.
This whole shit, man.   You can look at it and wonder if they just suspend things to quickly short new stock just bought into. Looking like an inversion.  It's crazy to think but if that were happening it would be something like, every time you bought a brand new stock, they would immediately slap an oversold short on it attempting to undersell it for pennies less, each lot. And mapped out it would look like, every time a purchase was made, it was undersold immediately after, making it look like it was going down each time.
Ready to buy 2 shares of GME. Is it even worth it?
How many shares should I buy to make it worth my investment?

Dumped about half my GME to reinvest in more stable stocks
I lost about 15k in GME alone, so I sold half my shares at an $85 limit this morning and reinvested into HA and a couple others for longer term gains to offset the losses.   Sure, I’ll leave the other shares in GME, with hope in my autistic little heart, but I’m not gonna try to retire on GME..   Best of luck folks!
Plan for AMC and GME
Here's what I'm gonna do.  Wait for Elon Musk to commercialize space travel.  Go get a physical certificate of my shares.  And take those motherfuckers to the moon with me!!   TO THE MOON!!         AND I'LL STILL HOLD !!!

Bull Thesis for Boeing ($BA)
TLDR: I like the stock  Boeing has had a rough couple of years. In 2019 the 737 MAX was grounded and in 2020 the pandemic saw a massive slowdown in revenue for Boeing. The stock went from $446 to about $350 when the 737 was grounded, to a low of $89 in March because of the pandemic, and is now trading at around $210.  As the vaccine rolls out, and the 737 being approved for service, I think Boeing is one of the last great covid recovery plays and I think we will definitely see a reversal of their fortune in the long term, with great short term potential as well.  Operating as a duopoly with Airbus, Boeing has an exemplary economic moat and has years of backlog that will provide some good revenue. They have a history of providing military aircraft to the US and abroad. They are not going anywhere, regardless of the potential dropoff in civilian air traffic.  They've found strong support at this current level, and I think this is the start of the climb back to their pre covid/pre 737 price. Wouldn't be surprised if it is flirting with $500-600 in the next couple of years.   I have no positions, I'm taking a break from the markets and the stresses involved with it. I'm gonna focus on doing what I love and part of that is writing and posting DD here.
Was that the squeeze?
Given that the stock was so low, did we just witness short positions selling everything off?   It went from $50 to $80 in seconds.  There’s no way that was due to Robin Hood restrictions. Yesterday we could buy 500, that in itself would have shown an increase.
Another comment that was sent to me about #GME
First, I plagiarized this entire thing from u/bikmen on a separate sub. But it is tremendous DD and must be spread. Second, it is absolutely vital that we stay together and understand these (mentally)-Alpha-(physically)-Beta-male cucks at Melvin and more importantly, their sugar daddy Steve Cohen n friends, ARE PLAYING CHESS, NOT CHECKERS. Why the fuck would the sugar daddies give Melvin a weekly allowance of $  just to shit it down the drain........ take a read at U/bikmen 's glorious perspective below    Fellow apes, I believe we are in a very interesting position right now, and we still face the very real possibility of seeing a massive short squeeze on GME. Full disclosure: 11 shares @ $180 average, I am poor college ape. This is also not financial advice, I am dumb ape. This is going to be a long post. I know you apes hate reading, but I think this post is going to contain some very helpful and reassuring information for many of us, and I encourage all ape to try their best to read. TLDR at bottom for silly monke. Let's take a moment to consider where we are with respect to GME, and rethink all the events that have just unfolded over the last few weeks. Starting early January, we saw the price of GME hovering just below the $20 mark. GME had been floating around the $10 - $20 range since about mid October. As GME started to increase in popularity on WSB, due to rumors around Ryan Cohen's interest in the company, the price continued to increase. During this time, short sellers began rapidly opening positions because they believed GameStop was headed to bankruptcy due to the shift away from physical retail stores, and because they were betting the hype around GME would eventually die off and the share price would fall. On January 11th, Ryan Cohen gained a seat on the board, held a 13% stake in the company, and the share price jumped almost 20% to $  This is an important date and an important price in our story. The January 15th official short interest report stated 61,780,000 shares had been sold short. On the 15th, the share price was about $35. This is a crucial piece of information to consider. Short Interest is reported twice monthly, so the last report before January 15th was from December 31st, and the next report won't be issued until February 9th. The next report will show short interest up to January 29th. Keep that in mind, I'll come back to this point later. Back to the January 15th report.   million shares had been shorted at prices less than $35. Every single short of those   million was betting the price would be less than $35, and it's more likely that most were shorted around the $15 - $20 mark. I don't have exact numbers, but for the sake of simplicity and also conservatism, I am going to assume these   million shorts were for $30. These shorts would only make profit if the price was to go below $30. For ape who STILL doesn't understand what shorting a stock is, please read this. On January 15th, at least 130% of the float had been sold short. Yes this is possible, and does not necessarily indicate wrong doing by hedge funds or market makers. The January 15th report serves as one of the main catalysts for the giant price leap from $35 to $483. The report was released on January 27th, and the share price hit $375 the same day, followed by a peak at $483 on the 28th. Since then, the price has decreased all the way back down to $65 at the time of writing. This is where we get into the main point of my thesis, and why I believe we should not be worried about this massive drop in price. My argument: MOST short positions from the January 15th report have NOT covered yet. Why would they have? What we saw from January 11th to 28th was a run up fueled entirely by hype and a couple of gamma squeezes. The short squeeze did NOT happen. But it will. Hedges are still better off paying their interest payments on their short positions than covering millions of shares for prices over $300. The hedge funds and other players were able to drive the price down from $483 to $65 in less than a week. Regardless of the illegal actions they took to make this happen, it is still the reality we face. Their biggest win was hitting a big stop-loss raid when the price went down to $250. The price was forced down not just because of "short laddering", but because they were able to hit psychological prices were many holders had set stop losses. $250 stop losses dropped down to $225, which dropped down to $200, etc. Shares were sold at these prices, not to the shorts looking to cover, but to other retail investors and some institutions hoping for the eventual short squeeze. The hedge funds knew they would be able to do this. It didn't even take that long. In 6 days they had brought the price down over $400. So why in the world would they have covered even a single share above $100?? Answer: they didn't. They are waiting to bring the price down to an acceptable level, buying far OTM calls, and letting
$69 is my jam
Waiting for a top up to clear - give me some $GME
WAIT HOLY FUCK IM GREEN AGAIN ON GME
BUY GME AND AMC
Don’t listen to the bots telling you to get out while you can. We’re going to the MOON        🤲.  This is not financial advice. I’m not a financial advisor
Reinforcements coming! Hold the line so we can buy the dip and get some   !
Holding my 5 GME at $128 because I can afford to lose it all.
AMYONE ELSE HOLDING AND UNPHASED BY THE UP AND DOWN?
I'm holding, and have been buying all the way down. It increased my basis to $27. I don't give a fuck.   It is a certainty that there are still a shitload of sorts that need to cover. If we all hold on, it is also a certainty we will sale a lot of money. The only variable is if we are more volatile than the stock.  If we hold, and don't let fear or emotions get the best of us, then exhilaration will be the next emotion.

Why is there so much negativity towards holders?
Not everyone yeeted their life savings away. Not everyone put thousands of pounds down. Not everyone has taken a fat L. I put an amount of money I can afford to lose down. I made a bet. If you’re playing poker any money you put on the table dissapears if someone has a better hand. A lot of us are at peace with the fact that we won’t see the money that we put down again. There’s literally no point to sell if you managed your risk and have hope. People are acting like we’ve ruined our lives by taking a risk lol.   I know a lot of people put down more money than they can afford and they’re currently in some shit, but that’s not all of us. Please stop acting like everyone currently holding is a braindead moron that’s ruining their life.   Me with a measly   shares @ avg £130 (Spent £300).

How $GME can win
MY POST KEEPS GETTING DELETED AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY, BUT UNTIL THEN IM JUST GONNA KEEP REPOSTING THIS. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR.     To all the autist still want to go to the moon, I have the ticket right here:     \\+1(817) 424-2001 (inbox is full rn, so shoot them an email instead)     This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.     \      They also have an email  in case you can't call \      If you want more information \[      I HOPE I DONT HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT BE KIND IN YOUR MESSAGES AND EMAILS!!!     \      here's a good read by someone smarter than me       \      Template written by u/\      Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud     Hello,     My name is \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_ \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_ and I currently own \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.     Thank you for your time,     Power to the players,     \      u/Precocious_Kid brought up a point: We should ask for a reverse stock split. "In the event that the reverse stock split happens, Citadel and the phantom shares creators will be stuck holding all of their losses on those short positions!
I AM THE ONE WHO NOKS
LADIES AND GENTLEWOMANS I PRESENT YOU YOU THE LINE
In my opinion the green line is the one we have to hold. Also the red line is the line the bears needed to defend and we broke that one. Note the volume, there is no way in HELL that the bears covered their positions. Don't listen to me im just another smooth brained diamond handed gorilla who doesnt know how to add rocket emojis to reddit on my laptop. Not financial advice but I'm buying because i like this stock a LOT. You all can see the price level of the line. I challenge every paper handed nay sayer pussy who bought @ 200+ and sold at 50, only to rebuy at 140 when the momentum comes back, to zoom in on your own little charts and see what happened the minute it came below the war(green) line.     Position:  GME   @ $   Edit: CAME BACK ON MOBILE TO ADD THESE BADBOYS       🐵🌜
Magical!
Need proof that bears are still all over GME? Available shorts yesterday >1,000,000. Today? 200,000
This week. the shorts have effectively had their way with GME. They're all fucked if we keep this price action going.
Robinhood Transfer question
Did anyone else get an account transfer out of robinhood?  Looks like they sold a lot of my stocks (no documentation)?  Edit: There was fractional shares and they stayed in Robinhood account. I had a cash deposit of some money but no documentation of it which is why I’m concerned. All the GME stocks were originally bought before this GME craze (I would have bought more when the craze started but the was restricting buying).  I will update this if I hear back from the broker I am transferring to.
Nice 😎
$tiMuLu$ CHECK goes BRRRRrrr...
Yesterday I did a very controversial post talking about the stimulus package and how in the end it will go to GME.  Plenty told me there was no going to be anything and that I was an idiot to even promote it. Sir, I am a retard but no idiot! Seriously do you think 1400USD will change the life of an average household? People treated it as it was the golden grail but guess what. Most likely if you are reading this and are into savage porn loss you know the risks involved. Also you know that whether 1400 won’t change your life, risking it for a banana might just give you enough tendies to relax a bit.  If you do not have money and are living pay check to pay check most likely you are not even in this subreddit as a lot of you degenerates surely have a pc setup or gaming equivalent to those 1400.  All I am saying is that Ape must be United! For all of you paper hand bitches folding the previous days, we are already seeing pumping numbers!  This is not financial advice but last time a stimulus check was written cyber money and the stock market pumped like crazy! What makes you think that it will not be the same with GME!  These HF are scared and are starting to close their positions cause they know we retards can achieve great things if we stick together. I am not American so I won’t have a check. But if I did I would stick it right in these HF asses and the SEC for not supporting the little guy and for satanising us and going after us!  Sorry for the long post my fellow apes. Here have a potato and a banana! 🥔
For the 1% of you looking for plays other than GME/AMC/BB, look no further than IPOE.
If you missed the news about a month ago, Chamath announced a target for his SPAC IPOE to merge with SoFi. No date is announced but it’s expected to happen in the first quarter of 2021.   For those unfamiliar with SoFi, it’s essentially a very user friendly online lender. At least that’s what it started as... they now also offer commission free brokerage services, and are applying for a bank charter as well which would be a huge catalyst for growth. I believe this company will be a disruptor in the tech finance space. Here’s an article with some more info  .  The short term is always tricky with a pre-merger spac, so shares and leaps are the best positions IMO.   Positions: shares, 3/19 25C, 1/21/22 40C. And have been adding more on every dip.
No clue what I am doing, down 400$ in 5 mins. NP Beastie Boys - Get Retarded
Looking for a reason to make my wife's boyfriend LOL @ me later tonight when he brings her out to dinner, so I bought 3k$ of these stonk things people have been talking about lately for the first time. Not sure how this all works but right now my stonks are going into the red a few hundred. Guess I will have myself a bowl of soup with a fork!  Edit: GME is the stonk I bought. Thanks for the support, now I am considering buying another 3k$ worth in this dip.
For the love of Satan BUY.

Has everyone tried reverse psychology yet?
All of us still holding have been saying "to the moon" for so long, and that has not worked. So maybe if we root for red we can trick the stock into going up? It's so retarded it just might work.
It ain’t much, but i‘m holding with you
For many of you that forgot about this, cause spammers claims its “OVER”   WILL HOLD TO THE MOON!!! WHILE YOU KEEP SPAMMING ITS “OVER”

JUST BOUGHT MY FIRST GME        diamond hands Boys
37 million volume
This is nuts ... what's even more nuts is were stagnant around 70 .. so who the fuck is selling enough to off put the buys and why the fuck are you selling for a 15$ gain ....    Bought in at 34  20 shares,  still holding
If I've learned anything the past month, it's that investing with the boys is always better than investing alone. 😎
I love you guys.  I've been around here off and on again for a few years. This is the first time I jumped in on something, and I did it because win or lose, I wanted to be on the team, playing the game.  I'm considering starting up an investing club. While I've been doing this for a little while (about three years), I'm still really green and have a lot to learn.  The other thing I've learned is that with the tools at our disposal, it's really become possible for us little guys to stand up to the evil Oligarchs. To some degree, we can play ball with them. I only see this becoming more feasible as the years progress.  Would there be any interest in starting a trad investing club? We would primarily look for gains from companies who aren't bastards. Screw Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and all the other companies with dirty agendas.  What if we worked together to strengthen companies with values that protect us and empower us?   I started investing in Tesla when Musk said he was leaving California because of the restrictions, when he said that he was opening his factory against orders to shut down and that he would be on the floor with his people.  I respect that. That's a leader I can get behind.  I'm kind of just gushing here, but I wanted to know if there any like minded investors who would want to team up and share information.  Also, I just wanted to say how much I love you guys and how much it's been a pleasure playing the game with you. Here's to getting more tendies. Bears are gay.    Edit:   some of the comments seem to be disappearing. I don't know if it's because any rules were broken or not. I feel like this post might be borderline, so out of respect for the mods who work so hard to make this community happen, feel free to message me if your comment was deleted or you think it breaks the rules or something.     To the mods:   keep working hard. Keep up the good work. Sorry if this post skirts the rules.
First shares. I really like these stocks 🥺👉👈

I'm not in for much, but:     Well, here I am! It's all I can afford at the moment but at this point, it's been a fun learning experience, and I don't regret any lesson I may learn from this. Gonna hold these stonks FOREVER.
$MGNI 500 percent gains over one week. 2x 35c 2/19, 2x 40c 2/19, 10x 45c 2/19, 3x 50c 2/19. Sold this morning at various prices
Can you tards wait?
Fuck, let this alcoholic have his coffee before you start your banana orgy, apes. I’m already in but still too blurry to find the buy button. Give us mentally disabled people at least until 11am. Fuck.          Edit: found the buy button. 5k more on GME
Robinhood lifts bans  🧤
Real diamond hands buy at the peak
Are SPACs allowed again? $CCIV
I'm just saying right now, the stock trades as a SPAC at 10 dollars a share. And by the way, John, our analysts indicate it could go a heck of a lot higher than that. Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment would be upwards of $60,000!  Jesus! That’s my mortgage, man!  This has been pretty much (half) true with like 10 SPACs last year btw.
I’m not selling!
JUST HOLD
ETSY
Been holding the stock since 195$. It’s bullish and reaching all time highs since then, it’s at 235$ today and the stock is worth the investment.  I don’t consider myself a professional trader, but I studied financial engineering and I do this on the side. The company is solid and worth taking a look.
This is the way
Not a conspiracy theorist, but why is trading only suspended on the way up!
Serious question. We go up 20% in 30 minutes - SUSPENSION. Goes down 30% in 10 minutes - CRICKETS.   Is this pure manipulation or is this common practice? Seems incredibly one sided.
Remember, Mark Cuban literally CAME TO THIS SUB AND TOLD YOU TO HOLD while Elon shitposted Gamestonks! on twitter and paper hands still folded.
Remember that? Good times lol.
If you had FOMO from round one it looks like this is your second chance to buy in   🏻
Alot of slippery hands on GME
I thought we had diamond hands I see you bastards selling get a fucking grip we can keep this dead cat bouncing to the moon!
Trading Halted -_-
Every time they halt trading on a specific stock, I imagine my little brother saying “wait wait do over” when he sucks at something
BOUGHT MORE GME TODAY,BUYING EVEN MORE ON MONDAY
Buy GME!!!!!!
Bought   shares at $222 a piece holding till the ps6 comes out idgaf   Not a financial advisor
Stop looking at the ticker, go outside for a bit.
if no one is selling for an hour or two, things can really change.  Find a distraction!      EDIT - this was for the    who sell every time it crosses $80.  They need to find something else to do (maybe watch their wife and her BF for a bit) and then come back to watch it climb more later.
Google Finance might be displaying projected earnings as reported
I'm looking at our Blue Chip stocks this morning and a quick search with google was showing the projections of each quarter as reported.  Screenshot of google search
Just to put things in perspective
BULL TRAP!!!
Here it goes... GME YOLO
EVERYBODY GET READY    🤲 HOLD
It ain’t much but it’s my weed money for the week
Should I buy more $AMC?
I'm already $670 balls deep, bought 46 shares at $  like a true retard. I just got additional $180, should I buy more AMC shares? And finally, when do you think it will blow up? Will it blow up at all?
Nice.
Short squeeze about to happen
But in the other direction, hitting 30-40 today lol
Serious question
Does anyone know why GME shares are currently ~$68 on Robinhood and ~$82 on TD Ameritrade? I’m a bit new and is this a normal thing?
Can we stop mentioning $NOK?
The $GME $AMC crew has done nothing to help or support $NOK and yet all they do is list it when bringing up their meme stocks. This stock had 1 pump and dump and now it’s categorized as a Reddit stock when it really shouldn’t be, it’s really hurting the value for those who actually have held this stock for a long time and see value in the company.
Let AMC go to the moon!
Now that the restrictions are gone, we need to buy buy buy. They will have to cover their shorts, and we fuck them with that. AMC go       I'm in 200 @ 7, was all I could afford without getting problems
THE ROCKET IS FUELING BOYS  🙏🏿
BUY AND HOLD BROTHER APES! BUY AND HOLD! ⛽🙏🏿   IT'S OPEN, IT'S OUR TIME!
HOLD THE LINE
A question of patterns
I'm thinking we shouldn't expect it to go straight up now. After its sudden drop the last few days and now sudden rise I feel the idea of short ladders aren't so "made up" as many seem to believe. With that in mind, if hedge funds have the power to manipulate stock prices they will surely try to play on our psychology to make us sell. So if you see it drop today or next week, keep that in mind and don't freak, if indeed they can affect the price they will try to make us feel like it's hopeless.  I bought in more at 200 thinking it would surely go up, then it obviously didn't and I ran out of buying power. So don't expect set patterns.   This is not financial advice, I just like the stock and been holding long. I also drink soap.
Seriously, WTF is going on!?
They blocking and unblocking new trades when is obvous people wanna buy, this is bullshit.  I'M PROUDLY HOLDING.     EDIT: It's circuit breakers. Whatever, this is BS, people must be allowed to freely buy. I know it's for market protection, but it pissees me off.
THE GME CREED
These are my GME shares. There are many like it, but these are mine.   My GME shares are my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.   My GME shares, without me, is useless. Without my GME share, I am useless. I must hold my GME shares true. I must hold harder than my enemy who is trying to defeat me. I must hold before he must cover. I will...  My GME shares and myself know that what counts in this war are not the gains I make, the noise of our autist battle cries, nor the loss I take. I know that it is the autism that count. I will go full R...  My GME shares are human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its P/E ratio, its market float, its support and its resistances. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my GME shares clean and ready. I will become part of one another. We will...  Before DFV, I swear this creed. My GME shares and myself are the defenders of this community. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.  So be it, until victory is Wall Street Bets and there is no enemy, but peace!
Blaming us for manipulation AGAIN
I am not going to say the ticker since we have a 1B or less ban but somehow we still pump a stock.  It is disgusting to me that they are allowed to do this.
GME vs AMC - 5 Day - LOOK AT THAT TRADING PATTERN - SEC is that normal?!
Was that just now more autists buying in or shorts being covered? Fri (15:00 GMT)
They're squeezing slowly...
They're probably going to let the squeeze a little everyday until shorts are all closed since they know we're still holding.
GME is gonna squeeze soon
Just look at the influx of bots telling people to sell today. That the price won't stay above 100 for long. Show em they're wrong y'all. Buy more on the dips and let's keep ascending.  This is not financial advice.
Tradings open again. Looks like tendies are back on the menu boys!
$NOK $NOK   Due Diligence & YOLO Update
Price Target    Worst Case - $9 Base Case - $30 Best Case - $72  There has been a significant increase in Short Interest in the last few days. (Source: u/EasyRutabaga3768 's post from this morning)       Positions/YOLO Update    $NOK 623 $10C JAN2022 (bought Jan 25, 2021) average cost of 60cents/contract          Due Diligence    Nokia  is no longer the company your dad or grandpa remember it as. To  understand the value behind Nokia you have to understand 5G and what it  means in terms of the 4th Industrial Revolution. In my opinion, Nokia is  extremely undervalued at $  as it is trading at 1x revenue and its  place in the global 5G infrastructure is not being adequately  represented at its current valuation.   I  will be doing a deep dive into 5G and what it means for the post-COVID  economy, how Nokia fits into Cathie Wood’s investment philosophy, Nokia  financial overview and some technical analysis.  Many  of you will assume that 5G is mainly for smartphones. That is not the  case. 5G is the most important telecommunication upgrade cycle since  cell phones first came out. Why you may ask, that is because of  advancement in robotics, autonomous driving/MaaS (Mobility as a Service)  and Internet of Things. Each industry segment mentioned has the  potential of becoming a $300 billion sector.     Robotics    Have  you seen the new Boston Dynamic bots, those things are agile, smart and  completely human like in their mobility. They are sturdy and built like  tanks. Why does robotics matter well that is because high tech is  coming after every “dumb job” that is out there. Notice how Amazon,  Costco and Wal-Mart use robots in their warehouses and fulfillment  centres. Modern robots will require extremely low latency when  communicating with its handler/command center. That is where 5G comes  into play. To get extremely low latency you require a sprawl of 5G  equipment meters away from each other. This adds more demand for  equipment compared to LTE as their frequencies are able to travel  farther than 5G frequencies. Robots will be used for security  surveillance, construction, healthcare, manufacturing and in the  services sector. Out of the previously mentioned sectors, healthcare is  the largest and most lucrative. Robots will be used as the interface to  perform diagnosis of patients (TeleDoc anyone?), making it possible for  highly qualified doctors to serve remote communities. Furthermore,  robotics will be used for remote surgeries and the last thing I want is  lag when I am being stitched up.        Autonomous Driving    This  is where 5G comes to life. Apple partnering with Hyundai and focusing  on self-driving technology is huge news in tech. According to CNBC  Hyundai’s main focus for the future is Mobility as a Service. To get to  that vision of full autonomous driving you require cars to communicate  with each other with low latency. That is where 5G comes into play.  There are two wireless standards for this tech Wi--Fi and 5G cellular.  China has made 5G the standard but the American Federal Government has  told the industry to make the decision for themselves. The American  Automotive Association is advocating for the cellular standard due to  security and advanced technology. Ford has gone through and made 5G  cellular their standard. GM is the only one that is choosing Wi--Fi.   To  bring autonomous driving to life we require an intricate 5G  infrastructure in cities and interstate highways to get full autonomous  driving. We are getting there sooner than later due to Tesla’s  incredible machine learning algorithms and all the data that every Tesla  car collects. 5G will add another layer of security which will allow  regulators and law-makers to give the go-ahead.          Internet of Things    This  is the coolest part of 5G as everything will be smart. From street    to gas/electric meters to farming equipment. IoT combined with Big  Data will allow our economy to become highly efficient.   Here are a couple links to how this all plays out using 5G:              # Nokia & Cathie Wood’s Investment Philosophy   Link is broken down due to AutoMod         https:// youtu  .be   /XaUYx4iU\_hk  According  to Cathie Wood, during a great economic disruption that is when  innovation takes off and experiences exponential growth. She states that  during the tech bubble that is when the seeds for the 4th Industrial  Revolution were planted. Just notice Nokia’s stock price during that  time. We needed 10-15 years for cost to come down to allow for these  innovations to take off.   Nokia is  at the center of all these innovations because of their role as a  network infrastructure equipment manufacturer. And, currently it is  being treated as having similar valuation as Dollarma ($TSX) which is a  retail chain of dollar stores.        Fundamental Analysis                                                   Technical Analysis          Log Long Term Chart  Last week’s volume was the highest single day volume in the company’s history before they bloody banned $NOK from trading.

GME - Restrictions lifted, and brought in 3 times with 45 mins - HOLD FELLOW RETARDS!
While it's been a batshit week, fundamentals are still sound - shorts are still heavy, we've seen shit pushed in the media about how WSB is moving to Silver, we've seen the manipulation from the big players, AND STILL, 45 mins into markets opening and "restrictions lifted"..... restrictions have been back in place 3 times already today.  This isn't just a one off, this is Wall Street and Hedge Funds using their contacts and vested interests at the platforms to try and trick us into panicking.  KEEP CALM EVERYONE, AND HOLD. THEY'RE MANIPULATING THE MARKET, SO MAKE THEM FUCKING BLEEEEEEED!!!!!!!!  WE WILL WIN THIS!
Do you keep spreadsheets tracking your stonks in excel?
If so, how?
Bought at $320, $240, and $54 and I have no plans of selling
🗣 BUY 🗣 THE 🗣 DIPS
HOLD like your balls depend on it, i know i am, you can too!
I saw another post here saying I could get free karma here. Got in a little late but diamond hands   🏻
STOP FUCKING SELLING RETARDS
I put my whole lifesavings in this. Dont fucking sell
Hey can anyone let me know which 1 week chart is AMC and which is GME?
WE CAN DO ITTT. BUY AND HOOOOLLLDDD
COME ON GUYS DONT GIVE UPPPP WE GOT THIS
I'm actually retarded and didn't buy the dip
Don't be like me
This is called a "Dip", do you guys know what we do when GME dips? YOU BUY BUY BUY
Can anyone explain why the buy vs sell ratio isnt reflected in the GME price?
All week there has been significantly more "buy" than "sell"  the price was dropping all week.  This morning, for the first time since i've been looking at it, "sell" is greater than "buy"  the price was soaring.     Please use simple words to   dumber than a bag of hammers.  Pos: 16 GME @ 167
Goal for today: GME closing price above $100
Just to make sure everyone knows what big steps can be taken today. If we close above $100 today we are able to make it the HF’s difficult. It doesn’t need to go to the moon today, just hope it will close above $100. HOLD and wait how it will open on monday.
reporting for duty.
A bunch of you paper hand retards saw a $20 bump and sold.
If you hold the fuckin line, today could be dope as fuck.
The power of GME 69 is with us. Let’s take it to 420!
I’m only referring to sex and weed not stocks I’m not a financial advisor.
Bought 0dte $150 GME Calls
Saying goodbye to my portfolio unless you apes can pull this off.
Options Pricing
EDIT: THANK YOU all for clearing up that it's Implied Volatility.  Now maybe this poor monkey can get some tendies T\_T  See below, but for some reason the options prices on GME options are through the freaking roof.  Are the market makers playing a game with us, basically restricting options trading only to people that can afford $3,000+ per contract, even on ones that expire same month?     For comparison's sake, here's options prices on Garmin (GRMN) with almost double the stock price, yet the options are still relatively affordable for those of us that can't/won't spend $3,000 per contract :-\\
Getting real sick of all the lies from news articles.
I know I'm not the only one I am really starting to get pissed off about all the damn news articles trying to destroy this subreddit because they can't handle what the summer has done to their corporate Masters.
🤔🤔🤔
HOLD THE LINE.
We are going to the moon. Don’t let the paperhands convince you otherwise. They are just upset that they folded like they always do. Apes strong together!!
Markets have only been open for 50 minutes. Relax.
It doesn't matter that GME is up right now. There's still 5 and a half hours left in the day, so it's probably a  little  optimistic to say that "It's happening."      Hold. Have some tea. It's not even worth thinking about until it's 115% certain that the squeeze is being squoze.
Thanks for everyone who is holding
we really need gamestop and i just wanna say thanks because without gamestop i would definitely be living a different life.
Bot posts are among us (FUD at play)
Guys we know shits going down today when the forum has been flooded with FUD bots trying to reasonably suggest selling. It's so fucking crystal clear they are fakes.   Hedge funds would only go to so much trouble if they were fucked.   LETS GOOOOOOO                 Edit: position 17 @ $34 and HOLDING
Just bought 10 more shares at a DISCOUNT! HOLD!!
<3 u   🤝
[CREDIT TO u/2am_spaghetti] Please, I've figured out the situation and can't post it to WSB
ALL CREDIT GOES TO      FINAL EDIT: Toning down the Rhetoric. We need real data, can this be mathed out? I like that guys idea of a shareholder meeting. GET THESE FUCKS IN JAIL. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.    ALLEGATION: SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL  Let's roleplay, retards. I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.  I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death. Here's my plan.  I collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME. This happens. I don't know how, but keep going with me.  So now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME shares out of my account, or the jig is up. They'd be caught as a FAIL TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one. So how do I never sell one of these? Shorting!  But no no guys... not just regular shorting. We... we would short. EVERY. TRANSACTION. EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY. It's more important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the market and get found out. Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of intercepting magic.  So, we do this for a while. Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a couple go. Well, let's wait and see what happens.  < INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME >    Oh, shit. Things are warming up. People think Gamestop might really come back. If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5 million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it from my account.  Oh, shit. It happened. A lot. Look at those fail to delivers. They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.  The jig is up.  I don't want to get caught, so I hit my "omfg algorithm" button, that will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of those buy orders for GME. I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.  They decided "FUCK IT" eventually, and traded in their   FAKE SHARES   for   REAL MONEY   at some point during this, and those are   FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS  . THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS,   SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.    THOSE ARE FAKE SHARES, "CREATED" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD HAVE COME IN FOR THEM. AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION   AND     ~~ITS NOT JUST~~     MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP. \[Edited, im retarded\]    ===========================================================  please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler  Their stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole portfolio. The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.     Imagine using your car jack while the handle is twisted open. No pressure, fluid is just movin around. Even in this state, sometimes if you pump it fast enough you can see little jumps of life. The real solution though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.  Visualize their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in which case it EXPLODES. We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k bids being filled right before everything shut down. But in this waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment they overshorted, and it remains. Its why they didnt bail at 20, or 80, or 115. THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME > FLOAT. This was the math all along.  This also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine this pool.    TLDR:   The mathematical strategy of the situation is to   reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)  , and   grow the maximum red force (additive).    We have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of red, quickly. If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE. IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.  Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally -   THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK  , and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT   AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL    This theory connects the dots.    Please if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read. Ive been trying via modmail, posts, everything. Anyone with a platform needs to know this. Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.    EDIT2: omg melvin is so sinister. They knew redditors would bandwagon. They are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME. PLEASE HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.  EDIT:                              Again, credit to   u/2am_spaghetti for this post.
Got in yesterday with 2@57$ GME
NOT FUCKING SELLING UNTIL WE HIT ALPHA CENTAURI LET'S GOO!!      🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕
Trading stops
So, as the general smooth brain I am. I have a query/theory/discussion to be had here-y.  The fact that GME gets halted when it soars, but when it fell like a stone it wasn’t stopped at all, surely shows that the manipulation is rife, correct?
KRAMER IS CRYING ON CNBC
LOL Cramer is crying because Gamestop hasn't addressed the stock situation in a press realease he's calling for the SEC to call them up LOL. His Hedge buddies are scared!
Relax, its not launch date, just weekly banana day
Take this as a moral boost that everyone is holding.  All the apes got their alotment of bananas from the zookeeper today and flinging it at GME.

T212 closed my pending orders, so I bought double. Still holding
DIAMOND HANDS ARE STEADY, NOT GONE APESHIT
I know going full apeshit is really tempting, but hear me out.  GME is literally skyrocketing out of our screens into our hearts, but don't get swooned by this. The market is EXTREMELY volatile, and this goes  both ways .   Don't go apeshit and throw your life savings into GME, it may very well drop as hard as it increased within seconds. Hold what you have, buy what you can afford to lose. We'll get there, but it's still the long run and we have to stay steady.  I love you all, stay safe, keep those diamond hands steady. Don't go apeshit, trust in your fellow retard.  Edit: Also, I genuinely believe we will make it, but there's still a small chance the hedge funds will prevail and we won't get a second squeeze. Even if we don't win right now, hold onto your stocks. GameStop is going through a huge transformation right now, and I genuinely believe the stock will increase in worth over the years. Playing the long run doesn't cost you anything extra, and I genuinely believe that when I pass my stocks to my grandchildren, they will be rich assholes and spend all the GME money on some good games.
Here we go bros!
Im brewing a Irish Red Ale today. But all I see is green BABY!!!!! Lets gooo

Hahahahahhaha I TOLD YOU. ALL OF YOU AUTISTS I SAID IT WILL ROCKET BACK UP AGAIN. $GME
Stupid retarded ape monkey baboon creatures, if you listened to me on my post yesterday you would've bought at the dip from the short ladder attack, you would've bought at $50 A SHARE LOLOL.   Now you're sharting in your little ape boxers and you're scared to enter in because the price is rising, seriously its not too late to buy, all you need to do if you wanna make bank is BUY AND HOLD. BUY ALL DIPS AND HOLD  goodafternoon, goodevening and goodnight.    (Not financial advise) i take all my financial advice from my wifes boyfriend, hes got a cool car from stonks.

Amc volume at 87 million alread, strap in. Gonna be a hell of a day for apes!
WTF is going on google finance took off my watch list (GME and AMC)
I'm still holding GME and didn't think it would get back up to $80
This group has started to get so negative.  If you have hope that the stock could rise again everyone would start to tell you you're a loser for not selling.  I started to feel like there was no chance of It rising anymore no matter how much money we kept putting in.  I haven't sold any of my shares and I bought some at $50 and now that it's back to $80 I know there's potential that we can win this.  If it drops back down again I'm buying more but the fact that it went up at all today tells me I need to hold my shares until we really reach the moon
Why the halt?
What happened?
In4 more. 7 @ 203 avg now down from 317 avg. am I doing it right retards?
Short banks
Short anything holding student debt? Wouldn't this be like shorting housing in 2008? If those loans are forgiven what happens to the banks that hold the paper?
It's very nice seeing all this optimism make it's way back. LET'S GO GME! DON'T LET THEM PAY US BACK!

I LIKE THIS STOCK!!!
Now I really need a financial advice. It's not that much fun to be a retard after all.
I've invested $17k averaging $150. The value of my   shares are about $9200 at the time I'm writing this post. I'm still holding. What should I do?
Amc and Gme
It’s crazy to me that these two stocks literally have the same exact chart. Like exactly the same. I dont know what to say except I’m holding lol
Hey Guys, I sold my 1 share at 400$ of GME at a %85+ Loss.... :(
But bought back my share at 58$! You cant be psychologically stressed if you don't see that BIG red loss on your account.     Edit; pls note I don't have extra $$ to buy more an average down

I freaking love AMC and GME🤩
BUY those AMC DIPS
C’mon guys we need to push this... stay strong, YOLO!
I sold and it feels good...
Feels good to be done with this nonsense.  Took the loss, sold and bought Ford and Canopy Cannabis...  I hope GME goes to the moon for you guys.
BUY FUCKING MORE
KEEP BUYING AND HOLD YOU RETARDED APES. DONT GIVE UP
Hold the line. Do not sell to buy dips. Just average down if you need to.
GME - If you're up, don't be greedy
If you're up $1 or $100, don't be greedy. It's only profit when you sell. It's only loss when you sell. I tend to feel better about selling at a profit than a loss.
Squeeze havent been squoze Valhalla is still Virgin

WHO IS HOLDING THE GME MOON WITH ME  🙋‍♂️
Robinhood stole $700 from me and added $200 account deficit
Has this happened to anyone else? I'll go over some details. $1400 in robinhood, $700 cash, the rest in shares. After this bullshit last week I decided to switch brokerages. I transfered $700 to Webull, didn't work. So I transfered to my bank account, then to Webull. No problem.   This morning I woke up to a $200 deficit, which is impossible because I sold off $700 shares yesterday. Now that $700 is gone and I owe them $200. I can't reach a customer service number, and email isn't working. Wtf  Fuck robinhood, anyone else experience something similar?
For all the    telling us to sell and its over, I haven't seen a single    position posted
Where are the puts? Where is the gain porn from buying puts at 350?  Further evidence that the    among us were sent by the hedgehogs 🐷
GME so special it's cat bounced twice!
Buy on the dips
Just bought 11 more shares!!!  Let’s do this
TODAY IS THE DAY! Restrictions are lifted we have momentum. BUY GME
Bought most from my other brokers but figured I would stick it back to RobinHood. Used instant transfer to buy the dip. Don’t even have the 10k in my account. Just did it to hold the fucking line. YOLO

Imagine holding at 90 but...
Selling at 70.    You earn your losses in this life.
GME! Set your sell orders really high so they can't borrow your shares!
See title! Let's make this happen as a community!  If you can't set if really high just keep changing the sell order higher as the price rises.
Holding alone won't do anything
It's pretty obvious that holding won't do anything as many institutions and non-wsb members are selling out.
DO NOT SELL GME!!!
WE ARE DIAMOND HANDS WE ARE NOT PAPER... paper burns diamonds do not...
JUST GOT 9 MORE SHARES EVERYONE LETS DO THIS!!!!!!!
To the moon and beyond my fellow smooth brains! 💸💸💸
People who panic sold yesterday watching GME this morning
DON'T PANIC SELL IF GME IS HALTED!
if you are new and you never experienced something like that don't panic!!! it's something that happen, it will recover after a couple of minutes, just don't panic otherwise when it is back the price will be lower!  stay calm and see you on the moon!        Edit: I used few words just to explain the concept, if you wanna learn more, google is your friend

Before you beg for advice here, you can answer your own questions.
I see a bunch of noobs coming in here, all the time, asking the same questions,  "Should I buy it??" "Do I keep holding??"  And it's honestly kinda making this place annoying lol. Should you buy it?  I don't know, do you want to and can you afford to?  Most of these questions posted have simple answers, that if you're wondering these things, you can literally give yourself the answer. Decide if you can financially afford it, don't invest what you can't lose. Easy.  Do you hold? Yes retard.   Obviously. Who the fuck buys a stock to sell at a loss? It seems pretty unlikely that a stock NEVER goes back up again. Chances are, it goes back up.   Do we know when? No, because we're not fucking fortune tellers.  This is Wall Street BETS. If you're looking for guarantees, easy money, and safety, you're in the wrong place. And please stop spamming us with your noob questions. Do your own due diligence. Research. Figure it out.
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR: A CHANCE TO ADDRESS AND AMEND
Hi lads, just wanted to air something bout here.   This isn't a post about numbers and patterns and trades as such. In my opinion, when you're up against a behemoth like major hedgefunds, it's essential that we don't all stray and move apart like lost lambs. Our strength here comes from more than just the size of your portfolio, it's supposed to be a community.   The last 2 weeks, this place has been toxic. We've slated one another (I'm as guilty as the next man) been unsupportive of those who came out unscathed from these incredibly volitile movement's in the market, and just generally been dickheads to one another.   This goes against where our strengths are. It's counter productive.   We need to step up and instead of acting like  bunch of individuals, start acting as a single entity again.   People have been attracted to these shares because of the obvious strength we have in numbers but everytime we shit on somebody when they share a different opinion to us, it brings us all down. If we can't have anything somewhat decent to say, just be civil back.   We spread by word of mouth, people invest because their friends invested because one person found the shares on WSB of Interest. Right now, we're apes just throwing shit at each other and it's starting to show.   I invested in AMC, friends invested in GME. Others invested elsewhere. We're already spread thinner than we should be. Can we just be something a little bit more than self riotous cunts for a week to see where this can actually go.   We've been told countless times that holding is key. But for those of us holding, you don't have to a dick when someone decides to get out.   I still believe that as a collective we have so much potential but only as a group, not shit slinging individual apes.
Why should anyone [especially paper handed goofballs] get to fuck with your emotions? We are     and we hold TOGETHER. THEIR FOMO WILL BE REAL.
None of this is financial advice but I LIKE THE STOCK AND IM THROWING MORE IN LEADING UP TO BIG MONDAY LETS GET IT. KEEP THE MOMENTUM GME AMC
Help me learn something about stocks I’m dumb
I’m dumb so someone has to teach me about stocks
My brother shared this to make fun of me for holding on to GME. I told him I’d be happy to have Big Bird represent GME at a meeting of the fortune 500 companies, at least he’d look good.
Need a $10k spot
I figured with all the buying, holding, and substantial unrealized losses I’ve seen here, would a drop in the bucket if someone could spot me $10k to get back in the game.   Used to trade heavily about 5 years ago and been on a hiatus. Of course I will gladly pay back the principle after a few successful trades.    Could make for an interesting story if anyone is up to it.  PM me if your interested.

This is not financial advice    We should never forget last weeks shenanigans. Robinhood has been eyeing a 2021 IPO for a while now. They might just push it back to 2022 hoping we all forget.

A lot of confusion regarding $GME
First of all, I am not a financial advisor, but a retard with a few $300+ shares, don’t listen to me.   I have seen a lot of mixed emotions about the state of the stock right now. Some true autists are still holding on to hope of the MOASS, while others are adamant that it has sqozen. Wherever you stand on this stock, if you have been here for more than a month, you cannot deny that there has been a massive shift in WSB. Granted, bots can be thanked for some of this, but there are a lot of new users who think this is a place for P&D schemes or “fighting the system”.  At its core, WSB is a collection of retards who sometimes hit the green button at the right time and make “cRaZy gAiNz”, but mostly just post about the money they lost on an insane YOLO. WSB is NOT here to tell you the “next miracle stock”.   I am all for growing the community, but I can’t say I am a fan of what the sub is becoming Thank you to the mods who care about keeping the community and aren’t just in it for money.   Also, FUCK SHORTY, FUCK THE SEC, and HOLD (because you like the stock)
Loss porn but a healthy reminder, only buy what you can afford to lose.
What stock should we run up today?
I'm one of the people who bought $GME for around $350 and I refuse to sell at a loss. Diamond Hands or Lose it all

Reasons why GME is still going to fucking Pluto.
List of reasons to buy more GME:  1.) We are going to know the short interest on Tuesday and I believe that it went up exponentially considering we still haven't squeezed.  2.) The media just days ago said that we were "all in" on silver which is owned by Melvin and his whores. The news was literally geared against us and lied about the direction of the subreddit intentionally.  3.) The entire sub was sure that the squeeze hadn't happened until we got warnings from previous mods here that the sub was going to be monetized and that our reliable mod team up until that point was now being replaced.  4.) Robinhood literally did straight up illegal shit  and manipulated the market so that people couldn't buy for days. Robinhood is going to lose a metric shit ton of money for this move and wouldn't have done it unless Melvin was completely fucked.  5.)     Gabriel  Plotkin's (founder of Melvin Capital) wife literally filed for divorce from this motherfucker just days ago as he was getting his asshole collectively gaped by us apes. Shits personal now dude will do whatever he has to do to fuck us (I would) he lost a FORTUNE.  6.) We have post confirming that there are fresh account bots manipulating our opinion on here and trying to get us to sell and waiver (its working).  7.) Financial institutions have been confirmed to be jacked to the tits in GME 800c 3/19 calls. These motherfuckers know what they are doing.  8.) Apes together strong and suddenly we're all paper handed bitches? I don't buy it.  9.) The chart similarities between GME and other BANG stocks are uncanny and show clear manipulation.  10.) MOST IMPORTANTLY Janet Yellen told me the squeeze was happening next week, jerked me off yesterday, and kissed the tip.  HOLD THE LINE YOU APES THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. I like the fucking stonk love this community and this is just my opinion except for the part about Janet giving me sloppy toppy and jerking me off chimp style with her feet. Any more reasons you guys can think of why its still a good idea to invest?  Mods deleted this and stated no reason proving #6 and #3

FOR EVERYONE WORRIED ABOUT THE SQUEEZE WE CAN LITERALLY START IT ON MONDAY/TUESDAY BY DOING THIS👇
Get a load of how fucking easy this is about to be  Everyone needs to email GameStop and ask for an Emergency Shareholder Vote and a Reverse Stock Split   This is the investor relations email for GameStop, email them telling them your full name, the country you're based in, and the number of shares you own and request an Emergency Shareholder Vote and a Reverse Stock Split. An Emergency Shareholder Vote would mean eliminating all synthetic stock and taking leverage away from short-sales and a Reverse Stock Split would cause Citadel and any other phantom shares creators to be stuck holding their losses on their shorts position. This is the quickest way to help end this situation once and for all.  You can do this using the template below created by u/Whiplash51  Subject : Fears of potential securities fraud  Hello,  My name is  --  --, I am located in  -- and I currently own  -- shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.  Thank you for your time,  (your name)     Full disclosure, I didn't come up with this idea, credit goes to both u/gnadami and u/Precocious_Kid for it, I'm just reposting with a template to help spread awareness about this and get more people in on it.  EDIT: I've updated the post to include the template created by u/Whiplash51 since I think it sounds a lot more professional, additionally, u/canadian-brasilian suggests that we contact the largest shareholder of the company to ask them to call back all the short stocks. The largest shareholder is Fidelity Investments and you can contact them via their form linked below:     And for anyone wondering what the logic behind all this is, here's an article courtesy of u/johnjacobbtc explaining naked shorts, how they can be manipulated, and how a reverse split stock can help solve this issue. Read the paragraphs "Naked manipulation" and "Where Naked Shorts Go to Die" -    EDIT 2: So apparently the email has been down for some people so here's an additional   you can sign created by u/confusedmongoosifer

Serious Story Time: Put all my life savings into GME at ~ $250 and my wife has now just said she is filing for divorce
Divorcing me because I suggested selling today. We holding this now boys. Diamond hands is helping the Diamond stay on her finger.   TLDR; Holding GME is saving my marriage. Me and my wife will see all of you guys on the moon
After transfering from Robinhood to Fidelity I noticed not all of my stocks or my cash balance was transfered causing a negative account value with Fidelity. This is what they told me.
Would it be illegal if Melvin Capital was lying?
If we find out on the 9th that they were not out of their short position on the 31st of January, will it have been illegal market manipulation or something for them to have been telling the media that they were out?
Couldn’t get a billboard so I did the next best thing!
GME should turn unused games into video arcade systems for AMC and they should work together to host an international gaming competition every year on the big screen projectors and weekly regional tournaments in all AMC theaters.
Each AMC should have an arcade room that has a projector for daily tournaments and the walls are lines with side by side arcade games.
You are here.
I'm convinced we're living in a simulation at this point.

To all of the "intelligent investors" criticizing GME apes for doubling down
You're just not retarded enough to hang with us. Mathematically, it  only  makes sense at this point to double down. It's the only winning play. Here's why:  You're an ape who bought 10 shares of GME at $360. You spent $3600 and then because of forces beyond our control, the goal-posts while the ball was in-flight and now the stock plummets all the way to $55 this morning.  What can you do?   1: Cut your losses - you're now out $3050  2: Double the fuck down.  This morning if you boought 305 shares of GME at $55 for $16,775 you would have broken even by EOD today. And if you paper-handed out at the high of $95 today you'd be up $15k.  But most fucking importantly, you'd now have 315 fucking shares of GME, and that alone is winning in my book.  I'm on PC, someone add some rockets in the comments section for me.
Is it wrong just to like the fact that this whole GME rollercoaster to the moon has taken my mind off of all the other shit 2020-2021 has thrown at us? It’s an expensive distraction, but I am retarded and optimistic it will pay off. 💅 💅    HOLD!

The limit sell orders for 1000 more then trippled since i set mine 2 days ago
I bought the dip  🤲
Thanks for the getting me into stocks!
Been in quarantine for the last two weeks and this whole thing has been an educational experience.  Did some reading and watched the threads and thought “that’s interesting!”  Got me a TD direct investing account and got 40 shares of GME at $105.  Learned a bunch watching the price changes and got mad when the trading halted or the other platforms restricted trading.  Either way, Ima keep them GME cause I always had fun at the EB Games back in the day!   Cheers,  One of the new guys.
The WSB sub we knew and loved is dead
On various accounts I've been on WSB since like 100k members and now after the GME thing we have people complaining about the word retard we have people asking why they can't sell thier shares at 5pm for God's sake we can't even use the word c ck anymore I wish the mods put the sub on private and kept it this way after the 2 million mark and opened it back after this GME shit blew over we also can't talk about anything other then fuckin GME or we get down voted most of yall are unironicly RETARDED
To everyone thinking about paper hands, read this.
See the indicators, don't give up.  It's a solid bet even without the chance of payoff.  Diamond Hands win the Rocket Ride!
🤲
I paper hands my gme yesterday selling @51 after buying @100. I realized that I'm not built for high volitilty trading. More of a stick some money in "safe"  stocks (Microsoft, Nvidia, DocuSign) and leave it there. Of course all the trades I completed where within my risk tolerance . I do really hope that everything works out for those still holding and that the squeeze has not been squoze. I think I'll also be leaving the sub because this it is built around very high risk high rewards trades and does not fit my boring style of investing. But this sub did get me to start investing again which I do appreciate so from one retard to another thank you and I hope you all stay stronger than me.   🤲        👨‍👨‍👧‍👧💪
Something is going to happen early next week at that point of inflection. If it’s tits up or tits down, then i love tits
What exactly happened at 10:00 AM to cause that surge?
Unfortunately, during the one window I decided to take a shower this morning, there was the immediate spike and decline of GME. That could have erased by >$10,000 deficit, and I would've actually made a little profit in the process.  It seemed a bit unnatural. Is that hedges unloading a slight bit of their squeeze at that moment? Hopefully it wasn't the rest of it, heh.  What  did  seem to be the case is it occurred shortly after we hit underneath $50. I'll have to look out for that again if that ever occurs.
For those that're saying "close your positions", you've got it bass-aackwards.
Nice try with the dis-information..  Closing a position basically means closing the circuit on whatever type of transaction you're making with a brokerage with its' opposite.  Most commonly:  1. Selling if you bought a stock. 2. Buying back a stock if you short sold. 3. Cancelling an order that you placed with limits.     TL;DR: You'll always have an open position until you sell your st nk(s). This is nothing to fear and is perfectly normal. Once you've bought (with a cash account), you're fine. Margin is a whole 'nother animal. Stick to a cash account, trust me.  Reference:           "Fly you fools!" - Gandalf    Not financial advice, just another m nkey in the barrel. I like my st nk, thank you very much.

GME: Today's Action & Long Term for us Holders of Bag (Positive Summary)
While a current or near-term short squeeze is unknown until around February 9, it is well known that GME is really not trading on squeeze speculation any longer.   So we fell back to trading on a combination of actual company potential VS "What IS the right value?" rather than ONLY squeeze speculation.  This is great for us.  GME was never a bad LONG TERM PLAY.  It was an INVESTMENT rather than just a PLAY or a spec.  The movement up today indicates to me a longer term sentiment with a SQUEEZE POTENTIAL bonus.  I would say the movement today is 75% price equilibrium + 25% squeeze sentiment.  Im sure there will be more bad days, but if the stocks current value of   represents 75% value and 25% squeeze sentiment then that means the actual value would be around $    Not terrible.  It could be $   What do you imagine will happen when GME comes out with some positive news? DEMAND.  Us BAG HOLDERS are also cream of crop of holders right now after just losing our shit 50-90%.   If your holding now, your officially a diamond handed smooth brain.   DEMAND WILL RISE AGAIN.    When your at the bottom there's always room to move up.    In all reality, it seems like DD'ers believed this was an investment rather than JUST a SQUEEZE SPEC.  That STILL applies.   Dont get all fucked up, okay?  I mean, whatever I have to tell myself to feel better right?
Can we put a stop to posts that break the rules of the Sub? They need to be banned.
Looks like there is No in order here and we have people like this idiot posting useless content and no following the rules as well.  See the idiot u/nomad79 as an example below.
GME on Russel Brand YouTube channel. UK audience likely to get 100K+ views in days. Don’t be fooled by bots or the media, we have many people around the world holding with us. The share price will be a reward for those who take part, once the HFs lose. 🌎

GME question
I have absolutely ZERO experience in any of this. I had a robinhood acct from when my friend talked me into it.  I just bought $5 of a partial share. If the stock absolutely craps its pants, all I lose is my $5, correct?
I think the hedge funds should hire me
Every time I buy more GME the price drops. I’m a really valuable psychic asset.
There is a suspicious amount of posts mocking people and saying to sell. What difference does it make if you sell now? None who cares about 50 dollars? No one. So most people will probably hold, yet they're being encouraged to sell...

Upcoming hearing has numerous industry insiders but only ONE person representing Reddit?!
How is this supposed to be a fair hearing, when there are all these industry insiders, but only 1 person representing Reddit?    From The Hill (link below):  "The Financial Services hearing, set for Feb. 18, will be split into two panels: one featuring government and industry investment regulators, and the other focused on the businesses and investors central to last week's stock market chaos.   The tentative plan for the hearing is not locked in yet, but would begin with a panel including representatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the securities industry's self-funded internal regulator; and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp. (DTCC), the clearing house used by Robinhood to finalize stock transactions conducted on its platform.   A second panel would include Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, representatives from financial industry trade groups, and a Reddit executive."  Source:

Bigger Shortsqueeze incoming?
First of that is no advice and I have no evidenz.  Maybe the last week was just bought time to short again, just with new money that first of had to become liquid.   Lets say the first short was 50$->15$= 35$ win  But a new short would mean up to 400$-> 15$  That would mean shorting became a lot more lucrative and the ods of falling GME stocks is extremly hight...

GME SHORT SQUEEZE INCOMING
Does it cost Robinhood more in the long run if I close my account or keep it open with .01
Sure there is the fact Robinhood will be about to brag about "X amount of registered users on our platform" but at the same time how much does it cost them to maintain an account over time? If they have 100k accounts all with under .10 in them wouldn't that add up to costing the company in the long run? I'm sure at some point they would make a push of "add money or lose your account" at which point they can have my damn penny.
A pattern at market close
Here we go, I have been watching the market close percentages and like clockwork, gamestop drops continuously after market close, which means the hedges are making moves while nobody else can. This is unfair, and it's not only that one but look at BB or AMC. And many others, I may be a total retard Ape, but why is this allowed?
Hold Strong!

Please don’t laugh me out of here. I’m looking to dip my toe in and see if I become addicted to trading. I’m looking to spend a small amount, $500 or so to begin with and go from there. Any ideas for good stocks that may let me buy in partial shares as an option as well?
How long do we have to hold? from the videos I've been watching with each passing day always mention it gets worse for the hedge funds the longer we hold, but all they do is double, triple, quadruple down.
But i don't really understand the math on why they would risk infinite losses when all we lose in what we've invested.  so you apes. how long do think the hedge funds can last?
Can I call you Reddit-Activism-Traders? Whether you're RATs or monkeys it's a giant lab.
That's why I sat out the activism trading going on. I sold my $RIG and I'll probably play it again in two months. All I see is $GME and $AMC and I fear that unknown a market. I can't pull the trigger.
SIX HEDGE FUNDS AND NINE BROKERS ADDED TO ROBINHOOD CLASS ACTION
The various brokers and hedge funds allegedly conspired together to knowingly deprive retail investors of the ability to invest in the open market during an unprecedented stock rise, in order to benefit the hedge fund companies, such as Citadel, Melvin Capital, and Maple Lane Capital. The lawsuit alleges that the online brokers involved froze the everyday investors out to enable the hedge funds to stop losing money when the stocks rose in value.  The lawsuit continues to allege that Robinhood and nine other online brokers failed to provide duty of care to their customers and that they purposefully harmed their customers positions in GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) and twelve other stocks, such as Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE: AMC), Nokia Oyj (NYSE: NOK), K055 Corporation (NYSE: redacted), and nak3d Brand Group Ltd (NYSE: redacted). The lawsuit is also alleging that Robinhood was recently fined $  by the SEC, and a monitor has been assigned to watch their activities closely.  This class action is the first and only one to include all six hedge funds, all ten brokers, and all thirteen stocks.  The case is 3:21-cv-00167, Nordeen et al v. Robinhood Financial LLC et al.  The plaintiffs are represented by the Law Offices of Gary R Carlin APC, a Long Beach based law firm.  If you have suffered losses or damages related to this event and would like to join the class action, or if you have any questions, please contact the Law Offices of Gary R Carlin APC by e-mail at   or through their website at:    Get ya money ya filthy apes!

GME: Where are we right now?
Guys I’m going to admit I’ve been losing confidence in GME lately... you might not like what I’m going to have to say and you can all downvote this if you want but I don’t  care because I just want to get a perspective out that I think could have some merit to it and y’all’s response to “where are we right now?”.   Last week we saw a large rise in buy volume on the charts for GME stock that took it all the way to mid $300s to almost $400s but all the while it  only took like a weekend for it to all disappear. Now GME is in the $50 to $60 range and has been fighting for its price tag. This morning looked like we had day traders do a mini pump and and dump. As much as I want to believe this  movement started as a good cause of short squeezing a hedge fund I don’t know anymore where this stock is headed without whichever big funders’ who pumped and dumped our stock. I feel like they got greedy and left with what they put in and some of our money.   I know pump and  dump is a strong accusation but it feels and looks like that’s what happened on the volume sheets and charts. I think someone saw this as as a disguised opportunity to plus off newbie or inexperienced investors who saw a  day trade of a stock(which it obviously didn’t turn out to be) or a explosive stock by the end of a week. It’s been 2 weeks, and we’re now nearing the end of the second week with no sign of these big investors who pulled out on us reinvesting to bring the stock price up again. Consequently, we’ve been left “holding the line” and there haven’t been many positive changes to our stock price despite trading platforms removing restrictions on GME which I thought would reverse the downward trend. I admit I feel betrayed, angry, upset, and very discouraged not only for myself but for you all who believe in this reviving. Maybe it might? Maybe it won’t?  I just know I don’t want anyone else of us suffering more losses than we can afford. However, I know we’re still costing short investors billions and maybe that’s all we can hope for at the moment. But guys I’m just saying it like I see it. Things aren’t always what they seem and I don’t know what the game plan is that’ll make us our money back which feels like a long shot without more help. Conclusively, As far as I know, I don’t really see this going anywhere else from its stagnant spot except with more help.   So I ask you guys: Where do you realistically see this stock going? And why?  Update: What’s y’all’s take on AMC? I see potential in that stock as it’s price will naturally(not artificially) rise due to demand once people stop worrying about COVID restrictions.
What if GME leverages their deep relationships within the gaming industry and goes into the game hosting business with their CTO from AWS leading the way? This could turn their entire business model on its head. ☁️☁️☁️        just bought 3 more GME @ 65
It's About the Journey not About the Destination
Hello, relatively new ape here. I've always lurked here for the meme but this is my first time participating. I have lost >$2000 and couldn't be happier. Being a part of this community and part of this meme is wonderful. To sound cliche as fuck, it's about the journey, not the destination, and this journey is quite the entertaining one.   However, we are reaching the destination gentlemen. GME TO THE MOON! I HAVE 55 SHARES AT $97 AVERAGE AND IM HOLDING. HOLD WITH ME MY BROTHERS. WE GOT THIS SHIT DONT GIVE IN NOW. THE JOURNEY IS ENJOYABLE BUT SO IS THE DESTINATION. WE ARE GOING TO SPACE BABY SEE YOU AT $1000 YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS.    🤲   As Gandhi once said: Do something with love or never do it at all. I love you diamond handed apes. Let's see this shit through - TOGETHER! APES TOGETHER STRONG.
I’ll fuckin do it again

Still room for one more retard?
Hedgies are trying to take credit for this movement and make themselves look good. I’m aware that hedge funds were definitely going into GameStop but this is far from the truth
Moon      or 0. Still here, still holding. Have a good weekend crayon eaters.
MOVE YOUR SHARES FROM BROKERAGE/MARGIN ACCOUNT TO A CASH ACCOUNT
Lots of $GME is currently held in brokerage accounts. THAT MEANS YOUR BROKER CAN LEND IT TO SHORTS.  And since short interest is so high, any share they  can  lend, they probably have already. (Recently I heard the brokers had actually run out of shares to lend, showing how high the short interest is.)  If you transfer your share into a CASH ACCOUNT then the broker can no longer lend it. And if it's already lent out and the broker doesn't have unlent shares in other margin accounts (which they probably don't, considering they recently ran out of shares to loan) they will RECALL THE SHARE from the short and force them to cover at market price! If we all do this, it could force a massive volume of forced buying, sending prices to the moon as brokers are suddenly calling up shorts saying "We need that share NOW" and a wall of apes is charging moon prices for those shares.  Cash accounts vs margin/brokerage accounts info:  .  Anyway, even if we can't get enough people to move that we actually hit that "forced cover" threshold, the less shares the brokers have to loan, the higher interest rate they will charge the short interests. That gives us extra pressure (by increasing how much the hedges are bleeding on their nightly interest payment) that will motivate them to close at higher prices.  I don't know if I even need to say it, but while your shares are being transferred between accounts you probably won't be able to sell them. But you weren't gonna sell anyway, 'cause MAMA DIDN'T RAISE NO BITCH!!  Another squeeze is incoming if we can get enough apes to move their shares out of those margin accounts into cash accounts!    tl;dr: moving our shares from brokerage accounts to cash accounts      en masse      would squeeze the shorts and force them to cover at any cost (as well as increasing their interest payments.)          This is not financial advice, I just started learning about this stuff recently.
Made a last one in time. Y'all know what time it is. I don't know emoji . But all I do is hold shit in. I'm retarded.
We never left 🤡🤡🤡
GME up 20+% today!

SELL GME
don't come crying to this sub when you realize that there isnt going to be some mystical "big squeeze" and realize you're mindlessly pouring money into this stock
looking for a better lemon to squeeze?
Those hedge fund bastards just bought puts on a stock you've heard of. HEAR ME OUT. yes that company has been dead forever but THATS what makes it so funny. and memestocks aren't just about being funny, they're about making money.   So.... I just sunk everything into this stock. HOw MucH? you ask?!  enough. plenty.   yesterday was a hard day. for everyone. for people holding GME / AMC but also for people not holding GME... if they had a heart. no, the hedgies didn't lose. the middle class who believed in 🤙   did. some, lost big.  and everyone who isn't a sociopath shared the pain when we heard the stories of the losses.   but we can't forget. the comedy united us. and THIS GROUP squeezed that stock and had the time of their lives doing it. and we don't want to lose that momentum now, do we? and to the people holding GME still, who bought at the top. I'm sorry 🥺 but you already took that ride down, so you already are holding the bag. the stock may have an unprecedented second fomo bull run, but many scholars would say thats improbable. and there's most likely more deflating to do with GmE/amc because of the extreme volitility it just experienced upward.  so you may be wondering   what's the next funny meme stock?   bb? nok? no... those jokes aren't funny anymore.   but the squeeze   hasn't even begun   being squoze  at...  gopro.   YOU APES WANNA LIVE FOREVER???!!!           ✨✨ ✨✨
To those holding GME at $300
You’re going to need roughly a 600% increase just to break even.  LMFAO  You need to come back to reality and realize that you were tricked by a frenzy of fucking morons who don’t know what they’re doing.  If you haven’t noticed, almost everyone who knows what the fuck they’re doing have already left.  Have fun bagholding
Who else is like me hoping the squeeze doesn't squooze?
Until after my next paycheck
Wtf happened here.
Went from yachts and tendies to social justice warriors. Call Martin on the Shkreli phone to clean this dumpster fire up.
GME, BB, AMC, NOK
Your one pager of dipshit dumbassness: i love these stocks. This is not advice.   They lifted restrictions and look what happened. Amazing how fickle minded people are. Loved the abuse yesterday but only because I’m into that shit.   WHAT DID WE LEARN?  We’re playing mass market psychology now. Panic induces selling-something autists and wall st has known for years. Knee jerk reaction to stop the bleeding.   Mark cuban basically explained to the world how non dividend paying stocks are basically Pokémon cards. The loudest mid on the playground screams about his charizard and its worth what WE think it is.   Fundamentals like DCF, EPS, were all an excuse to drive up price and make commissions. All supporting speculation.   Zachs and moody’s and everyone else with buy, sell ratings helped to back that, but chamath even said, you dont know what GME’s worth. You dont know what TSLA is worth.   GME could pull a Tesla.  What happened with Tesla? Nobody could explain it but here’s my theory: retail liked the stock. Some really loud kids yelled that TSLA was a shiny holographic charizard. No fundamentals and in a debt crisis. Retail Doesn’t care about that tho. They know who Elon is. They know he’s smart. They think Tesla is worth a lot. Cool. So it went to $1000. And they did a 5:1 split so every share was worth 200 and then people who didn’t get it were like damn Tesla’s  cheap again! Fear   didn’t work because retail had conviction they were right and enough people felt like they were smarter than newscasters and it was fake news to help shorts. Or they didn’t even watch news. THEY REALLY LIKED TSLA. It went back to $800.  Every fundamentalist is afraid to touch it. Shorts got burned and nobody’s talking about it because they don’t wanna admit they have no clue how to value that one. It proved Cubans point for non dividend paying shares being no different than a Michael Jordan rookie card.   The only reliable thing now is momentum and mass psychology. THERES NO REASON GME CANT PULL A TSLA.   Cohen smart too.   If they allow freedom in market retail has power.   Rh proved that today.   GME to 1000, 5:1 split. And back to $800. That’s the one scenario in which we stop thanos.   BB follows, not because short interest but because tech is good & bullish. Not a phone company anymore. Software! BB also moon  AMC - shorted to deathly bankruptcy but now has so much cash they will survive covid. Can afford a thinktank to pivot into modern trends. They wont pull a blockbuster who served as a cautionary tale of hubris. Could have bought Netflix for 17MM but got greedy.   Last but not least, NOK- elon is definitely up to something here. Idk but he seems like the kind of person with a back up plan to a back up plan. Dude loves the internet. Is epic shitlord troll (literally released models: S3XY). And he’s gotta be motivated by revenge for getting jumped on and almost having to take TSLA private.  Tinfoil hats: Tesla could acquire NOK.   What happens if you are short NOK and it gets acquired? Short HAVE to cover. Force an expiration date. Tsla buys NOK for cheap. Elon get to middle finger shorts and the SEC. TSLA led my smart genius could use Nokia’s already established 5g ready infrastructure in their cars. Not only can they honk their horn to move bitch get out the way! But also with nokias infrastructure you will be able to yell at the idiot that just cut you off through their speakers. Yeeeeeew.   If apes keep eating crayons and buying and holding tomorrow, a simple retracement could turn into a TSLA. Crazy gains and price action on Friday will blast over the weekend and monday, we have momentum. Psychology proves everybody is going to chase it.   But what do i know I’m only  🤲 and I eat crayons.
This guy lost it all on selling $GME call options
HOW WAS IT TODAY FOR YOU GUYS?
I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING
Chamath responds! $CLOV up big before close!
Anyone in Workhorse? Possible potential?
They have a “possible” contract with the Biden Admin could make it soar up to 200%.   Who has got positions?
Made shirts with diamond hands, cause I ain’t no paper handed bitch! Hold!!!!!

Chamath’s Response to the $CLOV shorts!
And that is a fact
Was one of those fouls that bought GME when it was 300+. But I am still holding.
Don’t believe the anti-hype!
With millions of new people; like myself.. you can’t assume none of them work within the hedge funds.  A loss of profit for them is unacceptable, assume the sharks in the water are capable of affecting morale, and hold, don’t be the sucker that fell for their long con, and remember if you took your money early.. it was most likely just from us,  If that’s who you want to be in this WW3 of stonks so be it; but you won’t forget..  Any battle worth fighting has its losses, but I don’t confuse that with perceived losses.  Diamonds are forever.
You wouldn't think I got into $GME under 20 bucks with my P/L, but I did... before my hands were diamonds. I really like these companies :)
You guys are going to go bankrupt.
There is no going to be some "big squeeze", It's literally just going to go down to its original value because It's a terrible stock. Artificially inflating it Isn't going to do shit lol you're all falling for a passive pyramid scheme you literally can't win against these jews who've been doing this for years and have an endless supply of money
$GME is still massively volatile, NO WAY the shorts have covered, HOLD THE LINE!
All we have to do is hold on to shares we already own, just don't sell until it's time.  It's really that simple! $GME     Stay positive, don't risk so much that you will be tempted or forced to sell.    are stronger without leverage and a good night's sleep!  edit: obviously this is not financial advice, I just really like the stock...
A friend of mine who is a true retard, used all his savings on GME. Now he is begging for money. LMAO.
Please help me, I've figured out the situation and can't post it on WSB
Crosspost from      FINAL  EDIT: Toning down the Rhetoric.  We need real data, can this be mathed  out?  I like that guys idea of a shareholder meeting.   GET THESE FUCKS  IN JAIL.  TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.    ALLEGATION:  SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL  Let's  roleplay, retards.  I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to  bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.  I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death.  Here's my plan.  I  collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my  transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME.   This  happens.  I don't know how, but keep going with me.  So  now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME  shares out of my account, or the jig is up.  They'd be caught as a FAIL  TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one.  So how do I never  sell one of these?  Shorting!  But  no no guys... not just regular shorting.    We... we would short.   EVERY.  TRANSACTION.      EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY.  It's more  important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to  boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the  market and get found out.  Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in  front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of  intercepting magic.  So,  we do this for a while.   Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't  enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a  couple go.   Well, let's wait and see what happens.  < INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME >     Oh,  shit.  Things are warming up.   People think Gamestop might really come  back.   If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5  million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it  from my account.  Oh, shit.   It happened.  A lot.   Look at those fail to delivers.   They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.  The jig is up.  I  don't want to get caught, so I hit my "omfg algorithm" button, that  will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of  those buy orders for GME.  I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll  HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.  They decided "FUCK IT" eventually, and traded in their   FAKE SHARES   for   REAL MONEY   at some point during this, and those are   FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS  .   THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS,   SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.    THOSE  ARE FAKE SHARES, "CREATED" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND  ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD  HAVE COME IN FOR THEM.   AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION   AND     ~~ITS NOT JUST~~     MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP.  \[Edited, im retarded\]    ===========================================================  please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler  Their  stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole  portfolio.  The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.     Imagine  using your car jack while the handle is twisted open.  No pressure,  fluid is just movin around.  Even in this state, sometimes if you pump  it fast enough you can see little jumps of life.  The real solution  though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.  Visualize  their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide  capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in  which case it EXPLODES.    We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k  bids being filled right before everything shut down.  But in this  waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are  out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides  where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time  to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment  they overshorted, and it remains.  Its why they didnt bail at 20, or  80, or 115.  THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME > FLOAT.    This was the math all along.  This  also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are  finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine  this pool.    TLDR:   The mathematical strategy of the situation is to   reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)  , and   grow the maximum red force (additive).    We  have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of  red, quickly.  If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the  other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS  TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE.  IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY  BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE  COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.  Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally -   THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK  ,  and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN  THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT   AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL    This theory connects the dots.    Please  if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read.  Ive  been trying via modmail, posts, everything.   Anyone with a platform  needs to know this.   Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the  profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their  ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.    EDIT2:   omg melvin is so sinister.  They knew redditors would bandwagon.  They  are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME.  PLEASE  HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.  EDIT:
WSB created a new sector, meme stocks.
I’ve seen a couple posts about “why are all these charts the same hmm?”   Let’s preface this with two things, 1. I have no idea what I’m talking about, that’s why I’m on WSB rn and 2. You’d be stupid to completely discredit foul play, Wall Street is happy to play dirty to turn a profit but right now those claims hold no real weight because screenshots of sell orders isn’t real evidence. I’m rooting for us as much as the next guy but let’s stay realistic.   Anyways onto the meme sector, a lot of the $BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) have produced the same charts because they depend on the same trends. Hype, high short interest, and mainstream media attention? Buying frenzy. Trading restrictions on $BANG, a decline in hype? Bad news for ALL meme sector stocks, they all tank together. Add on top of this the fact that many people owned more than one meme ticker and of course they all moved together, it’s the same people and they all have the same risk averse tendencies. As much as WSB > Hedgies it benefits us all to understand why these charts moving together is because the people on this sub discovered a new niche market.   I’m going back to losing money now, have a good weekend let’s make some BIG PLAYS.
HOLD IT!!!
Dude sold naked calls the night Elon tweeted
I think we're back!
This is starting to feel more like the old WSB I used to know and love.   Less conspiracy posts and people screaming and pointing fingers.  More memes and disguising devastation from financial loss with humor.  Welcome back boys.
$AMC, what are your predictions?
Things have been pretty wack today. What are your thoughts?
Can't wait to not see any of you over the weekend (I'm holding, btw.)
Y'all... We best pick it up! Looks like we might've had a wave of paperhanders buying at 50 and selling at 90. For Shame! This is worse than Melvin buying puts down from 450
We did it boys were in the inphographics show. Also I agree with this guy lmao. When you're name is Robinhood and you steal from the normal people and poor people . Ironical
Bought my first share of GameStop 🐵
Been paying attention to this shit show for a while now figured it was a good time to jump in.  THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK!
HOLD AMC
What are the predictions for the upcoming week ?

Those of you advocating to hold GME and those of you advocating it’s over are both fucking annoying
Those of you who are still holding and constantly spam every post demanding others to hold and to buy more are fucking annoying. We fucking get it, you have DiAmOnD hAnDs. Good for you, Nobody gives a shit. Most the people who are going to hold are already holding along with you. Those who are going to buy more will buy more when the time is right for them. You don’t need to constantly tell other people what to do with their money, dumbasses!   Those of you who are annoyed as fuck with those I mentioned above and have entered into a screaming match with them, are contributing to this shit. This sub is so fucking divided just like everything else in this deteriorating country. Why does there always have to be division with every fucking thing. You don’t have to reply to every single person who is still holding. Trolling is hella fun but it’s so fucking old at this point.   It’s like two factions of children are in a tantrum fight with each other to see who can be more fucking annoying. If there is a GME post, expect there to be discussions about GME. Don’t go looking to start shit if you are against holding GME. Nobody gives a shit.   If you think you should make a new post that’s similar to all the other low quality, low effort posts about holding GME or how it’s dumb as fuck, take a few seconds before submitting it to consider how fucking useless your post is and how much it contributes to the amount of shit that has been filling up this sub.   We don’t need 20+ GME posts every single fucking day. We also don’t need 20+ anti-GME posts every single fucking day.  I look forward to a day where GME is reduced to a small number of daily posts and the discussions about it are contained within them. I also look forward where we can all disagree without going at each others fucking throats.   We are all wanting to make a fuck ton of money while laughing at others massive losses along the way. Fuck this division shit and trying to convince others to do what we think they should do.   Hallelujah! Holy shit! Where's the Tylenol?
You retards are having too much fun, I want in!    🏻   #LFG!
Stand Strong Apes
A sign from my Chinese food to never give up!  These dudes started a war and I for one refuse to go down without a fight.   They have tried tried to break us down and tear us apart with their weapons. They know together we are stronger than them!  Perseverance triumphs all. We can still prevail even though they manipulated some of us into thinking the opposite.   Fuck the money, this about the principle. These lions have picked on us for far too long. It's time they see who we truly are, a gang of silverback fucking gorillas!  I'm proud of my fellow apes still holding the line next to me.  We may not be smartest. We may not be best. But we are the toughest.  This is not financial advise. These are merely words of encouragement and morale to my brothers and sisters.    I do not recommend you follow my steps unless you are a soldier and prepared for battle, win or lose.   See you apes on the other side, moon or grave!
So I dont think anyone has addressed this yet, but...
What happens if on Feb 9th we find out MC is still heavily under water? Is everyone so tired and pessimistic that they'd just let such a fat prize get away? They cant hold out on their lenders forever. I know it's a pretty big if, but noone seems to be addressing the idea that they might be wrong.   If MC has truly dug themselves out then we know the way the story goes for the people holding the bag right now, but what if it goes the other way?
The current state of GME around here
It seems like GME is hated around here for no reason.  The popular consensus seems to be that the squeeze ready happened.  EVEN THO IT HASNT YET!!!

Thanks a lot you idiots  No seriously. I didn’t get rich on GameStop, didn’t expect to (I’m down like $40, keeping my one share open kinda like a framed dollar bill on the wall at the diner).  I’ve never been a finance guy, I was an English and cultural studies major. I always wanted to get into taking control of my finances, and I did to an extent based on the regular boomer advice, but for stuff like trading i was scared off because of all the mlm hustle cult influencer bullshit. Tai Lopez and shit  Now I’m seeing that a lot of what was so confusing to me is purposely so. It made me feel like the cost of admission was out of my reach and that I’d be working shit jobs my whole life.   Now I’m looking back and realizing what I could have done sooner to build a nest egg for myself, and shit, if I took a handful of things more seriously I might not even have to work rn  But I don’t regret any of those poor financial decisions because that’s all part of the journey that brought me here today. I’ve been humbled like a mf in these two weeks though.  I’m the type of person who likes to dream of new possibilities in the world. Really wish I realized 15 years ago that I can just put money into etfs associated with things I really care about.  Anyway ape stand together. Diamond hands. Banana good. Rocket emojis
Hello fellow retards as a reward for diamond hands in $NOK, $GME and $AMC take this free pizza tendies as I do not have one near me
PSA to people here who are DOOMERS. Next Tuesday is February 9 when we get to see the Short interest rate and figure out if Melvin covered his naked shorts. THAT is when GME will rise up like an erect penis and nobody can stop it since Robin Hood has removed buying restrictions. HOLD GME UNTIL TUES!

Hold GME till Tuesday and you will see the miracle - The Oracle
The game has just begun,  The players are shuffling their cards.  Only when the cards are enough,  The dealer would show their hands.  Five of a Kind or a Straight Flush,  Either way the true short squeeze will occur.  Amen  \- The Oracle.
Paypal.. and its future?
Whats your thoughts guys? With their new business addition do you thinks its worth going in or is it at its peak?
Be careful for short ladder attacks before closing
T minus 18 minutes till lift-off, GME
About to leave the paperhands behind as we go towards glory once again
The plan is simple guys
HOLD $GME
I'll, preface this DD by stating that I would like to consider it open source. I am more than open to comments and criticisms and I would genuinely like to hear your thoughts on what is going on with $GME.  After watching $GmME and the broader market trade the last few weeks I've become convinced that we have the power to move the market, the "smart" know this and they are scared.    Firstly evidence for our power to move the market and what I have witnessed:        \- this chart compares $GME vs the $VIX over the last few weeks, they have been trading in near unison and increase in $GME cause a spike in the $VIX    . Exhibit A and B demonstrate the quick sell off in the S&P as GameStop "MOONS". I don't have any evidence however I would liken this to the raise in margin requirements from brokers and clearing agencies. This caused a quick sell off as positions were liquidated to meet margin.     \- Volume Profile:  A lot of the buying/selling column appears to be repeating which just seems odd, they don't on other days. Perhaps it was some shorts that had reloaded closing out a position or perhaps a larger buying getting in? I don't know too much about this so if someone could inform me that would be sweet!      \- This document describes the techniques that could be used to, " circumvent certain requirements of Regulation SHO". It is really complicated but to the best of my knowledge it describes complex options strategies that can be used to artificially appear to covering. The shorts could be using these strategies to "Reset the Clock" and be simply buying time.   Furthermore S&P Capital IQ is showing the there are still   million shares sold short as of Feb 03, this is down from Jan 26th however it is still ridiculously high and larger than the overall float, which I'm sure we must have close to 5-10% of that held by heroes like you.       Lastly I will add that I have seen an increased volume and open interest in $VIX calls dated for February 10th that have strike prices much higher than its current level. This coincides with the February 9th sort interest data that will be released the day prior and will likely have an impact on $GME stock. Given that we have seen increases in the price of $GME are mirrored by the $VIX, I believe some "smart money" has details on the SI data and as such is hedging or looking to profit from an increase in the $VIX.     Now what does all this mean. I believe that their is truly some shady shit going on behind the scenes. There is information we don't have access too, we may never but it seems like something is happening. Their is most certainly some kind of suppression at play and Wall Street didn't want us at this table. They may be slowly trying to unravel their short positions without causing any disruptions and that is why they wanted us out. It's also very possible that their are funds working both with and against us. Either way this is a pressure cooker that gonna that's gonna blow.       I will completely discredit everything I have said above by stating that  Lord Elon should buy in, use the Starlink infrastructure to create a game streaming service and once and for all f@#k shorts. Maybe he will drop a Atomic bomb on the shorts, who knows.         Disclosure: 37 $GME @ $136 average.         Please feel free to contribute and share ideas or just tell me how many chromosomes I have.
So your friends are acting like paper handed chimps? IDGAF.
So your friends are paper handed? Who gives a shit, are you? Yeah, you said you weren't, so don't be.   Your friend sold? All 20 shares of AMC? Neat. For every 20 of him there are 5 of me, holding 600+ like our hands were mined in a fucking diamond quarry.   Oh, someone like me sold? There's another 5 like me with 10x the amount of shares, holding.   Oh god, we're down 60%? Neat. Where were you when we were trading worthless options trying to write ourselves retirement tickets?  You didn't buy in to make 10%, and you didn't buy in to make 20%. You bought yourself a ticket to a roller coaster that comes around once every 10 years, so you better not hop off on the first loop because you're screaming and you're afraid of heights. The vocal minority of doomers and whiners who can't deal with their losses this week won't STFU? Cool, hold and make them regret those weak ass hands that would lose a fight against single ply toilet paper.   Turn off your phone, set price alerts and move on the best you can. This sub is beyond infiltrated and always will be. If foreign nations can interfere with elections, Melvin Capital can pay a firm to hire a team of basement dwellers to spam negeative sentiment while they pay CNBC and Motely Fool to run their bullshit "we won" FUD. This is Mr Gamestop and Mr AMC's wild ride, and im going to ride it into the ground or the sky until the wheels fall off and the cabin burns to pieces. Do your DD, read the charts or learn how to, get some sleep, eat some food, look at these from a logical perspective and take care of yourself and your shares.   Y'all know that scene in Planet of the Apes where Caesar says "NO"? That should be your diamond handed, crayon eating, born in the fire of options expiring worthless, watching people cry on livestream loss porn, stick it to hedgies, share holding ass right now when someone tries to tell you how to handle your shares.   This isn't financial advice, im not a financial advisor, I just like these stocks, I wear a helmet to bed and my wife has to spoon feed me my crayons after she melts them down. Maybe Papa Elon will have a spot on Mars where we can have our own club one day.   Obligatory Emojis:         EDIT: Someone asked for positions:   AMC.
Oh shit, it's a "short ladder attack" AND ITS TAKING OUR GAINS
Where should Robinhood refugees flee to? Fidelity vs. Vanguard vs. Schwab
ZOM
I think Zom is a good stock here is why.  So first off its trending up. Up 1000% since November and is up over 100% in the last month A month a go this stock was worth 4 cents and yesterday it closed at   and opened at  , at the time of this post its sitting at    Secondly  Zom is a company that is working develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for pets like dogs and cats. On top of that they are speeding up diagnostic processes for veterinarians. This could completely the game for veterinarians making their jobs easier and making things less stressful for pet owners. Lots of people have pets lots of people their pet. Pet care seems to be a huge market estimated at around 10 billion dollars  Thirdly  Zom has signed an agreement with Miller Veterinary Supply for the distribution of Truforma, Zomedica’s first product, planned to begin sales on March 30. That should send the price to the moon hitting in my opinion at least 5 dollars.  Lastly  There is also some hype behind it due to the Netflix series Tiger King not that this is a meme stock but I feel as if this will make more people aware of the stock and bring more traction to it   I'm just a retard this is not financial advice whatsoever this is literally my first DD just sharing my thoughts on a cool stock that I like and think will do well.  Tl;dr Zom a cheap stock that is increasing in price with a product being released in March    Edit    "It should be noted that due to covid, pet adoption is reaching highs . The product itself not only allows pet owners to conveniently assess their pet's health, but also allow them to do it within their homes safely. The product is releasing around spring time." ~ U/Xientist
I love you guys and I hope that the squeeze will come!
I jumped of, sorry... I literally couldn't sleep anymore and I almost didn't eat for the last 3 days. Even if I sold yesterday at 53 and now it's going up again I don't care because I feel way better now and I'm glad that I'm okay. I lost alot of money and I don't care either. I'm too scared to go back on the train but I know that the majority of you will stay and that's why I don't want to give up on you. I still want the squeeze to come and now that I'm feeling great again I'll try to help you guys out through this difficult time.   I am going to make 1 meme every day until the squeeze has been squozen and that is not negociable. I'm not a hater like all those paperhanded bitches that got out in time and are now spitting on the apes. I admit my loss but am still faithfull in this stock and I'll do everything to keep your heads cool and stress free until the squeeze and until these fkn billionaires go bankrupt and have to use regular toilet paper instead of dollar bills to wipe their ass off.  And remember  # YOU GUYS ARE APES  # YOU GUYS ARE TOGETHER  # YOU GUYS ARE STRONG  # HOLD THE LINE RETARDS   🤲            (To me, the friends we made along the way are way more important than any dollar in the world)  Hopefully this motivated you guys to keep holding :)
Thinking of selling $MAS
So when I was 11 back in 2011 my father wanted to teach me about the finance, and said he'd get a bunch of shares in a particular stock in my name, and that I could take it out when i was old enough.  Well I got $MAS (or masco) and i've held onto it for years. However i'm thinking of selling it to pay for something i desperately need. However, I won't have to take out all of the shares for the thing I need. So I was wondering, should I keep the rest in to bank off Masco, or put it in an account to let it accrue interest?  I know I don't visit this sub a lot (if at all) and i know now might not be the best time with the whole $gme thing going on. But i think it's important enough to ask online, and this is where one would ask.  (also, i dont think i have the skills needed to reinvest elsewhere, so this is kind of a one time thing)  Thank you for any help!
Still diamond handing, y’all just pussies who don’t believe in the company. $GME
AMC SPARTANS HOLD THE LINE
AMC after market bumpski anyone?
To the fellow new investors who bought into AMC because of the hype with zero experience like me, I need to say something to you.
just want to address something to my fellow new investors who joined the cause on the hype like I did.  nothing anyone says is certain. none of it is factual. anything and everything you hear about the market (other than stone cold data) is purely opinions and predictions. I keep seeing people say things like "I thought the squeeze was gonna happen already, thats what people were saying." thats on you. if that is the sole reason you are holding, you need a reality check. the people we are fighting have billions to lose. if they are not covering their shorts they are bleeding money through interest. this could take weeks, it could be tomorrow and a squeeze may never happen. either you're here willing to hold for the long run or you took a strangers word for more value than its worth and screwed yourself.  if you yolo'd money on a meme stock and you can't afford to lose anymore. cut your damn losses, you have to feed yourself first. but YOU made the decision to get into this. YOU transferred the money and bought stock. no one else. Im not going to lie, I bought into this with zero experience purely on the hype. my initial buy in was 12 dollar stocks. bad move. but you know what I've done since then? consumed as much information about the stock market as possible until I fall asleep. im out here literally reading SEC manuals. if you can't even read, the stock market probably ain't the place for you. im retarded yes, but so are you. the difference is im not dragging everyone down with me over my own personal mistakes. with that being said,   HOLD THE DAMN LINE. AMC TO THE MOON. IF WE STAY IN LONG FUCK IT. AMC IS UNDERVALUED.

What are your favourite Covered Calls play?
I'm on the hunt for a volatile stock with a good future and decent financials under $50. A dividend would be nice, but I assume it would be hard to find with my other criterias.  What are your favorite stocks to sell CCs with limited capital?  Is someone here selling calls while covering through leaps with a lower strike price?
It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers
Repost, because gaybears admins      Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen?  It’s simple. Let’s use the worst possible numbers here.  Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x   =   million shares. Let’s say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short.  Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let’s say they covered at 300. You’re telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x   =   billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we’re still talking about   BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would’ve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover.  Hold your fucking shares.  Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math.  Edit 2: I know I shouldn’t be surprised you retards don’t understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking   ZERO  . If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95=  -$45  Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I’m getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money.  Please get your head out of your ass.   if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER.    made by    , reposted cuz it needs to be seen!
HMNY Yolo big rocket
Make $GME great again... and hold
The only way to win this is to hold
Seriously, if we don’t hold or keep trading those stocks, they will just be covering their shorts little by little while they fuck the price of the stock and we won’t going to even see what the fuck went down.

Extremely undervalued tech/clean energy play with super cheap calls. $CLS
Need to get some money back from    GME? I know I do.  I know how much some of you guys love soon-to-be expired options, so ill list them first before any DD. 90% of you arent gunna read it anyways, although i know you would if you could.  I picked up 640 10c for 2/19. They were 5$ each. The stock is at   as im writing this and up .40$ from yesterdays low. These are cheap as shit. This is a very low volume stock and i havent seen it mentioned on r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, or r/options. So im mentioning it there in all 3.   This is not financial advice and you should do your own research before buying anything, let alone short dated options. You dont have to buy them for this play, im just explaining how undervalued they are.   10c for 2/19 (14 days) are $.05 10c for 3/19 (42 days) are $.20.   for 3/19 are $.10    Now onto the DD for Celestica:  Market   Free float:108m Avg Volume :310,000 Institutional ownership: 69%    Many of our good friends such as Citadel are even increasing their positions.  Other notable institutions: JP morgan, Vanguard, Goldman sachs, and Morgan stanley. Source:       They have over 24,000 employees, brought in   revenue in 2019, and have 35 manufacturing and design locations worldwide. Theyve been in business for 27 years.     Their most recent earnings, released jan 26, 2021, show an earnings of  $ per share, as opposed to a loss of  $ per share last year. This means that they were profitable during covid, and found ways to adapt and overcome the challenges the pandemic brought to many companies.    They have an “undrawn $450M revolver” as they put it on their site, or $464M in cash.    So what the fuck do they do? Yes.  Celestica Inc. Celestica inc. Is a provider of supply chain solutions. The company operates in electronics manufacturing services. The company offers a range of services to its customers, including design and development, engineering services, supply chain management, new product introduction, component sourcing, assembly and testing, complex mechanical assembly, systems integration, precision machining, order fulfillment, logistics and after-market repair and return services. Its products and services serve a range of applications, including servers, storage systems, optical equipment, aerospace and defense electronics, healthcare products and applications, semiconductor equipment, and a range of industrial and alternative energy products including solar panels and inverters. It designs, manufactures and tests solar panels for residential, commercial, and utility scale markets.  Im in this for the clean energy, innovative tech, supply chain, and aerospace. Theyre involved with lots of other things as well that make them a good play imo.  We all know biden has lots of plans for clean energy(looking at you ICLN gang), and that its a main focus of many governments around the world. They have 6 locations in China, 2 locations in South Korea, and 3 locations in Japan. These countries are leading the world in tech and clean energy. They also have 4 locations in California, and a few other locations throughout the US. Basically, theyre positioned perfectly for exposure to tech funding and innovation.  I can also see this being added to a few of the ARK ETFs, including the new space one, ARKX.  Their linkedIn page is full of jobs, they are looking to hire many different types of engineers and employees for product solutions. They pay their staff relatively well, (avg 60k per year with 32k/yr being minimum for warehouse staff.) The reviews from employees seem decent with an average of   stars on Glassdoor and   on indeed. Theres also real pics on there of people wearing lab coats in front of some fancy looking tech shit, which is very promising.  I dont know how to add pictures.     The only reason the chart dipped recently was due to the GME situation, there was no bad news and they are already back to approaching highs since pre-covid. Im assuming a certain few institutions had to sell to cover their margin call. Before the march crash, the stock peaked at   At the bottom of the crash, it was trading at   Since then, they have rebounded back to over 9$ per share and are approaching pre-covid highs. Their 2019 earnings were negative  $ per share, and their earnings for 2020 were $  per share. Again, this means that they went from losing money pre-covid, to being profitable during.  Reasons I believe the stock is undervalued: Very low volume in such a promising tech stock to me means that not many people know it exists, or that the company is dogshit. This company is not dogshit. A dogshit company is not spread globally with over 20k employees bringing in nearly 6B$/year in sales.  $CLS holds a P/E ratio of  , while its industry has an average P/E of     $CLS has a P/B ratio of   The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of    This alone makes them very undervalued.  $CLS has a P/S ratio of   This is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue, or sales. This is a useful metric on low volume/unheard of stocks, because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CLS has a P/S ratio of   This compares to its industry's average P/S of      CLS has a P/CF ratio of   This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of    Please let me know if you find more/better information, or if something ive said is incorrect.   Tldr: $CLS is a tech/clean energy company involved in many promising industries. They are undervalued in every sense of the word, and their options even more so. They have extemely low volume due to being unknown, but are by no means a dogshit penny stock. Stock is currently trading at  , and 10c for 2 weeks out are $.05. Yesterday they opened at  , found resitance at  , and climbed to   at close.   Positions (again): 640 x CLS 10c 2/19.       🪐                                                    $CLS           💥$GME 🌎

DD: H&R Block Leaps
Positions:  5 x Jan 20 2023 HRB $20C   5 x Jan 20 2023 HRB $25C  I have a feeling that I'm going to be ridiculed for this "deep value" play, but alas, here we go:  I'm buying HRB leaps for these reasons:  \-I'm betting on a major pivot that will severely impact their valuation. Last year, they took on 3 executives of Information Technology.   signals a paradigm shift within the company.  \-HRB tends to lag behind others in terms of SP recovery following a major market crash, but always come roaring back two-three years afterwards. (year 2000, 2012) There appears to be some correlation between economic recovery and people needing help with their taxes. I also view the rise in young people investing as a bullish sign for HRB.  \-Attractive fundamentals. I'm not wrinkly-brained enough to explain this in detail so do your own DD. I will mention that H&R Block's main competitor (TurboTax/Intuit) is valuated as an SaaS (P/S ratio of 13+) while H&R Block is valued as a brick and mortal boomer tax preparation company (P/S ratio of 1). If H&R Block can successfully make the strategic transition from a Brick and Mortar to an SaaS, or at least something in between, I believe HRB could be a multibagger.  Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. I'm a retard who flunked high school math. Do your own DD.

Question for All serious investors. It's about GME
If I was A Billionaire Hedge Fund Associate. If you where a Billionaire Hedge Fund Associate.  Would you ... or I ever  ... EVER ... EVER ... admit Defeat to a bunch of Autistic Apeing Retards that Yolo Money on Whatever they Want.  Think about it.
This came up in my WSB feed. A message to all you
I hold everything always like true retarded   🤚
Will the hedge funds close all at once? If not how do we profit?
Alright so I read   by u/HilmGlazed and they attributed this mornings spike to someone closing 2 millions shorts. They said that their are 60 million left. Now In the comments many were saying that the hedge funds would close little by little and wait for the price to go down before they do it again. Is this true? If it is how would we make any money if the stock never gets higher than 90? I am legitimately asking for any help.
BIG News Regarding ROBINHOOD LAWSUIT! HOLD! (not advice)
Everyone here should read this (2 minute) article regarding this lawsuit, 6 hedge funds and 9 brokers were added to the suit for; "allegedly conspired together to knowingly deprive retail investors of the ability to invest in the open market during an unprecedented stock rise, in order to benefit the hedge fund companies, such as Citadel, Melvin Capital, and Maple Lane Capital." THEY ROBBED US. WE WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG. THERE IS STILL INTEREST TO BE COVERED. THEY ARE SCARED TO DEATH. THEY ARE RIGGING THIS MARKET.     but we'll see im just a degen, god bless.        EDIT: I understand joining the class action lawsuit is pointless, but if this goes through fully, that means we were CORRECT with our plays. With that being said, definitely expecting another big jump next week sometimes. Short Interest Reports on the 9th :)
Wonder where we've seen this before
What will happen to TWST next??
Wondering what you guys think abt the huge drop on the symbol TWST because of its valuation. Is it a buy? Will it drop down to 100? Who knows!!  I wanted to buy it back when it was at about $50 but i regret it obviously so I have been watching the symbol!
Can someone explain how the hell AMC is dropping still??
Officially over $1,500 in the red! Still holding     🤚 🤚! Does this mean I’m part of the club now??
Of all the wholesome comments here, they choose to quote this...
Mad at Robin Hood? The "Clearing house" approved everything that allowed all funds to pay a portion of the orders that were outstanding.
Stop apologizing for the Clearing House decisions by attacking the platform you got pumped and DUMPED.  AGAIN lol
I learned my lesson trying to beat reddit in a video game. Wall St. should have tried fake money first, smh.
So let’s be honest, what actually happens if on Tuesday, the report is as we’ve been estimating, a large short(125%+)position, or much less?
This could be me.
Never forget WSB origins "buy the dip, sell the bottom"
If u ever think of selling. Think again.  It didn't hit bottom yet. So that means it's not time to sell. Wait for the bottom.

DD: I know how to end these short ladder attacks once and for all and send GME to the moon!  🤲
OK so we all know at this point Melvin has seriously suppressed the GME price through fraud and manipulation. Their main weapon is short ladders, and so far we have not found a good counter measure, until now!  I know this plan may sound a little crazy, and it's gunna take A LOT of cooperation.  But together, us APES R STRONG!!!!!  How do we stop short ladders you ask?  Well, the first step is to know your enemy.  Melvin Capital is a firm in New York City.  Their headquarters in on Madison Avenue in a building on the   22nd Floor  .  The only way we're ever getting all the way up there is with incredibly  #LONG LADDERS  That's right.  How poetic that we can beat them at their own game by weaponizing ladders.  Once we're up there we pour mountain dew all over their keyboards and then the attacks should end.
Gary here is the first one to add (6) hedge funds and (9) Brokers to the SAME lawsuit. 6 9 NICE
Popular Interest in GME is Increasing and Remains Strong
Just did a little bit of research and thought the community may benefit from the modest ramblings of a degenerate gambler like myself.   TLDR: The core idea is that GME's stock price benefits tremendously from momentum and popular interest. There is very obvious evidence that the two were correlated over the last couple of weeks, but I posit that they are causally related. I think I have evidence of two things:  1. Momentum is rising 2. Popular interest is rising  Finally, I argue that momentum and interest are causally related and that the recent correlation has some underlying explanation that utilizes both points above. This is not advice, I just like GME. I have shares and options (02/12 $305c!). Also, I have no idea what I'm talking about, feel free to correct me.      The data:  1. Google trends  A.    2. volume:  A.    B.       Search interest, stock price and volume are all correlated over the last few months, and especially so in the last week. It would be nice if we had finer resolution search data because we could see if the buying over the day is granularly correlated with google search volume (indicates that the two are causally related).  The first figure in 1A shows search interest over the last month in the US with daily ticks. I see a big spike when we were in the 300s last week, then a sharp decline, and the appearance of a recovery. Daily interest appears sustained, elevated, and growing. The second figure in 1A shows hourly ticks over the last 7 days, blue is the search term 'gamestop' and red is 'gme'. I see that interest in the stock was steady between the end of last week and the start of this week, if anything it peaked a bit higher on Monday. I also see that public interest is fading (the blue line probably approximates public interest, non investors who don't know the symbols). However, the red line is still spiking robustly, which I interpret to mean that people who are actually investing in the stock are still checking it out. Of course there is probably a mixture of GME shareholders and non-shareholders who still use the term, and you can see the baseline move a lot over time. My guess is the red signal can be decomposed into at least two components: the baseline (mostly non-shareholders) and the daily spikes (shareholders). I have the most confidence that the yellow line (term='gme stock') is mostly shareholders and it appears much more constant (shows a much smaller difference between last week's peak and this week's peak). All of this leads me to conclude that interest in owning the stock is starting to become uncorrelated from the media's reporting and is actually still likely increasing.   2A shows the monthly price, volume, and change with daily ticks. 2B shows the last 5 days with minute ticks. I believe that both charts show that the volume is increasing again.  I think this is because restrictions were lifted and perhaps because uncertainty at the beginning/middle of the week is starting to dissipate. It appears that investors were still trying to play the early morning swings this week and interest in trading the stock picked up during the week. All of this supports my conclusion that buying interest among retail is recovering and setting up to spike again at the beginning of next week.     Momentum is in part generated by trading volume and sustained price movement. You can clearly see in 2A that there are two phases: a green phase in the beginning and a red phase after the spike. Green days are more likely to be followed by green days and red days are more likely to be followed by more red days at least in the short term. However, dynamics can shift and the trend can flip. Today appeared to show evidence of that flipping and I believe it indicates we are more likely to have a big green monday. The morning price spikes have been getting larger over the last couple days since the restrictions are up. I think these spikes will keep getting bigger and bigger through next week. As momentum increases and those spikes get more reliable, people will be less afraid to hold through the day and the feedback continues until short meltdown. Looking forward to Monday, but diamond hands forever.
CHARLES SCHWAB IS THE WAY
Hey guys I just want to report to you the 2 incidents I had over the course of the GME week where everybody's Robin hood got totally butt fucks The 1st is on Monday I could not sell my Microsoft and fortunately it rebounded and I did not take a loss but for the badge experience Charles Schwab gave me $200. The next day my MRNA that I attempted to sell would not go through and I did incur as $550 loss and had a trade dispute filed That dispute was supposed to take 30 days but it only took like 4 or 5 and they gave me the sale price of when I attempted to sell and reimburse me my $550 or whatever. Seriously Charles Schwab is the way I don't know about Fidelity I have no experience but personally speaking from my experience Charles Schwab is good
Move to Fidelity or someone else FFS
How can you be beaten just from being blocked from certain trading platforms like Robin Hood?  And some posts saying trading is now at the moment allowed back on Robin Hood. Why would you decide to buy any more stock there when they betrayed you like so and even sold stock without your approval?  This is not financial advice.  Why are admins not creating a good post explaining what platforms to move to that have not betrayed the customers yet and pin it?
What if Gamestop became the Spotify/Netflix of games
A monthly fee and lots of available games. Becoming a worthy stock on its' own. This is not a financial advice.
Let’s take one of our biggest advantages one. step. further. Don’t like if you don’t read. I know, I do that too
$GME only  We all know that one of the superpowers of this r/  is our willingless to share all the information that we have in hand with other regular peeps. Empowering people with information is something that big hedge funds dont do. They thrive in secrecy.  This is a simple petition,  like this post if you have more than 2 shares of $GME. and are willing to hold for long term. Comment your pos  <numberofshares>@<average> hold until $<selllimit>  If 1000 simps in here comment, I will create a bot to scrape this post and a website to publish. We can get an idea of how many people we have holding. Fuck you if you dont want to.  21@120 hold until $3200
So How's This Movie Gonna End..?
This whole thing is similar to the way Facebook eventually designed their product: Get the user engaged and addicted to confirmation bias and the tribal need to belong to a group. Also FOMO, YOLO, and whatever the fuck other shit. This became addicting for a lot of us, very fast. Addicted to watching the changing stock prices on our phones, and addicted to the reassurance on social media that our gamble is paying off and knowing WE WERE RIGHT. We have been addicted to the potential gains, and all that stuff. It was fun at first, but we got hooked and now we are chasing the high, right? I don't blame anyone, and I still have this fucking feeling in the back of my mind that we will ride to the moon n shit. But, the date of the squeeze kept getting pushed back, dangling the carrot. Did we fall for some shit? Was it the HF? Was it RH, and other trading platforms? Was it the system? Was it users on reddit using us to keep the stock price at a point where they could juggle around and make quick money every day after they already sold around the peak? Was it all legitimate and we are still holding against a desperate HF until they finally tap out and our patience pays off? Was it greed? Do I stink? Did you fart?  Who farted.......

AMC LET’S BEAT $  BEFORE CLOSE!!!! (Options Expiring Today) WE CAN DO THIS!!!
Why is there an inverse correlation between GME & AMC vs. the rest of the stock market?
Just seems weird that for the entire week from 12/29 through today, that whenever GME goes up, the rest of the market, eventually goes down, then when GME goes down the rest of the market goes up.    I'm a noob, couldn't afford holding my 3@300 & 4@220 anymore, but how many times has that been consistent over the course of a full week of the market?
Not every negative comment about GME/AMC are from hedgies, some (probably most) are from shorties.
I remember back when ROKU was in the 150 range. I used to hang out in the comment section on Yahoo Finance and see everyone so excited posting bullish stuff.     AND THEN THE BEARISH GEY SHORTIES ATTACKED     They preached doom and gloom, saying ROKU was destined to be a doomed stock and that everyone was wasting their money. And a little over a year later we all know how that turned out. Maybe some of them were hedgies, but the vast majority of them were investors just like you and me just waiting for you to take their words to heart, freak out once the value dropped by a decent bit, and sell so they can reap the benefits for their short positions.   #And they're doing that shit again.  Disregard negativity, aquire more stonks, fuck bitches.  (this is not financial advice like seriously I drink nail polish)
If people who sold at the top would buy in again the price would rocket
GME can't be shortet anymore and because of that the price isn't going down anymore, it's just going sideways right now. So what we saw was, that the price went up when the restrictions from robinhood got removed, because people could buy in again. So the more we buy and hold, the more we decide the price!!!  So buy and the price will go up, the more we make the price go up, the more the short sellers and hedge funds will have to pay up and the bigger the squeeze will be!!!!  FYI: this is not investment advice, i just like the stock  TLDR: BUY AND HOLD!!! The Diamonds hands will be rewarded  Btw I'm retarded and blind
Everybody fucking read this  . And give u/sfjetsetter his tendies

A Serious Examination on Future Outcomes of GME
If the hedge funds are doing ladder attacks and counterfeiting shares, what is stopping them from covering their own shorts once they've dropped the share price down to a price where they can exit their position and come out unscathed?  What is stopping them from tanking the stock to zero?  What is stopping them from liquidating all assets back to their original investors and declaring bankruptcy, completely avoiding having to cover their shorts?  What is going to be the future outcome? and what strategy are we going to employ to put ourselves in a better position?  The optimistic rally is beneficial, but I think it would additionally benefit WSB if we all engaged in intellectual discussion about our current position.
What do these candle wicks mean in the past few minutes?
The next short squeeze...
Probably won't be GME again. But when they announce the monthly short interest, if any of you has a brain, you'll check for stocks that DO have high short interest, as well as (preferably low float) and relatively low volume (low liquidity means you can scoop up the float more easily) and then check to see the interest rate to borrow (high interest means brokers deem it a relatively risky short - either because there are few shares to short or the short price is close to what it's currently at).   I sincerely doubt there are any stocks that have been left at risk of squeezing after the last two weeks, but you never know.

Did Robinhood enable the margin feature by default on new accounts?
Because if they did, that’s how they screwed us. Margin-enabled accounts automatically allow shares to be borrowed by the shorts. Every share you were bying was working against you because it was shorted by the hedge funds.   When Robinhood restricted you from bying shares, they lent your shares to the hedge funds to sell them on the market. That’s how the short squeeze was interrupted. They ducked you in more than one way.
Everyone should make this their wallpaper when they're on their way to Tendietown.
I beat the game guys!!! Apparently you’re not supposed to diamond hand options
Lets assume there is a second squeeze
Okay assuming there are still enough shorts around that we can squeeze them again and bigger than   on earth are you still using Robin Hood? What do you think will happen when there is another squeeze that goes up to 300 dollars or beyond ? You just trust that there will be no restriction this time? If you hope for a second squeeze transfer to a proper broker until February 9th when we get the new numbers this light be a breaking point in what will happen. And if it happens later rh will probably make sure  you will be a bag holder and won’t allow what they feel like or the hedgies tell them
BB last call before next week, will it go to 18 by next Friday?
With the rumor of several catalyst’s next week. What do you think it could go to? 18 or higher?
Class Action Lawsuits vs. RH/HF
DD for PELOTON
Back to the good old days when people posted DD for stocks instead of just screaming BUY this.    Here's my argument for Peloton:    They just had their earnings yesterday and it dipped almost 10% in the AM and is on a   sharp recovery   mode. They far exceeded top line and beat all metrics -   the reason for the dip?     Due to such high demand,   Peloton warned that it will face supply constraint. I like this kind of problems because the   reward for overcoming such issue is great given the amount of risk.   APPL had similar issue for iPhone 12 and it figured it out. AMD and NVDA is currently facing these issues.   Why I like Peloton's business model is:   There's a high investment to buy a unit. Once you reel in the customers, they need to pay monthly subscription. This is a great cash flow model similar to NFLX, COSTCO, etc. However it's even better because people will continue to pay for subscription after sinking in $3k for a peloton bike.   I mean it's like a cult man...   I'm still holding GME but that is a long term play for me and I need some excitement in the near term.   Position: May calls $170 strike.  Mark my words this goes to $160 within 2 weeks. If not I will buy 1,000 GME shares for the team.
I’m not good at this, but like a Phoenix GME will rise me from the ashes  🤲
I just want to say that I'm proud to be a complete cuck moron
This sub is the antithesis of Wall Street.   We brag about our wives being fucked, instead of fucking hot women  We're proud to be retarded  We're proud of our losses  We laugh in the face of -%  I only thought about it just now.. all of the stereotypes of the typical wall street investor are completely flipped on their head here and it's beautiful.

TAAT a look in the Future
Disclaimer: This is no financial advice and im nothing more than an ape with crayons🦧. This might not be the quality DD you’re used to. English is not my first language and im fairly new to WSB (lurking for about 4Months). I personally own shares of this stock! Ok with that out the way lets get down to business.   TAAT lifestyle and wellness is a company which produces Cigarettes made out of CBD. I see great long term potential for this company.   They are still fairly small but provide a good alternative for cigarettes. The reviews of the TAAT Cigarettes were very positive but unfortunately since i don’t live in America i couldn’t try them myself yet. They currently work on bumping up the production and currently produce 5800 Rods of Cigarette packs per day, which comes out to around 144000 per month, which is an estimated 5,76 Mio. USD per month. Obviously this isn’t even comparable to big Tobacco companies but the are currently searching for even more production facilities to bump up the production even further. So there is still a lot of Potential for Growth. The stock also had a fairly good run growing 387% in one year with a lot of buzz around the stock the past week causing a 89% increase in one day. The hype died down a little bit and is thus Investment worthy again without having an for this stage overvalued stock price.  Their current expansion strategy involves sending out TAAT cigarettes via their only store to spread market recognition. This initiative is called TryTAAT and from what i gathered is pretty successful. Im in on the long run and see a lot of Potential growth for this company.

Naked Shorting - Who Didn’t Play By the Rules?
DD on Naked Short Selling, Failure to Deliver, and Short Interest - Who didn’t play by the rules?  First, some terms (skip if you know them):  #What is naked shorting?  The  illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. This practice is illegal because it places artificial downward price pressure on a stock and also because it has absolutely no basis in reality. You can’t sell something that doesn’t exist.      #What is Failure to Deliver?  Occurs when one party in a trading contract does not deliver on their obligation. (  I borrow shares to short sell that don’t actually exist, so I am unable to actually deliver the shares I am selling to a buyer)     #What is Short Interest?   The number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out (  returned to the borrower)      #How are these terms related?  While short interest and FTD are to some extent natural market phenomena,  there is a demonstrable correlation between high short interest, high FTD rates, and the existence of naked short selling for a stock.     Perhaps more importantly, the above article establishes that FTDs are not “random” occurrences, and are instead intentional and illegal actions taken by short sellers in some cases.  #Was there naked short selling with GME?  Almost certainly, yes. GME has been on the NYSE securities threshold list every trading day since December 8, meaning there were substantial failures to deliver for 39 consecutive trading days. The SEC is supposed to take action after 13 days per their own regulations.       Moreover, GME short sale volume has been extraordinarily high since December 8 (average short sales &gt;50% of total sell volume)     #What does this all mean?  It means that someone(s) cheated by engaging in fraud on a massive scale and then doubled down on the fraud in order to protect overexposed short positions. And the SEC didn’t do shit about it.   #Ok so they cheated, no surprise there, what can I do about it?  1) Submit a TCR complaint to the SEC    2) Contact your local, state, and federal representatives and tell them that you are very upset.

Is holding AMC the move?
I'm going for long term holds I do legit think it could crack 20 but what about those short term gains?
Newbie looking for an answer on options.
I’m new to stocks and only been in it a month. I’m trying to learn options to expand my knowledge. I was curious about one thing. Say I buy a call @$45 for 2/19 with a premium of   I know that I pay the $395 for one option at 100 shares. Say the stock Goes to $60 by 2/19. Do I then get those 100 shares since I was above my strike price or do I then have to pay more to get those shares ($45 x 100 shares = $4500 to then own the 100 shares). Any info is appreciated. Thanks in advance.  Edit: I appreciate everyone’s help and info! You guys cleared it up for me. I just want to learn as much as I can before making any moves.

Buying pressure
Last time I made this post I had some pussies telling me how bad of a person I was because I was trying to tell people what to do or some shit like that idk I don’t  really pay to much attention to the weak, butt just to be clear. I’m not at all telling people to do this. I am not a financial advisor and this should NOT be taken as financial advise. I just put pieces together and try to make sense of it.  I very well may be retarded and or Ill informed on the current buying pressure gme has. However I am STRONGLY not against doing anything that would benefit you, IN REGARDS to inviting people to be a part of “this”. (If you catch my drift) I know some people in this world just aren’t cut out to do what they need to do and that’s fine, play it safe. Do you, I don’t judge. Trust me..   Right now though, if any of you are still betting on gme to raise in prices  just realize that buying pressure is what you need now. Generally speaking... most people... or a large group of people found out about GME through social media, wether it was from post, memes, or social media influencers from all the big apps. (Twitter, Instagram, tiktok etc) . If you expect the stocks your INVESTING on to increase you have get gme trending on social media again. Again, I’m not telling you to invest anything in the stock market. If you support the movement your doing enough by posting on social media, but if you want to bring awareness to the movement going viral with GME is the wave we need to ride. I THINK. And very rarely does a ape think.   And also If you think that gme likeliness to go viral again are low,  just be aware that “the bank challenge” has been going viral for weeks now, and we alll know about the effort they’ve made to keep movements like that going. So anything is possible. Point being Get creative and tell everyone and you just might pull this off. POSSIBLY.    IT COST NO MONEY TO POST ON SOCIAL  IT COST $0 to post anything about gme on social media.  I AM NOT TELLING ANYONE TO BUY MORE STOCKS.  THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.  THIS IS ONE RETARD SPEAKING APE.

Serious discussion
I’m not intelligent, I’m not expired in the markets. So I have to ask, from my understanding is it possible that the hedge fund covered their positions when the prices were up at $400 ? If not they would be still here bleeding paying interest correct ? So wouldn’t people knowing this jump on it and capitalize on the fact they might still have not covered all their positions. I think they exited most of their positions but it’s impossible that they all of them and the short is still high. I keep hearing a bunch of dates being thrown around and if things were looking good you the stock would get some traction going but it’s no? There’s a high chance all the psychological affects of seeing your money disappear and all these loses occur make you want to stay out and not get in it but who am I to say. Can someone just please talk numbers ?
Why you should drop RobinHood - not the squeeze.
Look, the betrayal alone should be enough that we delete that app forever but are we forgetting the fact that they sell our order flows to the guys on the other side of our trades??   This is game changing, and means big plays are essentially impossible on RH. You will always lose. The big players will come for your stop losses. How do you think it’s free? You paid for it now.   Also let’s not forget they don’t have the capital for any future short squeeze or high volume plays. So if/when the next big thing comes, make sure you’re not ok RH.

$GME     HOWEVER
I am not stock genius. A self proclaimed retautist. NYSE? NYSE Who? I dont know, I never learned to read.  But hear me out. When you publish false material to the public on the status of your holdings, by, for example, saying "we have covered all of our short positions in $GME" when that position is a considerably large SI% or share of the individual stock, when in fact, you have done the opposite (still holding the same position) wouldnt that be clear cut manipulation?   If you answered yes to that question, then perhaps melvin did indeed cover their position. Perhaps we are in fact holding the bag.   I like the stock.   But I see nefarious intentions behind a lot of what we read. Manipulation, and i cannot stress this enough, but TRUE manipulation doesnt and cant come from one source (there are exceptions). On this level you must infiltrate the source of the opposing side as well as controlling your own. We (WSB, reddit) are an open forum. Anyone can post. You think people have been attempting to convince the majority of WSB to buy x, or y only recently? You're wrong. It's not only the accounts that have 1, 2 or 3 days of existence. They have been here for years, they have karma, they are one of us to the highest degree.  Further more, deepfakes? Lmfao. How bout some good ol' fashioned photoshop, or simple data/source code manipulation? That's all that's needed to convince 3 million of us that licking_ur_moms_taint69 just bought 1m worth of AMC/GME Etc. You dont need all  , you just need a good portion after all.  I'm not trying to cause panic. I'm not saying buy or sell. I am saying fucking hold if you have it. Buy if you're a true autist, and sell if you're retarded. This isnt financial advice. But please; For the love of all that's worth our time: use your own head with the first question I asked. They cant so blantenly manipulate like that. our glorified WSB has, through individuals, claimed melvin lied. But that may of been the whole intent. Say the truth, get us to believe the lie. That's the game.
Some nice gains today

SEC COMPLAINT FILED FOR GME TRADING ABUSE
I filed a complaint with the SEC for GME trading abuse and manipulation by hedge funds and broker imposed restrictions. Would encourage others who feel the same way to take action and file a complaint as well. Trying to hold the faith

I styled a Dark Mode for Yahoo Finance (Web) if anyone wants it (works for charts too)
Here's the custom CSS:    If you're like me, you probably hate when websites and apps don't have a dark mode available, especially for stocks, because I'm often doing research late and the eye strain is rough.  Anyway, Yahoo Finance (Web) doesn't have any sort of dark mode, and I really like the app (which does have dark mode) and watchlist/ability to link a brokerage, so I didn't want to stop using it. So I spent the day editing the CSS to make it work for me.  Using it is simple. I use  . I left some comments in the code to explain what some sections are changing, in case you want to adjust the colors yourself or add other elements.  For anyone unfamiliar with CSS, this ain't any sneaky deaky hacky shit, you're not gonna get a virus. It's just styling for the webpage.  Anyway, it was useful for me so I thought I'd share it to save some eyeballs. Let me know if you find it useful.

Hold BB or try and break even?
Trying to gauge the general idea about BB are we holding on till the moon or should we try to break even?
Guys, I lost over $1500 on AMC now, so I panicked and bought 22 more shares.
Don’t be Joey Bush with your $GME
I just felt it was gonna go up today

This is the way
Who is left selling AMC at   I mean the only people left should be “  ”   stock been $6 since the beginning...
Today, I join you, my fellow retard apes
I just bought my first ever stock and I’m proud to say it was $GME.   I’ve been following this whole thing over the last week and you retards have been so entertaining that I’ve been glued to this subreddit 24/7.   I know nothing about money, investing, stocks... but I opened a wealth simple account, deposited 1000$. It is now the third day and the funds have transferred and I bought $GME for the cause.  Idgaf what the outcome is, but just know that a new autist retard ape has joined you guys and will be holding till we get launched to the moon or to the center of the earth.   From Canada, hold strong my brothers. 🌕 🌕 🌕
I’ve only ever seen red, but still holding.  🏻
Hold the line
Listen... I’m nobody. I’m not in finance. I’m not a founder of this beautiful dance with hedge fund fuck-faces. But we’re all here now, and we have to hold the line. An example needs to be made if these fucks. SO... here’s my proposal. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. HOLD IT. If you’re getting scared, anxious, unsure of your financial future... remember that you’re probably helping to shape the future of finance in the US. You’re on the front lines of a war we didn’t know existed until a couple months ago. But, since this is a collective effort. So your fears need to be addressed. This is my suggestion. Again,  not  financial advice.  First of all... if you sell shares and the price dips down, who do you think is going to buy those shares at an inflated price and then short them if this bubble bursts?? HEDGE FUNDS.  Next... if everyone panics and sells their shares before they lose their shirts, who is gonna capitalize on the failed effort? HEDGE FUNDS. SO... sell a little. Like 5%. Just enough to take some pressure off but not enough to topple our cause. Put some money in your pocket. Take your mom to Sizzler. Sleep well tonight. But don’t freak out. Don’t panic sell. Remember that your kid’s kids are watching how this turns out.  Thoughts?
DFV isn't an average Joe, so he can't like the stock. :-(

A wake-up call for the GameStop leeches.
I was one of you. I made $5,000 on the squeeze and I believed in GameStop so much that I put it back in. From there, I lost $7,000 and finally accepted defeat. It’s time you get a little wake-up call.  Welcome to the jungle. Nobody cares that you put a second mortgage on your house to buy GME at $350. Don’t play with money you can’t afford to lose. Ever. Most of you apes are new here, so I’ll lay something out for you that nobody else will: you’re on a team of one. Everybody can post memes and pretend to be on a team, but in the end it’s every man for himself. You will be held responsible for the money that you lose, and no amount of rocket emojis can help you out.  Secondly, here’s a harsh truth: GameStop is not going to the moon. The squeeze is over. If you took a loss like I did, that sucks. Oh well, you’ll get your chance again in 10 years. I would sell while it’s still a greatly overvalued stock, but that’s just me. Regardless of what you’re doing, stop posting pure shit. This isn’t r/GME, and we can discuss other stocks here.  If you’re still holding GME right now, I’m sorry to say but you’re on the short bus with all the other bagholders now. This was never about “sticking it to the hedge funds”, it was about making profit. Those who are smarter have taken advantage of your hive mind, and you STILL haven’t caught on. Seriously, most of us realized we got played earlier in the week. When will you?  There’s about an hour left before market close. When it opens on Monday morning, you don’t want to be the idiot holding the shit bag.
Did i miss a red day?
We are up 15% after a few days of massacre and instead of cheering, the sub is filled with negativity again. Are we supposed to jump 10000% in a single day. You should've learned by now they will never let that happen.  And please, you don't have to make it sound like you are leaving a cult if you sell. Some people will sell and that's the nature of it. We will mess with you and call you   ️ bitch and that's the end of it. We don't have a blood pact that will put a curse on you if you sell.    ️ I'm not fucking selling. I like the stock and i don't like whoever is so "worried" about my own goddamn money.
I made it to the top on GME and all the way back down again, AMA

This is why AMC is trading under 7 bucks right now
Maybe I'm boring, but this is the most fun I've ever had gambling.
I mean yes, the math checks out, I have plenty of reasons to believe significant profit is possible, even likely, for us.  But hey. This is wallstreetBETS- so I'm betting as big as I can and still pay rent next month. For me, it's been a wild roller coaster of emotions, that I haven't really felt since coronavirus shut things down. I haven't really felt much in a while, and while some feelings are bad and some feelings are good, it's nice just feeling something strongly.  I think what I miss most of all is being a part of something with other people, that's what I'm doing now. It's super cool what we're doing. What are your reasons that YOU'RE having a good time?  14 GME @    Oh yeah, APES TOGETHER STRONG        and so on.
I just think they’re neat.
Last chance for the dead cat bounce
If I was underwater I would not pass up the opportunity to take this bump, get out and live to fight another day.

Things I learned from my wife's boyfriend (and you should too)
Obligatory long time lurker first time retard.  Before gme and amc I was a paper hander. This was because I was using scared money, and my wife didn't have a boyfriend yet so she was constantly telling me to take the kids and get out. Now that she does though I'm turning into Neil   🤲.  Since it takes a special person to bang another man's wife I decided to see if I could learn something from my wife's boyfriend through observation.  Here are my totally empirical research results: 1. You need massive balls 2. You can't just squeeze whenever you like, sometimes you just gotta hold (her stocks). 3. If she's feeling down, buy some more shiny things (stocks). 4. Just like marriage, he too is in it for the long run. 5. Sucking dick behind a Wendy's is always a good way to earn cash if you're desperate.  So take from this what you will, but know that i regularly eat crayon's.  Edit: a word...
Explaining the bet of a guy who has a good 401k is making a living not on the stock market
So if whatever happens with GME, if the ride is over then cool I am holding stock I  like until I retire  lowering dollar cost average along the way, I don't need it, spent unused vacation money on it. If I am left holding the bag it's cool I like what's in it.    If it rockets to mars, probably going to hurt my 401k cause wall street magic so I better have some GME.     Hoping to catch a rocket, take a profit reinvest in GME cause I am betting the Chewy guys make money again

All the “Who still holding”posts are just hedgie interns seeing if they should start covering
They are counting guys. Its a conspiracy. And mr hedgie intern we admit defeat we already all sold. You can cover the short now. 😉
Why do GME AND AMC have the exact same trend?
Their rides and drops is what I’m talking about.   I’m thinking this is cause of some manipulation on hedge funds part or something else not reddit related,  but I also know little about the stock market and maybe it’s cause of the time of the day but any other stock I see does not have the same trend as GME and AMC. Can anyone explain why
Why I bought in on AMC and why I'm going to HOLD
Here's why after watching all this going on the past week I decided two only do two things.  1. bought 1 put option on GME (all I could afford) when it was at $320. I was late to the party to ride it up, so I rode it down. Sue me. 2. Bought 300 shares AMC at $  and I'm going to hold. After watching it play up and down and not hitting that mark I misjudged and thought that would be the floor. We can see it went a bit lower. That's OK, I grabbed this intending to hold it, not expecting any instant return. I can live with a little red for now.  Why buy and hold AMC? I personally go to the movies 2-3 times a week. I go to AMC only. I started going the day they reopened theaters ( I saw Back to the Future that day). It has been dead, Dead, DEAD from then until Christmas. I usually was the only person in the theater with a private showing. Even on Fridays. That's not the case anymore. In my area restrictions are the same as they were before but now I never have a theater to myself. Even old reruns have 3-4 people. I'm seeing couples and people bringing their kids again. Even on midweek days. Sure, they only have one or two showings per film per day, but that's all going to change as the demand grows. and is already has been.  People want to go out again, and are already, and we are still in the deepest part of the pandemic. As we get the population vaccinated there will be less and less holding anyone back. Two years of big titles are ready to release and coming. AMC is going to dominate the marketplace. I wouldn't be surprised to see a merger or them possibly making a deal to acquire Cinemark (which actually I don't want to see, because I'm sure that would make holding AMC an even longer play). They already just shed 600M in debt. That's a huge boon to their bottom line. Come summer they will be profitable. In Fall they will kill it.  Just a recap for those who don't remember. The stock was trading at $3 when movies were literally playing to empty auditoriums, and they were about to declare bankruptcy. Now they made over HALF A BILLION of debt vanish, bankruptcy is completely off the table, movie goers are significantly up and rising, and we are rounding the corner on the pandemic. All that changed for them, and you're telling me that makes them only worth $  more? "Well, they are still losing money right now!" OK, you're right. You think they won't ever make money again? Not even with emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position than they were before? As soon as they report a profit on quarterly earnings, that's when you'll see the price rocket. "But, the business model is failing, it's all about streaming now!" Yea, and when Jeff Bezos started selling printed books online they said he was nuts because it was all supposed to be about e-books on tablets. Now he's the richest man on the planet. Turns out people liked buying old fashioned books so much that he was able to use his platform to start selling them everything. He never would have gotten there if nobody wanted books like they said. The more complex the world gets, the more people like the simple pleasures they are used to. Movies aren't dead.  Nine months from now people without the balls to buy at the low and hold will look back and kick themselves when the price closes up 400% from now. Then I'll sell them my shares for over $20 and take my earnings and they can cry when AMC sits at $20-$25 for a year and then some because a fool today is going to be a fool then too.

Been saving this for our 🤡  friends - may you console each other during this trying time
Time to get our minds right about $GME and the Feb 9th Short Report
First off I'm retarded and don't know anything about anything, don't listen to me, not financial advice. Just some thoughts.      I'm super excited and sych'd for the coming days and week, looking for a MOON landing, and I'm also a realist. I'm trying to think like a HF in this situation. What would I do if I were in their position?  Feb 9th the new short data is released, so the HF's will need to make some type of play. These are the 3 options I suspect they have.   Their options are:  1. Be honest, not manipulate the numbers, and publish the actual short data they have. This would be the dumbest move they could possibly do. There are so many retarded apes to get validation that the stock is still shorted >100%. If they do this there will be a buying frensy by not only WSB retards, but everyone that was sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what would happen. This alone could send the price soaring. If I were the HF there's no way in hell I'm doing this. 2. Fill their shorts and buy buy buy. This would certainly send the price to the moon, and the HF will take a ridiculous loss, but it would be a better option than #1 because there would be fewer apes holding shares. If I'm the HF, seeing how we were able to manipulate the market this week, I'm not very inclined to take this loss.  3. The HF can do what they know how to do best, and continue to manipulate the market. They can manipulate their shorted stock so that the % is reduced on the report. They've been in the game a long time and know some nasty tricks that they can try. They also have a lot of friends with a lot of money, so as long as the stock price doesn't get too crazy, they could figure out a way to continue paying interest while they wait for us to lose interest and panic sell, thus reducing the possible squeeze. Given the reaction on WSB, the Media, and the amount of interest that was apparently lost in just 5 days from many of the paper hands, this is the rout I would go if I were the HF. If I can hold out long enough for you to get discouraged and lose interest, then I won't lose my ass as bad.      Do not be surprised or discouraged, if they chose to do option #3. I suspect they will, and if they do, they will make it look like the world has ended for $GME, and it will be an illusion. They probably have the means to pay short interest for a while, maybe even weeks or months, but they won't be able to pay short interest forever. Then they will have no choice but to close their short position.      I'm going to HOLD. By holding we can keep the number of available shares lower, thus making the price rise fast when they start to fill. Look at the Jump that happened this morning. About 13MM shares changed hands in about an hour. Looking into it further the bulk of those trades were less than 10 shares big. That tells me that there's still a TON of interest from the little guys and girls, and if the HF is going to have to fill 60MM+ shares the price will be astronomical when they finally fill.   Have patience, This will happen fast when it does happen, but we really have no idea when it'll take off, and If you can HOLD HOLD HOLD  Not financial advice, I'm an ape

GameStop: Roaring Kitty may be called to testify after stock spike
I sold because it severely affected my behavior and it wasn't worth it for me
So I guess I'll get a lot of downvotes for this.  While the stock went up, so went my mood, but the opposite is also true. If you would chart my mood and compared it with the stock price there is probably a correlation of 1. During the last couple of days I felt down, I lashed out and overreacted over little things. Also I was glued to the stock price constantly.  I'm angry the hedge funds covered their shorts the way they did (market manipulation, restrictions,  etc.). I was hoping for a change today when the restrictions were lifted, and hoped for a big uptick with all of your enthusiasm, but GME is up only by a tiny amount compared to the movements during the last couple of days and AMC is down.  Therefore, I finally made the decision to sell. I'm sorry everyone, but for me this wasn't worth it anymore. I have to prioritize my mental health and my friends/family.  I wanted to hold; not for a potential future profit, but for the principle. Also for all of you. I'm sorry to disappoint. If the stock goes up again, I'll be happy for you and I'll probably regret selling for a second, but this is still the right decision for me.     Since there are many loss posts and people start to comment the number of help-hotlines: don't worry, I'm fine. I didn't put my life savings into it. It stings, but I'll be fine.
I always lose when I play hot potato. Why? CAUSE I NEVER STOP HOLDING

GME and SILVER
Its funny how all the people on this sub down played silver as a an investment to make it seem as a ploy for hedge funds to regain traction when the same people sell off the shares of GME and AMC when laddering starts and silver investors are doing fine with their stock that is now in demand
Don't worry, Gamestop is still hiring haha. Good work people 👌

if it doesn't remind you of anything let me inform you about "the tower of babel"  a tower so great it could almost reach god and the heavens but for that very reason could not exist.  it reminds me a lot of the SEC investigating GME instead of "robinhood" and the other hedgefunds.

My first DD post - shorting FOXA
FOXA releases earnings next week. Expected EPS is   They have beat earnings expectations 4 quarters in a row. They could totally beat expectations again, especially because the expectations are so modest.  But here's the kicker. Earnings were last released 11/3. For prior quarter, FOXA beat earnings expectations by   The impact on their stock? It went from   on 11/2 to   on 11/4. So despite crushing expectations for the 4th quarter in a row, the stock still dropped   I know nothing about Fox's business model except for Fox News, so I am fully retarded right now, but the prospects for Fox News are not looking good. A ton of Trump supporters pissed, Trump no longer driving viewership, the prospect of him opening a competing network, uncertainty in the future of the GOP. All signs point to it not looking great for Fox News at least.   2/12 puts are pretty cheap right now. Stock has gone up 4% today. Seems like a good day to take a short position.   My position: 5 FOXA Feb 12 '21 $31 puts @ $  (big spender, I know -- still licking my wounds from $1,800 GME loss)  Criticism of my DD welcome and encouraged.

Unpopular opinion: We did it the wrong way.
Robinhood and other brokers restricting buying everyone’s favorite meme stock was market manipulation and needs to be investigated. The fact that short interest can be at 140% needs to be looked into. Retail investors having an edge over wall street, especially after the 2008 tax payer bailout is huge and will likely change some market dynamics in the future.  If you’re among the people who have money in this play, that you are 100% comfortable losing, you’re fine.  What we are seeing right now though is exactly the reason Wall Street calls us “dumb money”. It was foreseeable that people would still get in at the $200+ level and that those exact people would end up being bagholders.  The reason behind not selling at any level was, sure, support of the cause. But you know what else played into it? Greed. And that is exactly what drives the entirety of Wall Street, the very people you’re trying to take down. Greed. Money. More of it.  No one says you can’t have it, but you cannot expect getting it when you lack any common investment knowledge.  Like taking profits. Why are people up several hundred percent on their positions and not selling part? Greed.  Why are people investing money without properly informing themselves? Fear of missing out. Hype.  It’s beginner mistakes that so many new people on wsb are making. Do you know where the money that you’re down right now goes to? Right, the smart investors that established short positions at $480 because everyone knew there is no fundamental reason for this company to be worth more than 28 billion dollars. Likely large funds.  So here is the fundamental mistake so many  of you are making. You can’t stick it to a hedge fund if it’s you losing the money in the end, and most of you are.  Please don’t take the confirmation bias of the thousands of daily posts telling you to hold. There is literally millions of members that don’t post their opinions, but these are the exact people that move the market if they’re scared. We were up 50% today and weren’t able to hold that. That’s massively bearish and indicates that people took the chance to take the smaller loss and get out.  So please, if you have money in this that you can’t afford losing, take part of it out. If you’re up, consider taking part of it out and get your girl a fucking ring or at least a nice meal at your local Wendys.  Wallstreetbets used to be looked down upon, crazy bets, wild plays, but it turns out many of those were just really good. I’m not reading anything from old school members anymore because this place has turned into a full blown mania. I love how many new people are finding out about stocks and options, but it goes a lot deeper.  We saw that we can get an edge over Wall Street and we will get there again, but we all need to play it smarter next time. Good luck to all the remaining players.

New sub for actual advice not just people blabbering about $GME
REAL QUESTION: Is $GME Over?
I’m being genuine. I know nothing about stocks. Should I sell now? Everyone keeps saying “hold the line” but that shit dipped to $53 yesterday.
Buy it up... AMC!!
Some of you hedgefund shills wanted to see my position, well here you go. 200+ shares and i will keep buying more every day. And yes, I'm holding       💰💰💰
Make sure you pull out of Robinhood because she’s a desperate b tch
Lots of FUD lately. But STILL HOLDING.
It's not much and bots will probably downvote me but fuck it. Recently most of what I'm seeing here is just bots who are pushing people to sell. We all knew the risk we were taking when we were putting our money in $GME or $AMC or $NOK, etc.  It was never about the money. Those who are holding  now even with huge losses, they could've sold at 400+ and called it a day. This WAS NEVER ABOUT THE MONEY. It was about telling those HFs that they can't manipulate us forever. Even if they DID cover their shorts, They'd still lost a ton of money.  They walked free from what happened in 2008, and that's why they need to know that people can stand up to them and risk it all.  I'll fuckin watch it go back to ZERO dollars and not give a single fuck. Money comes and goes, I'll make more.  Note: This is not a financial advice.  Edit: For those who are saying it's all about the money, The people who sold at a loss or are blaming this subreddit or bla bla bla, They were aware of the risks. Even if they didn't do their own DD, They shouldn't have put in more than they can afford to lose. The ones holding knew the risks and they put in what they can. So STFU about telling them they're wrong and fuck off, they know what they're doing.     Edit 3: Even if this was all for nothing and I lose it all. I've learned a LOT this past few weeks. I'll keep holding because it'll always serve as a reminder to me of this beautiful times we're living in. Say whatever you want, I have money for food and rent, this will always be a funny story to tell.
Dear idiots still buying + holding $AMC
You smart. You loyal.     😎

Read this and you will understand why you should hold!!!     I like the stocks and I like you people that is all, not a financial advisor!!!!
From 68k to   million in less than 11 months. Should I sell and take a breather?
Not GME but I bought PSGR months ago expecting retards (like us) to mistake it for Ackmans Pershing (months before it was listed) and I’m up 100% on my 100$ investment.

The gme bleed has been so consistent that I feel like I would be a dumbass not to try and make a quick buck. Only problem is I don’t wanna suck the toesies of our billionaire overlords. Would I be hurting the people holding if I try it?
You can deduct any money you lost in stocks from your taxes.
Hello autists. As you all know, stocks on GME,  AMC, NOK, etc are going to the shiter and people are losing thousands of dollars. You can deduct these losses on your taxes. Just subtract the capital gains from the capital losses and report these losses to the Internal revenue service. The Internal revenue service should be able to give you a deduction. I haven't tried this for myself or anyone I know who tried this. Let me know if this works. You can deduct up to $3,000 per year.   Please hold these stocks if you can, let's keep these diamond hands. This is extra motivation  Sources:

If you sold GME this past week, my financial banking friend explains why you made the biggest mistake
I know this week the market has been treating us very differently than last week, and some weaker minded ones of us may have sold at a loss, but it's often during these highly emotional times we lose scope of the bigger picture. DO NOT SELL GME.   My good friend is a financial banker at a very big hedge fund (can't reveal the name for security reasons of course) and I was able to secretly record him breaking down the hedge fund trading algorithm (spoiler: there are factorials and exponentials involved! very complex math) and I KID you not, at the heart of the whole equation was GME. Video link in comments below  At first I didn't even understand how the hell that even makes sense, but this goddamn whistleblower explained it perfectly the farther into the video you go. GME is a HOT buy at an amazing discount and this is coming from someone on the inside.  Super helpful in this video how he explains why GME is a great stock using simple geometry. Keep in mind, taking factorials and converting them to geometric sequences isn't something just any man can do. This involves critical thinking and machine learning.   Our good friend Neil may have died some years ago, but we must continue to follow in his legacy. LET'S TAKE THIS THING BACK UP TO THE MOON.

GME -- a look at the situation on outstanding shares
tl;dr GME is a ticking time bomb  From GameStop's last 10-Q filing in 12/20:    Number of shares of $.001 par value Class A Common Stock outstanding as of December 1, 2020:   69,746,960    Latest news today from Reuters courtesy of S3 Partners:    "As of Thursday’s close,    million  shares were shorted versus   million a day earlier, according to S3. GameStop short interest, a measure of stock price and the number of shares shorted, stood at $  billion."  Let's for a second take the number provided by S3 Partners at face value.   million shares are currently still short.  Looking at the math:  Outstanding shares is 69,746,960  Source Shares held by Institutions/Funds       114,032,731   85,119,189   78,969,848   77,438,127   76,870,000   62,005,047  Reminder that the above  does not  include: insider ownership, public/retail (you, I, and everyone else), etc. We may not know the float, but we know the outstanding shares. The numbers just don't add up.  It's clear no matter which estimate you look at, the situation is dire since the shorts will eventually have to cover their postion. Maybe not all at once, but any catalyst/good news will only put more pressure with a steady trajectory up.  It appears the squeeze was gimped and an inevitable squeeze has yet to run its course.  Again, nothing about the numbers above have factored you and I into the picture, which you can imagine only compounds the situation. GME looks to be a ticking time bomb waiting to happen. Thoughts/comments are welcome if I'm missing anything.  Disclaimer: This is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold. Sources have been included and encouraged to be verified.  Position: 43 shares  Post history: Don't bother, this is my first post/comment on the sub as I've just been lurking and upvoting for the past week trying to make sense of everything.
Is it manipulation when Robinhood tags articles with stock quotes for seemingly unrelated securities?
The whole time those silver articles on Robinhood had stock quotes for GME and AG. In fact any article about GME, Meme stocks, Reddit, silver, or the squeeze all tagged with GME and AG quotes. Now why would that be the case? By what process do those tags appear? Is it automated or is there a selection process by an internal group or individual?
Investing in Clubhouse ( alpha exploration co )
Hello my fellow apes   Is there any creative way to invest in Clubhouse ? (It's not officially listed ) I personally see a lot of potential but nothing is certain so Investing in it would be a great bet. Not an advice of course, just my opinion and question of retarded crayon eater.
What I learned from the GME mania
Never ever invest in a stock if you do not personally believe in it, no matter how attractive the potential returns may be. I bet you that the people who made the most money from Tesla were the ones who were just devoted to the company, because of this they are able to HOLD the stock no matter what and ride out any negativity. GME may also be a great company one day and those who stuck around will be rewarded. For those who only jumped in to make a quick buck my advice is: find your own stock, a company you can relate to, that makes products you genuinely like and has the potential to show massive growth in the next 10-20 years. You will see how easy it is to ignore the bullshit then and any dips will be potential opportunities to buy more!

Bagholder Support - Read This to Feel Better.
You're going to be okay. If you need someone to tell you right now, you're going to be okay, here it is.   Try saying it out loud. "I am going to be okay" and take a deep breath into it. Really feel it.  You are alive. You have a long life ahead of you. You made a choice based on something you believed in at the time, and it didn't pan out. That's okay. There's nothing wrong with you. These things happen. You are still a smart person. I believe in your ability to come back from this.   Please do talk about this with someone. Bottling this up will eat at you in an unhealthy way. Whatever you're feeling - let yourself really feel it right now - with others you trust to provide supportive ears, familial, friends, professional therapist, and/ or even friendly internet strangers that allow you to feel safe. It will allow the healing to start today and not years from now.  Please do not run to whatever your vice is to numb yourself to ignore this - whether that is booze, weed, sex, porn, social media, whatever your vice is. Now is not the time. Take a shower, or even a bath. Slow down. Breathe. Drink water. Make sure you eat.     There will always be someone there for you, you just have to ask.

ELI5 What is the deal with aerospace stocks?
The aerospace industry has been struggling through the pandemic, obviously. But shouldn’t there be a lot of interest in aerospace stock right now? I’ve been investing in aircraft manufacturing for the last 6 months and they’ve all just been stumbling forward. To me it seems like companies like Airbus and Boeing should be doing really well because people would be investing in stock now in order to reap the benefits of their inevitable recovery once air travel rejuvenates - but these stocks seem to really struggle. Is there a factor I’m not seeing?   Boeing has some additional issues with their 737 max crashes - but shouldn’t that help draw interest in people waiting for the inevitable recovery?? A company like that HAS to recover, why aren’t investors buying up stock like these?  Context: I’m NOT experienced with investing, but I’m pretty familiar with the aerospace industry (I’m a grad student studying aerospace composite materials). I have a mostly aerospace portfolio because that’s what I know, but I’m really struggling to gain any profits here, I’ve basically just broken even over the last year.

An Emotional Support Message for Silver bugs
Quick Forward - do not sell a single share of GME / AMC. This is not a note shilling precious metals.  I've been cruising WSB and spending a lot of time doing financial research to try to make the best decisions for me and my family. At least the best decisions a degenerate ape is capable of     .  During my time researching primarily via YouTube videos and research articles on SA I came to know a number of figures in the precious metals community.  These individuals work very hard and put in a lot of thankless hours despite the precious metals markets being among the most manipulated in the world. There was a lot of buzz last week in that community because of the garbage misdirect tactics run by CNBC, which made me feel bad.  It isn't your turn yet, we're kinda busy holding down some hedge funds at the moment but know that there are plenty of folks that haven't forgotten about you.  Artificially suppressing the price of commodities is a crime and if the rumors are true it deserves much more investigation and penalty than the pathetic fines collected thus far.  I'm referring to this story among other things.    Obligatory closing note:  GME

Y’all were geniuses on gme and amc in the beginning, but we all held for to long, I’m a victim to that as well. Good luck in the future and I hope your losses gets filled up as soon as possible.

For GME, it’s all over but the crying.
Today’s dead cat bounce isn’t going to last very long. If you hold GME, you should get out as soon as possible. Save your money for the next squeeze play. I don’t know who or what that will be, but I’m looking forward to it. But in my opinion, GME has now jumped the shark. J/S

The system is rigged.. kind of
I've been seeing a lot of comments here from people who are new to trading talking about how "The system is rigged" and "I always knew this was rigged." I just wanted to clarify some points.   There's no way for retail to totally beat the hedge funds and the big guys with a short term time horizon like we've had here. As we saw with Silverlake and some of the hedge funds that made tons of money off GME, AMC, etc.   Now I know what I'm going to say next is not very wallstreetbets but it's something that the people who are new to investing need to hear. When you stretch out your time horizon the odds flip. If you look at the average returns of hedge funds since 2008 they don't beat the market. That means all you have to do to make more money than them is buy index funds.     about how the little guy can win.  Put your money in index funds and over time you're almost guaranteed to win. I know it's not flashy and it won't change your life tomorrow. But don't let this drive you away from the market for the rest of your life. Because if it does you will miss out on enormous amounts of future wealth.
Law Offices Of Gary R Carlin APC Adds Six Hedge Funds, Nine Brokers, And Thirteen Stocks To Robinhood Class Action
We can possibly reverse our $GME losses by restricting our shares from being borrowed. Read on ...
It seems like the shorts have an almost unlimited access to borrowing shares to short them (sell them). With $GME it's a win-win game for them. They borrow the shares at the current price. They dump them on the market. The price of $GME goes down, they re-purchase at a lower price and pocket the difference. So, they can slowly drive the price down and make multiple short-sales on the way down.  There is a way to make their life much more difficult right now. I've now verified this with two brokerages: TD Ameritrade and Fidelity.  We have to disallow our $GME shares from being borrowed by the short sellers. How do we do this? We have to remove the "margin" feature from our account. The "margin" feature allows you to borrow money from the brokerage to buy shares long. It also allows you to borrow shares from other brokerage customers to short the shares. If you are a responsible investor, you don't want to buy on margin. This is a really bad idea. Now, you may want to try to short shares yourself, but shorting is a very dangerous game, as the downside on a short position is virtually unlimited. With shorting shares, even if you are borrowing less than you have cash in your account, you still must have the margin feature enabled. If you have the margin feature enabled, you automatically allow others to borrow your shares for shorting.  If you want to try to fight back now, this is what you can do:  1. Call your brokerage and tell them you want to restrict your shares from being lent to others for short selling. Expect them to tell you that you need to remove the "margin" feature from your account. 2. You can request right then and there that the margin feature be removed from your account. This will require that you don't have any pending or waiting orders right now and that  you cannot trade out of that account for two business days. (at least those are TD Ameritrade requirements).  That's it. If you are not planning to sell or buy more shares in the next few business days, and if you call today to request that the "margin" feature be removed from your account, you will start fighting the short sellers back.  Now, if you have already bought $GME on margin, then you can't disable the "margin" feature. You should never have bought $GME on margin. If you have pending orders, you will most likely not be able to disable the "margin" feature. If you are not planning to hold $GME for the next two days and are planning your exit from $GME, you should not be disabling the "margin" feature now.

What are we doing?!   We are standing around with our retarded hands in our pathetic pockets and watching as GME and AMC go down in flames?!   They need our help! We can do better than this!

I'd rather buy 50,000 shares at $  than have to buy a bag of popcorn and a drink for $392...  Now retard up and pull yourselves together! We need to liquidate all of our other positions and jump on AMC and GME and send these (still insanely shorted) stocks to the freaking MOON!!!!!!!!!  Who is with me?!

I just wanted to say this
Ma dad gave me €500 to invest in stocks for the first time. He wanted me to learn the trade and just have fun. I bought 12@$70 and kept them after the squeeze( I knew I fucked up) and sold them at 90 usd a couple of days ago. I was bummed out all week because I wanted to make my dad proud and if I had sold them at the peak I could have given him some money or bought presents for him and my mom but no. He saw that I was upset and told me it’s just a learning experience and that I will do better in the future. It immediately made me happier and I will continue to learn. I also just got my exam grades back and passed everything so that’s also a happy moment. I just wanted to share this with you guys because this is my favourite sub on here and wanted to show you that losing money isn’t the end of the world. Peace out retards

theyre banking on your impatience
im not a financial advisor and this is basically me just assessing everything thats happened based on this sub, also i like the stock.  you can bet your so called    that every single solitary share that you sell is immediately being scooped up by big money to use against us. these suits have been playing this game for decades and its no secret that they know every trick in the book. the only element that had them by the balls in recent events was the element of surprise, and i bet you could be damn sure theyd be even more surprised to see not one of us sell our shares.  if you mentioned once that you had    and you sell at the first hint of profit or loss beyond your original "plan", you deserve to be banned and youre probably a cuck. if you buy more, youre the guy whos cucking the toilet paper handed n00bs. but with big money scooping up every share they can like i stated, do you want hairy suited beasts cucking you? or do you want to show off your diamond cock and hold your wad until we hit 5k, 10k, or beyond?  its up to you, apes. the media has made it clear that there is still a HUGE number of short positions open, way more than volkswagen. do you want to be the reason we fall, or do you want to make history with your fellow warriors? again, i am not a financial advisor and i dont recommend throwing your life savings at this   you really really really fucking love it. idk ur call. i love u - 5 diamond shares @ $

Their Plan Is Working
Their whole plan with having RH restrict trading was to end the momentum. It wasn’t to cover their short position. They are going to be able to cover their short position only as people sell. By having people bail, they are making shares available to cover their short position. But they are also creating so much FUD that they are going to have people exiting as it climbs before it peaks just to cover their loss.   HOLD YOUR FUCKING SHARES.   GME SQUEEZE OR BUST            💪   Edit:  Not financial adviser and I am retarded.

Remember To BE VIGILANT
Guys there are psychopaths on both sides trying to play the game, but they’re playing their own game for their own benefit. These people will try to break you down with  anything .   It doesn’t matter if it’s right or wrong, they have learn to utilize FUD and they’ll say anything to you to get you to do what they want.  They aren’t playing by the same rules, they have the ability to reduce their/ or numb their own FUD, and will take you for a ride and then discard you.    LASTLY, REMEMBER.    For GME. Realise that FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) are just states of mind. Depending on who raises you or who you will surround yourself with, no matter what, make an effort to treat each and every moment or opportunity that you may receive with a grounded perspective and objectively.  Also, be able to be your own therapist, because the sooner you realize that who and what you learn will shape who you become, and that nothing is inherently known or given. But, are rather things that come up, or you will have a take on, or a perspective that may not be necessarily true or valid.  You’re human, prone to error at some point, that’s fine. So always try to see that you were being fair, grounded, respectable, mature, in all these things will help you focus and guide you into a direction that would put your life in a better position.  Take solace that this happens to everybody. There is not an individual who will not face this, with yourself and your own consciousness in your mind type of feeling. That you only have yourself and don’t try to explain that to anybody.  You know, be able to rationalize it, to break it down, to contextualize it, but use it to better yourself and others, please.  If you’re like a super young person reading this, or just any other person, like me :), you may see it as themes of “self-actualization”,  “third eye”, or “vibes.”  Well, that’s what you shoot for as a person. Your parents or friends/family ideally would help you achieve it. If they don’t, get new family and friends.  If not, you may want to achieve this sooner rather than later to deal with the realities and harshness of the world or you will SUFFER more than you would have too, rather than if you had the tools in your toolbox.  I’m only 22, and some people learn this as kids, younger, older; some never achieve it, now that’s hell.  Btw voice to text, for the horrible grammar and structure.
Seems the jig is up
Like, the price keeps on falling for AMC and GME. It never really did much of anything on BB and NOK and others. It's time to maybe admit most people got out and this fun little ride is over?  I'm expecting lots of downvotes here, but I'll say I'm still holding and support the idea of the movement wholeheartedly. But. It feels like it's over.
COME ON GUYS KEEP GOING DIAMOND HANDS BABY
I'm 14 so I can't really help out cuz you know, I'm 14.. But after finding this sub, I've realized that bunch of you guys are here only for some internet points, when there's really very few who are here to actually spread the cause. There are some pretty damn bad people in this world doing this for personal gain, and people like us are doing stuff to stop that. Even if you buy on share of GME, you're helping everyone by 1 more stock, and you are helping the world become a place cleaner of the people tyring to hold the money away from the poor. Hold the share, this war isn't over yet soldiers.
Robinhood trying to win us back with cold hard cash
Stop with your blatantly poor advertising, Wall Street. WE'RE NOT LEAVING.
Has anyone else noticed that more than half the time the retards in the media talk about GameStop they literally call it “GameStock” mid-sentence and everyone keeps going about their business like they aren’t more retarded that us apes...
I bought GME last week, this week the Texas Workforce Commission is trying to bankrupt   I'M STILL HOLDING!
Preface: I am retarded, yes I know. I unknowingly spent more than I could afford to lose.  So, late last week I had $1500 in savings and really liked the stock, so I thought let's see if I can double what I have. I am unemployed and have been for a few months. I probably should have been smarter given my situation, but I thought YOLO instead. Ive been using unemplotment to pay my bills, which are pretty significant, while I search for a job. My career has been wrecked by Covid making it difficult to find a job. Then, this week an incredibly horrendous situation occurred with my unemployment.  The issue is that they are claiming fraud on my account for not verifying my ID within a week of when it was requested. I sent it a day late and now they want me to pay back the entire $4800 that I have been given. Obviously, this is catastrophic for me as I am still without work and don't have the means to pay this, not to mention that it was a simple mistake that could be easily resolved. However, contact with TX Unemployment seems impossible, and my appeals online are going nowhere.  They are asking for the money to be paid soon, and I don't have the means. This has the potential to ruin me, and frankly seems so ridiculous!  Regardless, I want to be optimistic that $GME might come to my rescue. Its not like if I sold now it would make a dent in how much they want anyways. This is my first time investing and I don't know what I am doing, but I am in it now. I am gonna stick it out, maybe it will fix everything.
CALLING FORTH ANCIENT HANDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Calling Stonk Team 6
23andme to go public
Aside from amc, bb and gme to go to the moon. 23 and me is expected to go public in a merger with VGAC VG ACQUISITION CORP SHS CL. Thoughts?
Y'all gonna need some 🔥 $FIRE 🔥 to get to the moon.  🌕
Check out $FIRE or $SPRWF. Cheap, cheap stock with huge upside. Recently underwent a management overhaul, starting to turn a profit, and it's shorted hard. This isn't a $0-$100 short squeeze stock, but definitely should be around $2, which for you monkey brained retards is ~800% increase. Plus, federal legalization is coming and these guys have some good shit.
Robinhood is shook we all leaving.
There is nothing glorious about LOSING
I'm gonna be super fucking FRANK here. YALL just a bunch of   idiotic retarded degenerates   with   0 fucking financial literacy   who happened to hold bags and pretending everything is alright while others already existed. It's sad to watch. It's over. Go home and suck on your mama tits dummies.

Pulling out of Robinhood issues
Howdy retards, I sold all of the airlines stock I had in Robinhood to switch to Fidelity, however I’m getting an error message when I try to transfer the money to a different account. I’ve tried to contact Robinhood for 3 days straight and I have gotten no response. Any advice?
Negative Nancys get paid if you interact with them
$SKLZ reaching a 52 week high
I’m down -81% what happens if it goes down -100% but I never sell? And then it goes to the    moon will I still have my shares?
GME and AMC appear to be mismatched!
Check the charts, they look like they're starting to diverge
HOLD
Hold you beautiful retards.  Foreheads like a drive-in movie but we love you!
Yall Celebrate way too early
Can yall stop with the posts of the price moving up, everyone on this sub is watching the charts. Yall celebrate and then it crashes and look like clowns. Im holding too but everytime yall post and then it dips people get scared it wont hit that point again.     70 @ 104
AMC is almost a safe bet even if the squeeze doesn't happen. If we don't go to the moon the best thing that happen to me in this whole thing was finding AMC.
financial advice. I just like the stock
APPARENTLY DEAD CATS BOUNCE PRETTY FREAKIN HIGH
MUST'VE DROPPED THAT CAT FROM THE MOON, I'M BETTING IT CAN BOUNCE HIGHER
$AMC is great and all, but to all my Canadians  (and everyone else!) out there, give $CGX a quick look too!
Before shit hit the fan last march was @ $30, hit a low $5 last October, slowly climbing up but loosely following trends of $AMC.  Might be good value? But don't know.      Is anyone else going to flock to see every movie available when we're able to?       have no clue what I'm doing. This is not financial advice. I just love going to the movies.

Game dev software, indie devs aren't going everywhere, digital goods are profitable af, and the market overcorrected to the news about slow revenue growth.  Only had $100 to throw at it, but I'll throw more in as it becomes available.  Easily $160 a share by a year from now.

HOW TO COUNTER SHORT LADDER ATTACKS
Listen GMEorillas, I figured out how we can counter all these ladder attacks.  When the price starts falling we all sell.  Once the ladder attack stalls we all buy back in.  This way we can buy more at the new lower manipulated price.  Let's beat the hedge assholes at there own game  🤲🏽  =       WE WILL SEE THE MOON  APES STRONG TOGETHER DIAMOND HANDS

Gme group got silenced down?
Just me that got banned for 6h+ from posting positive things about gme? And could not comment anything under that time.. is this why it felt like everyone gave up? Because we that still in the game got silenced down? Sorry bad English 🐵
Why are there so many trends like this? The sales all hit at once, declining, the second to last goes up, and the last one goes back down. It’s a pattern I’ve been seeing all day.
buy Nok @   and GME @ 50?
:/    maybe GME @ 42?
The Stop-Loss Play
One question we need to ask RE: the dirty tricks being played around $GME and $AMC is ‘Qui Bono’ - who benefits?  And how?  With this in mind, I realized that one way for the HFs to triage - especially in a battle against retail traders (many of whom are novices and/or have a lot to lose) - is to force stop-loss calls.  Traders may place well-intentioned stop-loss triggers on their shares in an effort to avert disaster.  But this exposes a vulnerability to exploitation, especially in a short squeeze situation where prices can have crazy swings.  If the price drops, this can cause stop-losses to trigger and a bunch of shares suddenly go out of the retail investor’s hands and up for sale at a discount.  This is counter-productive to the BUY and HOLD strategy that many (including myself) are using.  GME and AMC are extremely volatile, and prices can spike and plummet.  Be careful that your stop loss triggers don’t betray you.  This is not investment advice; I am not a financial services professional and I’m pretty sure I can see the color blurple.  I like the stock.      Disclosure: Holding 25 $GME @ $184
I JUST THINK IT'S FUNNY HOW
All of the meme stocks were skyrocketing prior to 9   today, and immediately after these stocks started to plummet. BB started to plummet to until around 9:30   Think of what can be the most advantageous thing for them to do right now! They know that we aren't falling for the trap because we can extrapolate information from data, so now they are manipulating the data that we extrapolate information from.  DONT FALL FOR THE BLACKBERRY TRAP! STILL HOLD ON TO GME AMC BB NOK  ALSO if anyone wants to buy my stocks I'm personally selling GME @ 600, AMC @ 200, BB @ 70, NOK @ 50. I WILL NOT AND AM NOT SELLING FOR LOWER. IF THERE IS ANYTHING I KNOW HOW TO DO, IT IS NOT MOVE. AND I AM NOT MOVING!!!  DIAMOND HANDS TO THE MOON

Short shares available
Yesterday after close this site reported 950k shares available. Right now there are under 95k.  Shorters are still opening positions. Not sure exactly sure how share available works, but in one day potentially nearly 1 million new shorts opened and most probably around $75.   Probably not significant, but a point to track.  Edit: forgot to add link.
Would most people agree the instant Robinhood started to restrict shares....
was the moment people should have bailed if they were in the green? And many novice investors couldn't put 2+2 together to figure that out?  Or was there a valid argument for staying in? I can't think of one.

SORRY I'M NOT A PROPHET 🦧
The amount of whining troglodytes that have come out of their   moldy caves when GME started to fall is astounding. FUD really was taking over some of you huh?  "Oh you should've sold at 450! Now you look like an idiot haha so glad I sold!"   You guys went from spamming diamond hand emojis talking about ride or die fuckery and as soon as shit hit the fan for awhile you bail and start shitting on holders? You jumped into a situation you had no knowledge about, took the advice of some random retards, and are upset you got burned. I get it, but you know what? It happens! This is a fucking casino, we had an edge but that didn't make us infallible. You hopped on a bandwagon held together by four creaking wheels and scotch tape. (It did have some wicked flames painted on the sides though)   Hmm yes 👍 I apologize that I didn't forsee a market restriction from Robinhood coming, a full on smear   by mainstream media, and all around blatant market manipulation that won't be punished by the SEC. Did I expect dirty plays? Of course I did, there was a shit ton of money on the line. What I didn't expect is how transparent and drastic it was going to be.   That's life though! We'll always be at the bottom of the food chain. The idea is to latch yourself onto to a fat shark titty and coast through life on that bitch. Sometimes the titty bites back though. It be how it do.   Now with that being said... you can suck your gut in and quit being a whiny bitch, take the loss and learn to cope with your new life lesson... OR you can fucking hold and see what happens next like the rest of us! Enough of the moping and kicking the holders for having bigger balls and smaller brains than you (may God put your teen angst to rest soon)  What can I say  ‍♂️ I like the fucking stock 🤚  and this fights not over no matter how many times you scribble it on the walls with your half eaten crayons. Bitch and moan if you want, my retard meters set to 100 and though the stock may be down, I'm higher than a kite 😎                           this isn't financial advice you fuckwits.
I just turned this bitch up to 11!
No seriously I've only got 11 stocks now, but I'm not selling. 10 @ $110, 1 @ $64. Doing my part. Plus I'm retarded and just like the stock...
Retards, you know what to do.

Baby ape still holding strong! TO THE MOON!
Just some foreshadowing of the upcoming launch
THIS APE IS NOT LEAVING!
Stop thinking about GME, AMC, BB, NOK in terms of the market and look at it in terms of normal human behavior.
The short squeeze is currently underway and is a signal that a predictable pattern of events will occur. Humans are predictable, especially in aggregate.   Humans are almost all the same and act incredibly similar to each other. So, if the pattern repeats, it will repeat. None of us are special.   I bet on GME because humans are simple predictable creatures. This pattern of this event has been established. There is no way around it but through and we know what that looks like.   GME to the moon.

RH Stole From Me
After transferring accounts to TD Ameritrade, RH deactivates the account. But when I was comparing my shares, RH kept about $800 of my active investments still running and it was not fully moved to my TDA. I have tried contacting RH about this but god knows how long they’ll take. I’ve tried selling them or just depositing into my bank but since the account is deactivated I’m not able to do anything.
My brain every time the prices dip so I buy more. Still holding

It’s not much but it’s honest work. In at 350 and 300 or so, holding till i can see Uranus...      🤚
If we hold we will win right ?
GME is done, but what’s next?
If you guys want to actually have an impact, how does your movement advance forward? How do we, as a society, use this to change things for the better in the future? How do we actually manifest a world where the little guys can win?
GME Gamma Squeeze, 7+ million shares left to hedge
That's probably what caused our early spike to the $95 before shorts panicked. Right now it's a fight between puts and calls at strike 60 to stay in the money.   says the longs and shorts will fight over their strikes with the highest volume as expiration approaches, ultimately making the the maximum number of calls expire OTM.  But there are 89,000 call options expiring friday from $60-$120 that MMs will have to hedge as the price increase. Shorts are going to do anything they can to keep it down below that to save themselves.  There are another 60,000 puts that are expiring today that market makers will have to unhedge as the price rises, also contributing to a gamma squeeze.  There are another 90k calls from $120 to $800 that are almost completely unhedged, but I'm also not expecting us to pump all the way up to the 800s to squeeze those so i've excluded them from the main numbers.  These are personal opinions/my guesses and not investment advice. I've also got so much GME that I can't do anything but stare at this stupid chart all day.     TL;DR:   In total that's 15,000,000 million shares they'd have to buy today of which they've only hedged about 3 million so far (rough estimate based on eyeballing the delta). That's a whole lot of squeeze if we can find the juice.   Edit for the requested rocket ships
Lucid Motors Price Target

EXRO Technologies - A potential multi-bagger in the EV sector
Exro Technologies, a company out of Canada has recently generated a lot of hype as a potential big player in the EV battery market.  Exro is a clean tech company that has developed a new class of controller that dynamically enables multiple power settings in a single motor making it faster, stronger, and smarter. Exro's advanced control technology, the Coil Driver, expands the capabilities of electric motors and powertrains by improving performance, efficiency, and reducing costs. Exro currently has 17 granted patents and 18 patents pending on its innovative technology.  Exro combines its patented software and hardware with in-house design, development testing, and final assembly at its Calgary Innovation Center for the most cost-effective solutions.  Exro is putting the intelligence into energy management and seeks to accelerate the global transition to clean energy.  I will summarize what I know and what I have learned from my investigation  1. As per CEO, their Projections are: Revenue should start from end of 2021. EBITDA +ve from 2023 2. Business model -> If its a low volume high value, they said they could manufacture themselves. If its volume business , they will either engage Contract manufacture it or do a licensing deal with OEMs who take care of manufacturing. Most business will be done in the license model 3. MOAT : They hold patents in different regions. They claim, each customer's work will be customized design for the customer and since their main work is software, they believe it will take years for someone to reverse engineer it. 4. Competitors - CEO claims no competition. The problem statement is widely known. My personal investigation to date suggest that there is/are other competitor(s) around, but they have their own solution. Question is, who has best efficiency & range and can they start commercializing it soon?  There are many ways seen to solve the problem :  i) Motor companies who use expensive Permanent magnet motors (made of rare earth metals). These are expensive but performance is great  ii) Semiconductor technology: Silicon-Mobility a French private startup, are working on same problem. Their solution is based on similar, software tech but this through   is micro controller but directly on the motor. Silicon-Mobility claims they can better performance & torque by 10-30%. Exro is also same or more. Silicon-Mobility do have couple of good partners (Valeo a auto ancillary and AVL autotech company). But IMO, they are a bit behind in commercialization, at least from what I know. It will be one to watch out for in   they ever go public.  End of the day, the electrification and solving the Differential Torque problem in Electric Car wont be solved alone by 1 company for entire world.  Exro has so many use cases and the opportunity size is huge.  Their current plan is to use these prototype partnerships and get the test benchmark data. Suppose Potencia testing gives benchmark data for electric car (converted from ICE by Potencia) and a electric Van. The data they get out of this testing will then be used and benchmarked against commercially available electric car data. If Exro finds enough proof that their tech is better, then they can go to the bigger OEMs like GM or Ford or whoever and get seat at the table.  If Potencia works, then Exro's target IMO should be likes of GM & Ford who want to do the volume business. They also have several partners listed on their site here:      The latest press release is super bullish  , and shows they are about to enter the commercialization phase with their first order of the Coil Driver -    This news came out of nowhere as LAND was not a partner previously, and today, the stock is hitting all time highs on this news.  Finally, here is a large document full of DD put together by the community at r/ExroTechnologies \- Have a look!     Disclosure: I own the shares. This is still a microcap, it's not a sure thing and the next 12 months are crucial for them - play according to your Personal Risk Tolerance.
So many new accounts in here telling us how we should use our money
I can spend my money how I want and if I want to hold my shares until it hits $0 then im gonna do that so there's no point in you HF dipshits trying to convince me otherwise😏
Houston, we have a problem...
Whose to say Hedge Funds won't just be given an indefinite amount of time to cover shorts?
It seems that they can openly, freely manipulate the stocks as they please and I think it's in the interests of the powers that be to not let a rich, powerful entity they're probably entrenched with, go down because of retail investors.

Small spikes due to shorts closing?
Could there be a chance that Melvin and friends are artificially driving the price down and using the lowered price to close their positions? Hence what we saw today? It would make sense to mitigate (as best they could) the massive loss they would get if the price soared past 1000 eg. Just a rinse and repeat of today?
Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.
What we learned today is very bullish!
Ok first off to the smooth brain apes that held. You may have more wrinkles than everyone thought.   Once restrictions were lifted GME broke out! What does this tell us.   First off you dipshits still haven’t moved your cash to another broker (fidelity possibly E TRADE don’t do TD and webull shut it down again today as did RH I believe).   Second once it was restricted it tanked again.   Third and very importantly the market tanked during that time, this is very important. SPY lost $  and quickly recovered once restricted again.   What do these things mean?   Momentum is not lost, there is still high demand for these stocks BUT we are still restricted because we aren’t moving our liquid capital to another broker.   There is still a high percentage of short interest. If there wasn’t the whole market wouldn’t shit the bed if it was just retail running the stock up.   The shorts are hard at work bringing it back down now that they control the playground again.   My take away? This is still the play. Move your fucking money to a real brokerage this weekend and be ready for next week. Keep your shares in RH and the like, but stop any further transactions.   Some of you wrinkle brained 🤡 made a shit load of money and sold before the huge drop. Obligatory Congrats and fuck you. But if you still want in this play toss 1/4 of your winnings at this discounted price. You get a second ride on the rollercoaster.   This is going to/may be a long term play BUT if we move to a big boy brokerage house they won’t be able to stop it!   This is NOT financial advice just a general observation of today’s events. Do your own DD and play only what you can afford to lose at your own risk.   $GME
Anyone else find it weird that the price rocketed this morning and not a single circuit breaker?
54% in 20 minutes and nothing at all. I feel like other days we were getting stopped like crazy during similar runs. Bought more holding!!                          Edit: Well apparently I really am just a dumb ape LOL.  Edit2: Ok guys I was clearly just not paying attention you can stop upvoting now. Enough people know my incompetence already.  Edit3: Fuck..
Buy dip for moon ride   🏻   🦧🦧
CNN telling that GME is still dipping
I love those people which came for quick buck
Those which bought high, sold low and now they are negative AF instead taking their toilet paper hands and getting the f out of here.  I came about 3/4 year ago. Lurking, being jealous of people throwing tens, or hundreds of thousands away on yolo plays, while my salary is 1500$ a month. I am 22 and I am currently at red 1032$. I have left 600$ from my 2 years of hard savings (bag of GME and 2 AAPL). Nobody will give me back that money here, no one gives as hit how much I fucked myself (did kinda a lot), even if that would be like lunch money for them. But I took the risk and now I am holding either to make buck, or sink with the ship and regret hopping in the casino.  Stop being mad because you bought lotto ticket, threw it away without scratching the last number on it. This sub was something I never experienced before, when I joined. But now its worse than my FB, or Instagram main page.   As far as I am aware, the posts I saw years back, this was always casino.   We will be at least bit smarter apes on next Tuesday, because on this GME there are actually some technicals.  Spamming does not help.  Hold, or if you can't take it, leave and hold.  Also to make this post interesting for the soft brains on here.         GME 2 @ 360 1 @ 263 1 @ 221 3 @ 81
I wouldn't know how to sell even if I wanted to. Accidentally keep hitting buy  🏻‍♂️
What Would Happen If We All Went Short?
Maybe not to the moon, but we'd make a crater?
BOUGHT MORE GME! I see    🧨🧨 COMING SOON!! %-75 —>%-63. Play offense!

How can I buy BOTY in UK, I've tried 4 different apps today and none have it.

Why does it firstly go up like shit, then they restrict trading and after that it was so obvious that I will slowly go down again... fckers
y'all like nuggets?
Y'all like nuggets? Just wonderin.

First time in stocks and bought 377 GME! Regards from all the way Turkey!   🤲🏼🤲🏼
Your squeeze DD was ammunition for the big players.
The offense was shouted from the rooftops for the defense to counter behind the scenes. And the moving of the goal posts every day decayed your holders.   I’m still convinced GME would’ve hit $1000 and beyond, but the moves by retail brokerages were coordinated tactics based off of a playbook that ape gang handed them on a diamond platter.   For everyone that bought high and claiming diamond hands, I don’t think you understand the narrative. You’re holding for the squeeze, while all the OGs are holding because it’s a great investment at the end of the day and can play out in the long term. These are investors that bought shortly after, or with DFV, not at the top calling him God.   As someone who bought in at 112 and saw the writing on the wall and pulled some actual tendies, good luck, downvote me and have your fun. If you bought high and are convinced “any day now”, you’re trapped in a small cave.   Also “look at the DDs” and “don’t care, HOLDING    ” is cult level self deception, look at Q.   Anyways. $ARKK $ICLN $ROKU long spreads all day baby.
Donkey Kong (DKNG) coming to the Superbowl near you this weekend. Get in before it moons!
Hello, my fellow retards.  I know you guys can't read for shit, so I'm putting the   tl;dr   right here.    tldr :     Donkey Kong's big dick swinging is gonna take us to the moon sooner or later. When you want to board the rocket is your choice. I've already strapped in and have my helmets on.  Retard play for the gamblers out there-     DKNG 70$ 2/12   \- To the moon or bust.  Safe plays for all the pussies out there -    DKNG 70$ Jan '22      DKNG 90$ Jan '23    \                                                 -  Okay now lets get to the good parts. Here are the catalysts -     SUPERBOWL is this week baby :     Do I care about the Superbowl ? Fuck no. Is Tom Brady still playing ? Fuck yeah. Pretty sure you've seen massive advertisements for DKNG this week. Superbowl for them is like Singles day for BABA or Black Friday for AMZN. You bet people and their grandmothers are gonna gamble. And they're gonna gamble hard. It's gonna be all over the news in the US, and you bet it's gonna be all over the world if Tom Brady wins another one of these. As is tradition, Donkey Kong is gonna come out next week, swinging his big dick, bragging about their numbers, which are gonna be higher than Snoop Dog on a Saturday. You know what's gonna happen next ? Hint, starts with F and ends with O. You guessed it right, FOMO over the hottest player in gambling right now - and that is where the money starts pouring in, enough to send us into orbit. This is also their first Superbowl as DKNG, and it is gonna be massive.    Mommy Cathie is IN !     You bet mommy Cathie is into gambling. She has smelled blood and ARK is in ( . Let me quote here for you simps -   > ARK Invest has taken its first position in DraftKings and believes that online gambling could grow by 10 times its current size.  You think Mommy Cathie is in it to get some boomer like 20-30% returns ? Hell no. She knows that gambling is coming to the United fucking States of America big time, and Donkey Kong is gonna ride that wave at the very front. After ARK's investment, it has already gone up 10%, and will keep on going up big time as other investors get in on it.    Sports betting is coming to US big time.    It is a well known fact that many states (especially Democratic ones) are considering sports betting as a way to raise tax money, since the Feds under the Trump government didn't give them shit for money all of last year. Hell, Cuomo was literally begging for some cash on television. Tons of state money got spent on battling the Coronavirus. Gambling is the easiest way to raise some cash that can be spent on fixing broken roads, schools, you name it.  This is a map of all the states where sports betting is legalized, or has legislation that seeks to legalize it.         Notice how   California    is grey ? What do you think is gonna happen when the tech bros in San Fran get their hands on mobile sports betting ? What do you think is gonna happen when the frat boys and sorority sluts in Los Angeles and San Diego are gonna get their hands on it ? They're gonna gamble on their favorite teams like it's Las fucking Vegas. Hell now that you've imagined that, imagine what would happen   when motherfucking Texas   legalizes sports betting. Do you even know how crazy those Texans are about sports ?   It should be noted that while   New York has legalized sports betting,   you can't bet using a mobile app right now, but Cuomo has been hinting about getting to that sometime soon. And that is gonna be massive.  Need I say more my fellow retards ?   Mark my words, 2021 is the year of sports betting.   It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when.    Hop on this rocket as it is fueling up and enjoy the ride.  As you were.  \                                                 -    My positions:    60 x DKNG 70$ 2/12 cause I'm a retard like that.  10 x DKNG 70$ Jan '22 cause I also like being a pussy sometime.  20 x DKNG 90$ Jan '23 cause I wanna retire in 2023.
Can anyone teach me to git gud at stonks
I've seen the tremendous amount of work that you all are putting in and I want in.   I want to learn how to play in the stock market, while being poor af.   Is there a way to start small and be safe? Or is this something I need to just jump headfirst into and hope I don't go any more broke than I already am?
LETS GO BOYS HOLDING THE GME TO MY GRAVE!
Keep me from being a loser like Jack
AMC GME movement Identical...
Has anyone noticed how similar AMC and GME following identical trends.
20k moar on BB. Where is the love?
Still holding the line. Doing what I can to stop the shorts covering at a cheap price. This is the way.
The change in mood from this morning is incredible.
The posts from this morning when it jumped to 85$ and so many more people fomoed in and now trading at sub 60 is fucking comedic gold. I don't understand why people were listening to accounts that have been posting here for less than 3 weeks when every account that's been here longer were telling you to get out or open puts.   Your greed has gotten you to where you are now. I hope you learn from this and go into the future with a better understanding of the world.   No, you're not sticking it to Melvin or the hedge funds. There are over 1,700 hedge funds with a billion+ in capital.  No, you're not the protagonist in some V for Vendetta fantasy. You stupid fucking neckbeards shit-chucking apes.  Yes it was over when Robinhood placed restrictions on retail.   No posting loss porn because you think you have diamond hands is not a badge of honor.
Wth happened to this place?
What’s with this politically correct “ape” bullshit, and since when did this place talk about politics?   Retard, autist, gay bear, please fuck my wife.. that’s WSB. Stop turning this place into a weird, ass puckering, politically correct, lamefest.
I'm new, but how I'm feeling after grabbing two GME's
Since Robinhood is garbage and also stupid ad dumb, where do you fine fellows recommend that we buy stock?
lmao
If you’re having a bad day, my ETF was cancelled by my bank with no notice and fidelity just sold my stocks to make up for it lol
- NEGATIVE BALANCE BOYS   (the ETF was placed on Monday and my bank cancelled, it was cash, not margin)
Halts are a part of regulation!
There’s been a fuck ton of complaints about halting, but understand halting stocks are necessary and part of regulation. Yes it sucks, it kills momentum and I know you’re angry but it is not just simply that the big guys are trying to fuck us over. Halts can happen for drastic increase AND decrease in prices. It’s just that GME prices don’t usually tank at a rate of them rising so it can seem like everything is against us. However, they happen to insure buy/sell orders line up and to spread news about the situation.  Stay calm and we’ll get through this!
At this point I’ve essentially bought $10,000 worth of memes and I fucking LOVE IT! I also LOVE THE STOCK! Y’all feeling like winners too? (Pic is just one account as I don’t trust any of them!)   🏼
NOK - is that normal? Open, high, low and close are exactly the same! WTF is going on?
Question
QUESTION WAS ANSWERED ! But leaving the post , just in case someone else is as dumb and new as I am to looking at charts lol.   _______________________________________________    Why is there sometimes up to $50 difference in different charts ? It makes me nervous to trade because what is the real price of stocks ?  Edit: I am looking at daily charts of one stock , clicking from different charts in real time (like apple, fidelity and so on) , I am not currently trading , just trying to learn the basics and the difference in charts is strange to me .   I apologize if I sound dumb, and maybe I’m in the wrong sub Reddit to ask such a basic question.

AMC and GME being weirdly symmetrical
Came here to cope...
Beware, the afternoon bots are in full force just like yesterday
Noticing the influx of fear mongering in posts/comments starting to follow the pattern of yesterday. Take everything you see with a grain of salt and ask yourself why people seem so salty about you buying/holding YOUR shares?
Some porn for you apes! I’m not selling!
Either way this GME goes, shares of $ROPE are going to go through the roof.
Containership Rate Boom Continues: ATCO & CMRE
Atlas Corp (ATCO) & Costamare (CMRE) & Peers    I shared my views on containership stocks earlier this week with a  . I listed the three largest cap names in the title since those are all over $1B and apparently anything under $1B = pump and dump. But AMC apparently wasn't?! Okay guys...  As I noted last week, rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) have been going ballistic the past 4-5 months, but some of the stocks have stalled out and still trade at remarkably cheap valuations. For instance Navios Containers trades in the neighborhood of 2x my expectations for their 2021 earnings.  Link to the latest containership rates:    The latest Harpex rates are posted each Friday morning. The new update that came out about 2 hours ago has them up another   for the midsize Panamax segment. This is a daily rate of $30,000 for the ships that hold 4,250 TEU (  the ship can carry 4,250 20-foot boxes or a little more than 2,000 40-foot boxes). Remember the trains? Those are usually 40' on top of another 40' per each car.  As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently long about every name possible in the sector. The names remain cheap. However, obviously if stocks keep surging, I will take profits in a responsible manner on the way up. "Dia hands" is a funny/cute meme, but it's really quite dumb for investors. Do your own due diligence, figure out what you believe something is worth, and don't get greedy!  The 13%+ increase in mid-sized container rates exemplifies the strength for a firm like Navios Containers (which owns 25 of these 'Panamax' ships!), but we should also look at Danaos Corp, which just announced a   for the whole company.  This is a massive turnaround from a company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy just a year ago. After the refinancing Danaos has a very streamlined balance sheet with no major maturities until 2028. Don't just take my view of it! Randy Giveans, analyst at Jefferies, and someone I can personally vouch for as a competent analyst with strong integrity,    just upgraded them to $    . I think he might even be too conservative on them...  I believe we're potentially just in the 4th or 5th inning of this run.    Bottom Line:   Bullish on containership names, really the entire sector. Sticking to names with market caps over $1B for the rules here- Atlas Corp (ATCO) and Costamare (CMRE).    Common Pushback:    1. Aren't these rates just in a massive bubble and will crash soon:  The rates appear to be quite strong compared to the past 10 years, but if you look at a 20-year average and the strength of the 2000s, you'll see they aren't that far out of line. The past decade, and 2013-2018 in particular, was a horrible time for container ships. These are cyclical stocks sort of like automakers or airlines or mining. Furthermore, the rates we quote and discuss are rates for 1-year and oftentimes 2-3 year deals are being signed at similar levels of strength. These aren't just 1-2 month type 'spot' rates.  2) Is this like "tankers" I got burned there and I believe shipping sucks:  Tankers were earning literal all-time record highs last Spring, but these were just for 30-80 day voyages. Unlike containers, the rates were record highs, no prior precedent for long-term duration. Also, unlike containers, the duration was 30-80 days, not 1-3 years. Finally, unlike containers, the tanker rates were driven by a very short-term arbitrage due to collapsing oil prices. Containers were already strong in late-2019 on a major cyclical upswing before temporarily being interrupted by COVID.  3) Isn't all this rate strength only due to COVID-19 and will go away soon:  Containerships were already in a massive upturn during 2019 and into the very start of 2020. Then COVID interrupted all this and rates briefly collapsed. Yes, port delays and other issues from COVID are helping keep rates higher, but this isn't just a temporary dislocation like tankers, the rates were already strong without COVID.  4) Shipping is a horrible sector and nobody can every make money in it!  I hear this a lot. It's just not true if you have access to good research and are nimble with your positions. I've beaten the industry average for 6 of 6 years (2015-2021 YTD) and I've beaten the Russell 2000 for 5 of 6 years (all except for 2020 where underperformed). It is important to watch out for governance. DryShips was one example of a horribly managed firm.  5) Won't liners just order more ships and destroy this amazing market:  The average delivery window for new ships ordered today is between mid-2023 and mid-2024. They can order them sure, and some have been, but this won't make much of any impact on current rates/balance. The shipping world erroneously believed that midsize tonnage was obsolete (  either go huge for big scale or go really small for niche coastal trades), but that turned out to be completely wrong. Therefore there were almost zero midsized ships ordered between 2012-2020 and the fleet is fairly middleaged to older on average. Fleet growth might even be negative in some areas.     Disclosure:    I’m long nearly every name in the space- Atlas Corp, Capital Partners, Danaos Corp, MPC Containers (on the Oslo exchange), Navios Containers, Navios Partners, and Zim Integrated. I have a medium-term to longer-term constructive view on this space, but I do take profits to rationalize my portfolio when things surge. "Diamond hands" is a dumb meme. If there's a lot of volatility, I might be a seller or switch positions (for example, I sold CMRE earlier this morning and rolled it into ZIM).  I have about 10% of my wealth in the Navios names. Average basis in Navios Containers is in the lower-$1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. I previously sold 20% on 4 January at $  and I sold 20% on 14 January at $  I will probably sell another 15-20% in the $7s. I disclose all of my positions and trades in real-time (or as real-time as possible) on my research platform.     Nothing in this post constitutes investment advice in ANY fashion.    I'm just a guy sharing my positions and research and talking about what I like and what I own. Don't be dumb.
My E Trade @ average $201 buy. RH @ $66. SoFi $96. About 250 total. HOLD THE LINE FOOLS! But seriously. Sell when you must!
Numbers of GameStop shares shorted dips further -- S3 Partners
We are going to grassroots lobby our representatives with our own proposed legislation to help retail investors more freely trade. Can we get a proposed list of what we want to have in the bill in the comment section below?
Background: I have seen many posts from good activist apes on here who are calling and writing their legislators to inform them of what is going on. In large part,  their response is the same: "we will keep you in mind when legislation is proposed". You better believe that corporate and hedge fund lobbyists are already working on their proposed language. It's time we work on ours.  Let's get specific with what new legislation we want to be implemented on behalf of retail traders, calling for more transparency and freedom in the market.  We can organize a grassroots lobbying   of our own, for a proposed bill of our own design to be put through Congress, which will set down laws that actually protect and expand the rights of retail traders, and provide more transparency, prevent the purposeful counterfeiting of shares by bad actors, and create new limits on short selling (for example, shorting more than 100% of a stock)  If we leave this up to the system, the bill that is finally voted on may weak, or at worst may even be loaded against us. If we can get the lawyers of the subreddit together to help write the proposed language of the bill, we can do a grassroots   of lobbying all our representatives to vote for our bill.  Edit: a lot of good comments are coming from people who are under the threshold for commenting, and their comments are getting removed. Feel free to message me with your ideas, because I can see from my push notifications that there are some good ideas being deleted.

Is ZOM being discussed? Haven’t seen much? What’s the play?  GME and AMC are over boys.
Just found out I’m not even allowed to sell $AMC, only buy more    😎
My loss porn y’all. Got my first two babies at 424 like a big hairy ape. Thank you retards for giving me an opportunity to stick it to the man! Diamond hands!!11!!
It ain’t much, but if you think I won’t double down when my wife’s boytoy gives me my allowance you’re dead wrong.
GME Bagholders are literal idiots and dumb dumbs
If you were smart, you would have taken advantage of the momentum and sold at $80 to recover some of your losses.  But no.   As soon as they saw the price start increasing, all these dumbasses forgot about the depression they were in and started saying the same shit like "hOdL, aPeS sTrOnK tOgEtHeR 1!1!11!! oMg?!!? Short squeoze about to happen"   Take this L:    L   Y'all deserve it. Might as well invest in $ROPE next. Delusional dumb fucks.

New Retard who is HOLDING!
I did it!!  I knew nothing about any of this but have been learning for the last 2 weeks.  I am now a proud ape with 1 @ $  of $GME stonk!!!!  I am in it to lose it!!    I lost everything in 2008 as a realtor in Florida.  My job, my house, my car, all of it.  Job market was a black hole and I had to work 3 jobs as a single Mom to live and support my family.  It was exhausting. Broke me physically, mentally and spiritually to this day.  It was a rough, scary and stressful time that I don’t wish on anyone.  I went to bed hungry so my daughter could eat but she never knew it, thank God.   This is my very little contribution to those elitist who think I’m nobody.  I am someone. I might be a retarded ape who loves bananas but I own a piece of history now and I’m NOT letting go. You see, I’ve been at my lowest, I know how to survive on nothing, I damn sure know you hedge fund mofo’s wouldn’t know the first thing about surviving on ramen noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner.  Only water to drink, from the tap too.  Yeah, this is for those times when I had to gag down another packet of chicken flavored ramen because rent was due and I couldn’t afford a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.  So don’t think I can’t survive. Honey I put the “S” in survivor and I know how to make a mean bowl of ramen.  So bring it.   I can hold to infinity. Can you?
GME Partial Shares now available on Robinhood
If you’re like me and couldn’t afford a full share before, Robinhood is now allowing partial shares on Robinhood. Don’t give up! Let’s take this to the moon!    🌔
The porn site BangBros has produced a porno spoofing a dumb investor making millions because of his "diamond hands" and his, err, "diamond member".

WHERE THE FUCK IS BILL ACKMAN (MARIO JUDAH VOICE)
What are you buying in PSTH?  TLDR AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE ILLITERATES    This is the biggest SPAC of all time  . If you follow this ticker you know that this is a SPAC merger led by famed investor Bill Ackman. I’m not going to explain what a SPAC is,  learn to use google dumbass . The company is yet to be announced but is rumored to be announced sometime in Q1 of 2021. Some companies that have been rumored have been Stripe (plz god),    Bloomberg   , Fidelity, Chick-fil-a, Subway (lmao), WeWork, SpaceX (no lol), WaWa, and many many more. Make no mistake, you are investing in Bill Ackman’s ability to find a mature unicorn and once the announcement is made, that is the company that you are invested in. Keep in my mind, when acquisition is announced that company will get a 5 billion injection of cash, so going forward it makes for a healthy company.  So who the fuck is Bill Ackman?  You may hate the guy or love him, but you can’t deny that this dude is sharp as a fucking tack and knows his shit. He also gets to fuck on   Neri Oxmen  ,  so that’s tight . I’d say his notoriety comes from a few different events so let’s do a quick recap.  1. Calling the 2020 crash: You can say his doom and gloom prediction before the Covid crash was an orchestrated event, but either way he was fucking right and that matters. Obviously, I don’t need to tell you what has happened since then, I haven’t been to a bar in like a fucking year.    But this was one if the biggest trades in history turning 27 million in   billion by using credit protection on investment grade and high yield bond indexes.    2. The Herbalife short: You can watch “Betting on Zero” if you don’t know about this, but he shorted Herbalife and exposed them for their    predatory practices and MLM scheme   . Here he was “right” but still lost the trade (so wrong). Had he never announced his position in this, he may have   hit a lick here  , but you must foresee adaptation and adjustment, so he took an L. Did Icahn fuck him here? Yeah, but you have to admire the research and the balls he had for this call. 3. Valeant airball: a huge shitshow in which Valeant was boosting drug prices and doing shady stuff. He lost 4 billion on this. Obviously not a great look and  he has to eat the full L here .  A mixed bag when it comes to his reputation, but I believe he does his research well and that combined with his business acumen is why I have a heavy (personally) position in PSTH.  So how will this play out?  I’m not gunna go over every rumor in depth, but I’ll cover some that I like and some that I don’t.  Stripe: This is the one that every PSTH investor is up late  at night touching themselves to . If it’s stripe this will explode and could easily hit   100   within the year (maybe even day). I personally don’t think it will be Stripe, in an interview about 6 months ago he said they weren’t ready to go public. Maybe by the time he announces they will be? Some people are saying that there is no chance of a Fintech merger, he hasn’t said anything that would make me believe that. Does he have experience in that industry? No,   but that doesn’t disqualify it.    Bloomberg:   My personal prediction   and my 3rd choice if I had to pick one of the rumored companies. Ackman likes to dip his toes into political commentary and philanthropy, both of which Michael Bloomberg also does. I just think this is a good fit all around, he said he loves Bloomberg and has had an active subscription since the 90’s.  SpaceX: This is pure speculation; this would go absolutely parabolic. I don’t even know the heights that this stock could reach if this was to happen.  Fidelity: I’m not sure where some of these rumors originate from, but I think it’s because they are eyeing an IPO soon. I personally use Fidelity so I like this, it’s app could use an injection of youth and 5 billion could  definitely do it.  Pair this with the recent influx of people who are going to be leaving platforms like RH and other apps using the APEX clearing house and you have yourself a    possible homerun   .  Chik-fil-a: The lords chicken. Any food chain mentioned is a possibility due to Ackman’s background in food chains. CF is a good company, but there is a lot of hype surrounding this SPAC, I’m not sure this would be a catalyst for a big move.  Subway: People laugh at this one, but it is the    largest food chain in the      That makes this play a little better but  still kind of disappointing  IMO.  WaWa: I don’t know enough about this company, I know it has a near cult like following so that’s a positive, but again, the biggest SPAC ever ends up being a WaWa? wack.  PornHub and Onlyfans: LMAAOO. No fucking way, but would it make money?   Instant meme stock makes for a massive pump.    Wework: I don’t know enough about this company to have a strong opinion, but I’ve heard positive rumblings about it. This would be wildcard, I’m not sure how the market would react.  So how to play this? I don’t fucking know I’m not a financial advisor. I’m looking for Billy SPACman to take me to tendie town. Personally, I think he will make a great choice, so I’ve been building a LEAPs position for months now. I also own shares, for the warrants. It’s also crazy that we haven’t heard a   single reputable rumor and it has been MONTHS   now since the SPAC was announced.  TLDR; Let Billy SPACman take you to the moon on his STRIPed Spacex rocket ship from your Fidelity app. Lots of rumors here, you’re investing in the individual.  Edit for                  Also if it isn't SpaceX, Bloomberg, Fidelity, maybe Wework, i'm not sure I'd hold long term.
Rest
Right everyone, this will be my last talk on GME till next week, I am absolutely burnt out, but a public forum seems the perfect place to vent. It's been an incredibly rough time for all of us so here goes.  Some of you have lost insane amounts of money, some of you a little more modest (me for example, 2 @$250), and some of you real diamond hands got in a lot less! Regardless, money is money and nobody wants to lose it. Use this weekend to chill out, relax play ball in the park (lol) or simply use those giant ape hands to play video games like I know you all secretly do.  It's important that we all realise this fight only goes on as long as we decide to let it, but that there is a reason we hold. There's a reason that people are STILL holding.  Ultimately, people will do as they always have, and do what they want. There will be the selfless and the selfish, and we can never avoid it. However we can quite loudly show that we care that this is not how things should be. Next week, people should push as hard as possible, but who knows if they will. You guys really are amazing, and you would never expect so many people to agree on one thing so strongly. It's incredibly inspiring.  I have next to no financial knowledge, and this is absolutely not any kind of advice. This weekend is going to be a rest period for us all, and you should use it well.
What the   is the green?
Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal
“Seems more likely that android auto or whatever apple comes up with takes over as they are more familiar to consumers and have already proven wildly successful”    This is a comment I got on one of the Blackberry DD posts, It made me decide to read more and stop being emotional in how I support the company's progress. I decided to analyze all bear cases I receive Blackberry.     "Millions of Ford vehicles will run Google's Android operating system starting in 2023"  This the Ford and Google press release title from CNN.  First of all, very bold for Ford to assume they are going to be selling millions of cars in 2023. Their top seller is the F150 is going to banned from sales in most of the developed world during this decade. This is a different argument for later, my argument here is how the press release was made.  This press release is kind of desperate. If your sales estimate is the first part of your statement and not the new technology you are announcing, then this is a stock pumping press release.  On the contrary, Here is the Blackberry announcement 3 months ago announcing that they signed a deal with Ford that paved the way to integrate Android into the system.     It’s a very technical press release. It’s very professional, what you expect to see from an engineering company announcing a deal. They didn’t say “Billions to be generated from a new deal with Ford”.    With no pumping, What is the Ford and Android deal exactly?    That means future Fords will feature Sync systems that use Google Maps and Android's excellent voice recognition, as well as opening up the platform to third-party developers. Ford will also use Google Cloud for its connected services, and the two companies will collaborate "to create new experiences for customers."  This is basically replacing the Sync 3 plus app. Android has an app already to sync your phone with the car. It’s like Chromecast for the car. The new announcement is basically saying that the sync3 app is going to be built-in inside the car. You can use it to open maps and have your other apps on and use an android voice assistant. Which exactly what  The car is still going to use QNX. Android can’t control car electronics. It’s a very sophisticated real-time processing of sensor data.  QNX controls the electronics of the F35 fighter jets. QNX was on the livery of Petronas Mercedes F1 car. Can you imagine how sophisticated it is to control the electronics of the fastest piece of machinery on earth? You can literally change the engine map while driving on 350 km/hour.  The good thing is that Blackberry responded. The company is paying attention to the people and keeps on assuring them. Blackberry posts regularly now on Twitter. They respond in a subtle way to the arguments. They probably upgraded their contract with the agency handling their social media affairs. They probably scan Reddit for them and the Blackberry PR team is aware of the conversations around the company.

HOOOOOLLLDDD
Haven't seen this mentioned here very much. Did you know that if you hold 100 shares of GME you can sell covered calls and it's guaranteed risk free money?
By 'guaranteed risk free' I'm under the assumption that you plan on holding the 100 shares anyway no matter what.  \- Suppose you buy 100 shares of GME right now at $63 per share  \- Then you sell a 2/12/21 $150 covered call, using those shares as collateral, for $720 (Could have sold for a lot more earlier today)  \- You now have $720, no matter what happens. This is your money now, you can do whatever you want with it.  \- Your WORST CASE scenario (assuming you want to keep the shares) is that on market close on 2/12, GME closes over $150. The call you sold will get assigned, and you will be forced to SELL your shares at $150. So you will receive $15,000 for your 100 shares.  \- Math: $15k + $720 - $6300 = $9420 net profit  Even before GME started, more than half of WSB thought if a covered call you sold was assigned, you just lost the shares and didn't get any money for them at all, so if you still don't understand this that's okay.  Think of it this way. If you sell a call for more than the price you paid for the stock (EG - buy at $63 per share, sell a $65 call) YOU CANNOT LOSE ANY MONEY. IT IS LITERALLY A GUARANTEED GAIN! This doesn't factor in commissions, but if you are on a broker charging commissions then this isn't for you.  If you decide to do this, and afterwards GME skyrockets, you'll yourself down potentially over 1000% on the call you sold. Don't worry about it, just don't buy it back.
Why isn't the rocket flying?
I bought 5 GME @ $250 and bought again earlier 10 GME @ $71 but it keeps dipping again.  everyone said we'd be flying, what's going on.????

Can I instruct my broker to recall my shares and to stop lending them to short sellers?
And if so, how is this done?  I think that if we all recalled our shares, $GME would go back up, as the shorts wouldn’t  have a lot of shares to borrow for cheap.

GameStop Shares Up After Robinhood Lifts Buying Restrictions
I put all my money into GameStop.
"I heard about GME and that it was a good stock to have if you want to become rich quick. So I sold my car, pooled all of my savings and bought GME shares with all the money I own.  Needless to say I got fucked big time. Bought in at 260+. I have no knowledge about how the whole trading thing works and now I've lost everything. Won't be able to pay my mortgage and will soon be homeless."  Does this sound familiar to you? I bet it does. Because since this whole thing started I've been reading posts like this all over every platform.  How fucking dumb can you be? I mean, tough luck but then again, why would anyone gamble all their life savings away like that?  I know, the whole "get rich quick" thing is eating away peoples brains, but that's just another level of stupid.  Only invest what you are willing to lose. That's the only rule you should follow. One rule. And people are failing. What a mess.  Edit. : for the people who don't get it - I did not do this. I am not that dumb. Hundreds of people did thou and that's the point.
I see big discrepancies between GME on mobile and on desktop
Specifically lows, highs, and current prices of option contracts.  Like in the 100s, can someone else also do some of these comparisons for verification?  Edit: On Robinhood\

An In Depth Look Into Aphria (  And Why This Stock Should Be A 4x Bagger At Least
\ \ \  This is a slightly edited verison of my post in  r/stocks\ . I tried posting the DD here before but it got removed by Auto-mod and I got temporarily banned. \ \ \ \        The play  : Long stocks and ATM leap calls  Summary: Aphria is trading at a hefty discount when comparing price multiples to its largest viable competitor Canopy Growth Corp (  As of the release of the company’s recent Q2 2021 financial statement, Aphria now has more revenue and a much lower net loss than Canopy Growth; however, despite all that, Canopy still has a market cap that is 4 times larger than Aphria. This I believe is a major pricing inefficiency created by the market because both companies are showing significant growth in their revenue while capturing additional market share in a growing industry while only Aphria has shown investors that is the only dominant marijuana company that can cut down costs and increase profit margins. Because of this, the premium in Canopy’s market cap is not justifiable and Aphria should be valued at least as much or even more than Canopy Growth.       Industry Background Info    Ever since the Canadian government legalized the recreational use of marijuana in 2018, Canadian weed companies have risen to become the dominant players on the global stage. As of right now, the four largest weed companies by market cap are Canopy Growth ( , Cronos ( , Aphria ( , and Aurora (   Of this grouping, only Aphria has consistently shown investors that it can grow its business from both the top and bottom lines all the while making mergers and acquisitions that will allow it to capitalize on the growing recreational market in the   Here let me show you why Aphria has the strongest fundamentals.        If you pull up Canopy’s recent quarterly report and look at their income statement, you will find that even though cost of goods sold (COGS) has a slightly decreased ratio to revenue from 76% for the first 3 quarters in 2019 (145,162 / 189,012) to 78% in 2020 (213,107 / 269,916), its total operating expenses excluding COGS, is still   LARGER   than its revenue (operating expenses are 489,216 for 2021). What’s more is that over half of this comes from SGA (Selling, General, and Admin). What this shows is that even though the company is growing, it is not becoming more efficient, rather it is becoming more inefficient.     As for the other two companies Cronos and Aurora, their fundamentals are even more atrocious than Canopy’s. Cronos has revenue roughly 29million for first three quarters of 2020 which is peanuts compared to Aphria and Canopy. What’s more is that the company is showing earnings that are HIGHER than their total revenue. I suspect this is a result of their revaluation of their marijuana inventory which is complete bullshit because it assumes company can sell it all at the current fair market price and no auditor can accurately assess the true value of a living and growing agricultural product (trust me my background is in accounting). Why this company is worth over 5bil is beyond me. Aurora is similar with tiny amounts of revenue while operating at massive losses. The company didn’t even sell anything in 20q2 so I’m not going to go into great depth with either of them.     Tl;Dr:     The only viable competitor with Aphria is Canopy and right now Canopy is making less money than Aphria both in the top and bottom lines. The other two companies are essentially the weird kid in the class sitting in a corner eating chalk. Bless their hearts.        Aphria Fundamentals    Alright let’s get to the good stuff. Here is a pic of part of their income statement for you to follow:           Right now, COGS ratio for Aphria is comparable with Canopy. By Nov 2020, ratio is 71% (219,136 / 306,221) and 74% (188,670 / 246,712) in 2019. But if you go down the statement you will find out that in the breakdown of their operating expenses, the company actually manages to keep expenses relatively stable as revenue grows. The only line that really stands out for me is the transaction cost expense of   which relates to business acquisitions. I think most of the   is related to their Tilray acquisition that I will discuss later on. Other than that, the company manages to stabilize its expenses and its total operating cost is far less than their revenue, which is something Canopy cannot say.        Tl;dr:     Aphria is a lean machine while Canopy is like a toddler that took one too many steroids and suddenly grew to the size of a NFL linebacker all the while having an IQ of 4. What this means is that Canopy’s growth is by no means sustainable and the only way for the company to continue operations is if it manages to grow revenue fast enough it outpaces expenses, but right now that is not the case.      T  ilray Merger Implications    Recently in 2020 Aphria announced an all-stock merger that will be carried out by a reverse stock split   (meaning Aphria will exchange   APHA shares per TLRY share  ). After the merger is finalized, Aphria will control 63% of Tilray. One of the key advantages of the reverse split is that it decreases the amount of total shares outstanding, making the shares more valuable.  This is something I feel like retail investors need to look at more closely. The reason why is that the merger will give Aphria a strategic advantage of breaking into the US and EU markets.     On a final point, the merger with Tilray will also let Aphria directly compete with Canopy Growth Corp in the marijuana beverage industry.  . This agreement has allowed Tilray to launch their own drinks in late 2019, thus allowing them to be competitive with Canopy in the drinks market as well.  The advantage comes from the fact that even though Tilray is headquartered in Canada, it is registered as a US firm. What’s more is that Tilray also has agreements with EU countries that allow it to expand its position in the EU cannabis market. Tilray has announced it has been selected by the French national Agency for the Safety of medicines and Health Products to supply Good Manufacturing Processes certified medical cannabis products in France. In addition, the company also has agreements with other EU nations like Portugal that you can examine at your own free time.     Tl;Dr    : Aphria buy Tilray. Tilray in   and deal with   This let Aphria go to   and   This let Aphria bring in big mooneee.          Marijuana Legalization    The Democrats taking control of the White House, Senate, and Congress is the equivalent of the second coming of Christ for the marijuana industry, and no this is not an understatement. Right now, marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational uses in 15 states but is still illegal on the federal level. What this means is that companies need to wait for states to legalize individually and even when they do so, there are still significant red tapes abound that will greatly hinder industry growth. One of the most prevalent examples of red tape is the fact that marijuana dispensaries do not have access to proper banking so they operate exclusively as a cash-based business. This is because if a bank provides services to a weed dispensary, it can be charged on the federal level for money laundering.  That is all about to change because the Dems in the Senate announced that one of their main goals with their majority is to end the federal criminalization of marijuana use. In addition, Chuck Schumer already announced that a draft of the bill will be introduced in the first half of 2021.     What’s more is that when weed is legalized on the federal level, it is actually legalized on the state level as well. This is because of something called the Supremacy Clause in the constitution that established that federal law controls when state and federal law are in conflict.   “but  u/gushingranny1\ , if that’s the case, how come I can smoke pot in California huuuuh?”\   Well listen here you little turd, granny going to explain to ya.  You see the constitution, though the Tenth Amendment delegates police powers to the states. This means that even though states cannot prevent federal prosecution of their citizens, they can still eliminate state prosecutions.          Tl;Dr  : Once weed is legalized on federal level, floodgates will open. You think marijuana stocks got crazy in 2017? Just wait for this one.      \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Positions: 1495 shares @ $14 and 2 $9 July Calls

What Wallstreet Bets has become
For better or worse it to be determined, however it cannot be denied: Wallstreet Bets has become host to a social movement. As you can see between the divide of amateurs, OG’s, paper dicks, and diamond balls, this social movement is not necessarily defined by any one resolution. Within every social movement there are sub communities with their own goals and ideas, but what ties all these subdivisions together is a strive for advancement and a common home for identity. Take a moment, sit back, and really take in what has been accomplished here.   Whether you have been here years, or weeks, retarded or just slightly autistic you are apart of a beautiful moment of history. As I see it, our common cause is obtaining equity. Regardless of your opinions of the players of Wallstreet or wealth in general, everyone here have been trying to create equity for themselves in a broader society that favors the institution over the individual. This is the American free market. This is the evolution of democracy. This is the attempt to democratize Wallstreet.   “Apes strong together” is the war cry of any union around the world. When the first squeeze occurred, RobinHood answered by restricting buying and preventing any more price increase. WallStreet has shown time and time again they can change the rules when they lose. The legacy of the Diamond Hands Union is their attempt to reassert the retail investor as a player into a game not made for them. This union did affect the price. You saw that today. The trading restrictions were lifted and more diamond hands bought. The stock value increases. The demand went up and therefore the value goes up.   This is what Mark Cuban was talking about. He never said it was a good idea to buy, but by buying the Diamond Hands Union can be a test of the power this union has. I would say forcing a stock up over $20 in 20 minutes is a lot of power. This is not about GME. I like the stock too. I like how GameStop actually seized this moment to expand their business options. But it about fighting for change in a rigged system. I am holding because people did not die for this country so I could live off my wife’s boyfriend’s Merrill Lynch salary. It was to keep the fight alive. So even if we are doomed for failure, I will continue to hold to keep that fight alive so my son can one day lose all of his life savings on a Wallstreet bet because of his own stupidity and not because some mosquito prick like RobinHood changed the game.  TL;DR: This is not financial advice. Obviously. I just learned how to write yesterday. Better git gud at sucking your wife’s boyfriend’s cock when you lose all your life savings.  Edit: Some helpful Einstein ape taught me about paragraphs and emojis. Always learning, always holding.  ✊🍆

It's so strange to me that people will FOMO in at $350 but won't mitigate their risk and resist buying a falling knife at $50-60.
Like think about it, what's more likely, it goes to $10 and you lose most your money, or a dying meme stock goes to $400?  Even Warren Buffett himself once said "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful." But Warren Buffet actually knows what he is fucking doing, retards.  Think about how when you and the other autist apes were FOMOing in at $300+ and how much fucking money you have lost. Wish you got in lower? Now may be your   move on. (Or not, lol). You can always lose more money.

Guys. The funds know were still holding even tho most of us have lost MASSIVELY on paper. They’re gonna continue doing this kinda stuff until  1. We sell. But like why would we sell I lost over 70% and idc.  2. They need to buy back.  3. Funds get in on this action and bankrupt each other and cause a war on wallstreet...    If the short float remains strong. They literally will chew each other alive and we will profit on the back end.  HOLD STRONG. UNLESS U ABSOLUTELY NEED THE MONEY RN. JUST HOLD. ITS ONLY BEEN 2 weeks. THEY NEED US TO LOSE HOPE. TO LOSE INTEREST. BUT THIS TAKES PATIENCE
What about averaging this cost down ? Gamestonnnnnnkkkkkkk better not let me behind 🥳💯🤣
Let’s do it like Apollo 1!
I know, I know. You idiots don't like any any frivolous nonsense on this upstanding sub!
But seriously, the last couple weeks is the most fun I have had on some stupid forum full of  's and  🤲's in pretty much forever. Which isn't saying much.  Respect to all those that made some 💰.  More respect to those that lost 💸!  Regroup and enjoy the 🏈 this weekend, or whatever it is you do. ✌️
The technical term for one of the tactics used lately is, “bear raid”.
In the same vein as making your voice heard by voting, make your voice heard by contacting your local representative to encourage them to push for investigating this matter.  One of the tactics used lately is what’s called a “bear raid”. Definitions from Wikipedia and Investopedia, respectively:  From Wikipedia:  > A bear raid is a type of stock market strategy, where a trader (or group of traders) attempts to force down the price of a stock to cover a short position. The name is derived from the common use of bear or bearish in the language of market sentiment to reflect the idea that investors expect downward price movement.[1] > > A bear raid can be done by spreading negative rumors about the target firm,[2] which puts downward pressure on the share price. This is typically considered a form of securities fraud. Alternatively, traders could take on large short positions themselves, manipulating the price with the large volume of selling,[3] making the strategy self-perpetuating.  And from Investopedia:  > A bear raid is an illegal practice of ganging up to push a stock's price lower through concerted short selling and spreading adverse rumors about the targeted company. A bear raid is sometimes resorted to by unscrupulous short sellers who want to make a quick buck from their short positions. > > A bear-raid target is generally a company that is going through a challenging period, since its vulnerable position makes it easy fodder for short sellers. While short selling is legal, coordinated short selling is viewed as market manipulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and spreading false rumors is tantamount to fraudulent activity.  I think it’s important that we use precise terminology when calling for action. The blatant smear   in the media (especially CNBC) to sow doubt and sway public opinion, as well as the manufactured story of “squeezing” silver for the purposes of misdirection cannot go unnoticed. We must call out this bad behavior. Let’s do this!
The Hedgies are gonna go after his employer too! God Speed DFV!
If I see “to the moon    ” one more time, I’m going to strangle somebody with my   .
Hedgies are still losing big if this is the new floor, right!?
Total noob here but fully committed. I’m wondering if holding at this price around $60 is still the same effect as the $100/200+? I’m holding either way, will just feel better knowing it’s still effective to be doing so.
Proud Retard
I was so so so close to putting in a stop order and counting my losses at $50!   But I am so glad I cancelled it before market open. We fought back against the 1% today. We kept GME alive.   Keep holding Apes.  Diamond hands will make it to the moon! Let's squeeze these hedgie fuckers.   This is not financial advice, retard.
Honest question, is AMC a deviation from GME or a SECOND rocket?
I'm not saying the sudden AMC posting isn't wrong, hell I encourage it though I have 2 GME that I bought at $200. What's making super confused is why people think they're the NEXT $GME when they've BOTH been following the EXACT SAME trends, the graphs look practically identical.   What's the motivation other than the FOMO?
Thoughts on the future of GameStop? Any possible future investments? Tips for investing?
I am down in the dumps about GME. Honestly, it was my choice to do what I did. I still have hope and I am still holding.  Besides that, I’m planning on investing in PLUG when I have enough to invest again. I am also still kind of new to investing and I would love to learn more.  Anyone have any tips about investing? Long term or short term? I don’t want to randomly toss money wherever anymore. I became too cocky to quickly. I’d love to hear any suggestions for investing!

Can someone help with this chart & my analysis? (GME)
-Does the red circle signify when gamma squeeze was supposed to start and then dip after that is when they restricted buying and killed the initial “meme” momentum?  - And what if the two spikes in the green circle are hedge funds dumping the first half of the short positions in two quick but slightly separate dumps, and then other hedgies that knew the play exiting on those highs after buying in on the low points while retail buyers were blocked which started the price drop?  If there were only   short positions exited this week:    - 2/5:   shorted    - 2/1:   shorted, down 35m from the start of them exiting their short positions.  (And this is S3 data who people aren’t really trusting as the official short report for 1/31 isn’t even out yet)  Then is there a chance they only exited just a part of their positions and another squeeze could happen?  I dunno this is all me just daydreaming and thinking aloud to myself, I’m not a financial advisor and I’m not suggesting anyone trade with my advice. I also don’t really think any of the short numbers out right now are accurate, or how much of the short positions reported are new positions set at 500, but I just needed to word vomit    EDIT: Guys I can’t see any comments besides the automod comment, can people PM me answers instead?  EDIT 2: So nobody can explain the short interest number in those articles/tweets?
We never should’ve been using Robinhood in the first place
Now that I’m a week into trading and I’m thoroughly convinced I’ll be the next Warren Buffet, I’ve developed a strategy for swing trading that I’m pretty confident will produce a good amount of income. My strategy relies on triggering stop loss and limit orders, but low and behold I find Robinhood is severely lacking in this department. You can’t place OCO orders(once cancels the other; two simultaneous orders on one stock to both limit loss and set your exit point).   ThinkorSwim by Ameritrade on the other hand not only allows these types of orders, but I’m reading that they even allow bracket orders, which basically will automate my strategy removing the need for calculating percentages with every damn stock I buy.   TLDR: Robinhood sucks ass in a multitude of ways and we should all be using different brokerage services

Personally down about 2500$.... Don't sell though. You only lose money when u sell... Hold hold hold!!!   ️  To fucking mars babyyy
GME: 318 shares and blew $50,000 of my savings on it. Holding till the end!! FUCK IT!
Why patience matters (particularly with companies that you believe in).

When will we know the actual short interest next week and what affect will that have on the stock?
I know that a lot of people are talking about how the currently projected short interest is almost impossibly smaller than it was previously reported a day earlier. I know that most are speculating that the reason the projected short interest is down is due to synthetic longs.   At what point next week will we find out if that’s the case and what affect will this have on GME?
Not gonna lie. Hedge funds are shutting in their pants. Cuz we’re just not fucking selling the way they want. Even at the stock price rn they CANT afford to buy back every share. WE ARE STRONG AFFF
While I was eating my crayons and feces I dropped some on my GME chart. For those who don’t speak crayon we broke out of a falling wedge (super good ) we have a rounded bottom (super good  ) and MACD and RSI bullish divergences (super good ) Pessimists eat our ape shit!
They think I’m trolling them when I asked if they were unethical and pushing dangerous false, narratives

Enough! You're a bag holder now

Give Me My Loss Porn
Everyone wants to say that you’re not part of the real r/wsb when it suits them, but no one will do the most r/wsb thing of all and post their loss porn.   And I’m talking everyone. Obviously a ton of people lost money on their $GME shares, but I know a ton of you lost money on your $60 GME puts today, too.   I am hungry. I want my loss porn. Give it to me.
Gentleman listen up
It's been a long war , a tough war , today we may not have acheived total victory, but we did finish the day positive. A step in the right direction.

Don't drink and drive  Don't end up in jail.  If you do end up in jail, establish domanice quickly.   Its been a privlage.
Where do you guys do your taxes?
I’m sure I’m not the only one with hundreds of trades, including options, option spreads, and wash sales that aren’t really wash sales (lowering the cost basis and then exiting the stock altogether later).  It’s complicated shit, and this year is the first year where I have substantial sales that look like wash sales but really shouldn’t be penalizing. Do you guys go to a CPA or do you just do taxes yourself through Turbotax / Credit Karma?

An interesting Theory surrounding GameStop
This is wild theory but hear me out on this one. For every single share of gamestop that was bought at $200-$300, a share was being sold for $200-$300 by a young bull thats fucking your mom and cucking your dad 🤦‍♂️🖕 enjoy your losses retards. Someone sold you a dream and you thought you were a part of something bigger. Welcome to wallstreetbets. For every winner you now have 100 losers. Remind me on Monday when gamestop is at 300 again

SLV cash covered call writing
I want to write cash covered weekly calls on SLV that are 10% OTM. If done at close today, a call for 2/12 at a strike of $  could have been sold. I would place a limit buy at $  to protect myself from downside should the underlying increase and I get exercised. I would have netted $14 in premium and would need $2750 to cover myself. It looks like over the past year this would have worked for roughly 48 weeks, annualized the return would be about 24%. If it gaps up AH when it is near the strike I could lose a percent or two but it should be negligible. If it reaches my limit buy and dropped back down before I could close my position and sell I also face minimal risk. Do you see any flaws that I am missing?   Of course since 24% isnt going to be enough to purchase a yacht with a helicopter big enough to transport my lambo I will require leverage but I havent nailed down any flaws in my merchant cash advance ponzi scheme yet so dont downvote for my sub 1000% returns, they will come

How we feeling about $PENN
What’s your opinion on PENN. wondering if it’s too late to get into it or you think this as a long term investment that’ll kick off when sports betting goes national?   Coming from a    who’s still holding GME at 270 and AMC at 16  😭
Got an email from Robinhood. They're getting desperate...
NOK NOK, WHO’S DOWN?
It’s a BANG stock party 🕺🏼💃🏼 who’s still in?
Definitely an interesting week but we saw a strong finish. If your smooth brain is still in on this PARTY how do you feel moving into next week?
Kevin O'Leary talks about Robinhood and Wallstreetbets. He thinks RH is here to stay. I think   WSB users have something else to say about that.
I'm still holding! Hope we all followed Cuban's advise and ditched RH.

CRSR Yolo
I've been GME gang for so long, it feels weird to hold anything else. CRSR is going to     during earnings next week.
In case anyone hasn’t seen yet, S3 made a mistake by not locking their comment thread on one of their promoted posts, go wild.
EDIT: they deleted their video but the comments are still commentable, I love you all you autistic fucks.  Second EDIT: Fuck S3  Third EDIT: Old comments have been hidden or removed I think? But new comments are showing. Oh and fuck S3.
We need to hold when the price go up
When the price go up and the majority of us will break even DON’T SELL . I know a lot of paper hands will taps out and just want to exit . But people please , for sake of everyone who is in this thing hole as long as you can to tigger a huge squeeze      We have each other backs guys because apes together are strong 🦧
52 Week High is going to be this Tuesday, Feb the 9th! Im making the call.
I know there has been a lot of negative going around on GME on both sides. I don't think this is over at all. Based on everything I have seen and everything I have been hearing the bubble is about to burst and the 52 Week High is going to hit next week on Tuesday.   Not trying to get you to buy GME just making a prediction.   Im, not a financial advisor this is just my prediction. Don't be stupid don't spend money you can lose. (Mods please don't delete)
Howcome at r/investing they call all of us "Bag Holders"?
what does that even mean???? what kind of terminology is that????
What was the deal with the silver attempted pxmp
I saw reddit tagged on CNBC, meet Kevin, and local news saying we were trying to squeeze silver. They interviewed a silver seller that said " I'm all out of bullion" Anyone track the origin of this bullshit? I know it wasn't us.
What is the value of this brand awareness   for GameStop?
You couldn't buy this type of marketing, but if you were to try, it would have to run in the hundreds of millions I would guess (without having the slightest clue lol).  In reality, surely it would be inexcusable/(impossible?) for GameStop to return to what it was. It's a massive industry, they need to connect themselves to the online community. Gamers are rockstars. GameStop in now infamous. They should just be a gaming/meme merch store.. physical and online. Be a community hub for gamers.. host events blaba They can give me a million for this advice  You might as well hold and see if you're taking jack shit out
Is there a pull back / correction coming within the next few months? 05-Feb-21
DDD stock question
So i've beeing looking into investing in general, and was wondering, what you guys take on the DDD stock shares are.     It seems to be having a "big" (not like GME) boost in stock price, and with alot of brokers limiting the GME share, do you guys think this could be the next best thing?
Will Tuesday bring certain, undeniable hope?
With figures being released will this be confirmation that we are winning the fight? It would be nice to have absolute concrete, undeniable evidence that they have not escaped their positions.
The truth about GME(from a long time member of the sub)
There are people on this subreddit current orchestrating a “GME is over”  . These people are complete bad faith actors and totally unethical. Let me explain: They don’t believe in the the whole idea that the price will sky rocket due to shorts being covered. They lied to you and then sold at $500 when the stock was pumped up, leading to its downfall. They saw this entire thing as a pump and dump the whole time, now that they made their money, they are annoyed that their are people who “actually believe” in the “myth” of a second(possibly larger) squeeze. You are literally talking about the same thing they were a couple weeks ago, now they are acting as if you are retarded for talking about it. This is morally corrupt hypocrisy on their part.   Now they want to shut the sub down and stop the millions who joined from discussing this idea, which very well could still happen.  Yes, people who sold GME(I say this as someone who never put a cent into it) you are correct, it doesn’t take some high IQ or knowledge in investing to realize that hype and trailing hedge funds drove the price to $500. But this wasn’t the original speculated reason for the short squeeze, that was hedge funds needing to cover shorts on a stock that was over 100% shorted, we still have the price $50 above what the price was when they sorted the stock. If they haven’t covered their positions, another short squeeze could still occur. You can not prove otherwise.  Anybody asking for the removal of GME posts because “I want my sub back!!!” Or “idiot apes don’t realize the squeeze has squoze” are ignorant, immoral, bad faith actors. They already sold and are out, for them, the whole thing was a pump and dump. DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE ARROGANT PEOPLE.  Edit:     don’t let immoral, ignorant people tell you it’s not. Decide for yourself.
We did it retards. We are on the cover of the biggest Trade paper in Germany.
My friend told me hedge funds are employing russian bots to mass execute short ladder attacks, trying to keep us from our $. HOLD THE LINE! DIAMOND HANDS   !  !  !
To those who believe "It's not a loss until you sell..." or who are having doubts because of it.
Foul Nut Sack pattern! Im bullish next week!
The Year is 2063
Next week is our! GME retarded warriors stand up and get ready to buy GME back to $500 on monday
Im not a financial advisor, im just a retarded warrior who like the stock!
I changed my life by selling at $400 a share. It's nothing fancy but I cut my car monthly bill by 1/3.
General question about day trading
I’m just getting started with investing real money. I’m a retard in college studying economics.   I’ve been trying to use papermoney in Webull to “invest” and apply my DD and it’s been going well. From what I can tell, if I were able to pay pretty close attention to stocks I could try to net 1k per week in income and probably be successful at hitting that goal 60% of the time. I’d want to start slowly and   up to that kind of money though.   So, once I have started to invest several thousand and an swing/day trading to meet a personal quota I could possibly live off of that, right?   I guess I just don’t really know how people make the transition from casual trading to having it be a main stream of income. Any big picture things I’m missing out on? Any resources (not youtubers please) that you trust and rely on? I’m liking TipRanks and the data vis on Webull is fantastic.   Guidance is appreciated!  Edit: I realize you guys have been bombarded with pump and dump assholes and maybe this was the wrong time/place for me to ask for information but I’m not sorry. Info is key y’all. I’m not trying to get rich quick. Thanks for the serious responses!
Tip to make 🤲  easy and avoid FUD.. Stay away from WSB on weekends, it fills up with shills and   .. come back Monday morning and enjoy the vibe.

Personal Liability
Given people are at personal liability for advice they gave on losses, should people choose to sue over GME, how have people covered their risk? My address and contact details have been given to a solicitor by the courts. What do I do. All I said was "hold".
DD on GameStop's New Hires
So, as many of us know, and many of y’all don’t. Gamestop was a VALUE play. A Deep Fucking one at that… why do you think DFV didn’t sell? The squeeze was the cherry-on-top. Gamestop is currently undergoing a complete transformation with Ryan Cohen and his chewy boys, Chris Davis, Reggie Fils-Aime, Microsoft, etc etc etc.  This transformation has progressed as of Wednesday, Feb 3rd. As Gamestop has brought on another 3 hires in order to turn the tide. So, as any smart investor should, let’s take a look into these people and see what they bring to the table.  \-- The following info is pulled from Linkedin    Matt Francis    GameStop has brought on Mr. Francis as Chief Technology Officer, a newly created role in the company. Starting Feb 15th. Leaving AMAZON in order to join.  Mr. Francis seems to be a strategic pick by Cohen, as he looks to be the   King of Transformations  .  In 2004, Mr. Francis worked with the US Postal Service developing new software that helped evaluate and manage large pallets from their customers. His tech is still being used today.  In 2005, Mr. Francis worked with Avenity, developing software that results in over 30% of the company’s revenue and developing the business to over 60 countries. Re-evaluating and redeploying staff where it was needed.  In 2010, Mr. Francis worked with Marchex, developing highly scalable advertising technology. He led major releases and empowered development to move at a faster and more sophisticated pace.  From 2010 to 2018, Mr. Francis worked with Zulily. Completely rebuilding and re-platforming their entire company onto a custom framework. Introducing new solutions, and building scalable data platforms. He bootstrapped early versions of most of Zulily’s e-commerce software that they still use today across merchandising, customer service, and data science. He also built a full team of developers to maintain said software. He expanded Zulily’s presence to Europe and Canada. Executive sponsor and leader of zulily's cloud transformation. He led the evaluation of cloud partners for capability, feature, and cost match, negotiated multi-year, multi-million dollar partnerships with primary and secondary cloud vendors, and organized and led the transition, schedule and execution plans for multiple teams. Helping Zulily reach $1 BILLION mark FASTER THAN ALL BUT 2 OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.  From 2018 to 2020, Mr. Francis worked with FlyHomes. He was responsible for all of FlyHomes technology, product expansion, machine learning, and data science functions. Mr. Francis led the re-branding team, creating a new logo, website redesign, and new branding guidelines.  From 2020, Mr. Francis worked with Amazon creating scalable databases to promote growth. He promoted a    Now, Mr. Francis has joined GameStop’s team. I expect Mr. Francis to use his experience throughout these past companies to help GameStop in its transformation. As he has done in literally all of his previous work.    Kelli Durkin    Kelli Durkin was Chewy’s Director/VP of Customer Service for 8 years. This is another example of Cohen bringing on his best players from Chewy. Think about how much people dislike Gamestop’s customer service, their low return rates, and such. I expect this idea of GameStop to completely change. Imagine the shift of meme culture on GameStop. Memes going from GameStop to giving you 3$ in-store credit for 400$ consoles to Gamestop giving you a full-time house, and a paying job for trading in a $20 pokemon plushie.    Josh Kreuger    Similar to Mr. Francis, Kreuger has experience in big companies like Walmart and Amazon.   He also worked with Mr. Francis on the transformation of Zulily.   This was a coordinated hire by Cohen, Kreuger and Francis worked together on Zulily’s transformation, now they will work together on the transformation of GameStop into an Amazon-like e-commerce giant.    The Conclusion    So, while many of you freak out about the squeeze, which may or may not be over, who knows, who cares. The real reason most of us bought in, in early November-December, which is what spiraled us to this point is the VALUE play of GameStop. That is the reason DFV bought, that is the reason I bought, that is the reason many of us bought at less than $20 and are still holding. GameStop has what Amazon doesn’t, stores all across the country that can act as distribution centers. I fully expect Cohen to build GameStop into a giant that mirrors Tesla's stock situation.  Tesla was the most shorted stock on the market, just like GameStop, it then grew to unfathomed heights and split, and continued to grow.  It is my opinion that Cohen will grow GameStop to a true value of $500+ that will then split and continue to grow. If you can hold,   HOLD  . There is no point in selling at a loss on a stock that will be through the roof in who knows how long.  TLDR; The new hires are strategic plays to further progress GameStop’s transformation. Hold. Gamestop will be a $500+ company that will then split, and we are all at a very nice entry point.
I bought 5 GME @ 75 I regret Nothing!
To the moon boys
Don't buy GME. Bad news. Don't do it.
Some people are still saying it. Don't do it.
Mods should have rule that people have to post their shares when making posts that they claim to be holding a significant amount
It just seems like a method of karma farming  Edit: my position   and it’s limit sells I’m still holding
After Chamath voiced his support for WSB, Hindenburg Research, a firm specialized in short-selling stocks came after him with an unsubstantiated and damaging “report” against $CLOV, one of the startups he backs.
"GameStop was “notably absent” from the list of 10 stocks that retail investors bought the most in January"
What a crazy concept!
I bought my 3 shares at $150, I was devastated when it hit $50. I'm a broke college student, but I'm still holding, you should too.
If I can be in college with zero money still holding, you can too. If you're preparing to sell for a loss, don't unless you absolutely have to. You're better off sticking in it for the long haul and landing on the moon with me and the other retards still holding. Don't sell for a loss, hold and get ready for blast off.  (Not financial advice, just a smoothbrained ape retard hoping you'll hold)
Find my stonks Robinhood, i know you don't have any
Might only have 7 shares but doing my part!

Some Things to Remember as we walk into the weekend
Disclaimer: I eat crayons for breakfast, and fill in coloring books with feces. This is not financial advice  1) The VW squeeze took over a month for the short squeeze to play out after the gamma squeeze (where we are).  2) The official short interest data that reports on Tuesday (Maybe? I've heard this may be delayed) will be reporting for January 29th. This information does not actually tell us much about the CURRENT state of shorts.  3) Stocks will go up and they will go down. Don't focus on the current "media" narrative on what's going on. Use your own judgement. If you still stand behind the basis of why you bought these shares to begin with (whatever shares you diamond hand bitches are holding) then just have some PATIENCE!  4) The lower the prices of these "meme" stocks go, the more powerful we are!! This actually gives us more buying power, so that as restrictions are lifted, as the squeeze commences, we can help drive the price up even HIGHER as we move forward.   5) Don't get distracted. The HF guys (and majority of the media) want us to put our focus elsewhere. STAY STRONG! This is a great opportunity to average down even further, and increase potential gains down the line.   6) DO NOT PLAY WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE! Sir, this is a fucking casino. Even with everything going on, stocks and the market (ESPECIALLY MEME STOCKS) Can be nothing more than a gamble. We are retards. We don't have insider information. If you're following the masses, and not investing LONG TERM into a company that you believe is undervalued or shows growth potential, you are gambling.      I'm just an idiot with a keyboard. Don't take me seriously. Stay strong and be patient everyone we got this shit!!!!!
🐳 🪓 Unusual Options Activity 102: Answering some questions/ deeper dive
Love and respect all the GME apes.  That said, no. This DD is not about that.  But, to appease you all, I will let you know that there was very bullish GME call flow activity today toward EOD.  ✌️   Long. Skip to TLDR if illiterate.        After the last whale DD   Question I got most is:     ’Yo.  I’m trying to use [Unusual Activity notifier, usually Unusual Whales], and the plays I’m picking are shit.  What do?   If you’re arbitrarily choosing it’s probably about 50/50  The good news is that there are a bunch of things you can do to raise that 50/50 rate significantly.    Last DD was, honestly, mostly a call flow thing—this is specifically for enhancing your whale plays, largely using Unusual Whales callouts.     Let's start with a random Unusual Whales play and see if we like it based on some stuff I’ll review here:       Beating the 50/50   🐳 🪓   I'm going to break the things I look for into two simple categories:   1) Urgency Indicators   and   2) Anomolous Indicators  .  Some relatively fluid combination of these factors--with a little bit of gut feeling thrown in--determines what I choose to play.    1) Anomolous Indicators: Price Difference, VOL/OI Ratio, IV    ❗️ Price Difference  ❗️    You’re looking for orders with price strikes so unreasonable that it raises your eyebrow.   This is your #1 clue for something potentially worthwhile--why are they betting so far out the money? Does this bet diverge from the underlying's normal price movement?    When my Unusual Whales alert goes off, I’m typically looking for at least 5% out the money,   depending on how close to expiration the call is.  That is not to say there aren’t a bunch of whale plays that are deep in the money or ATM and as valuable if not more— it’s just not my preference.  ❗️ VOL/Open Interest Ratio ❗️  This one is very important.    If Volume is higher than Open Interest it shows you 1: this is very very likely an opening call, not a closing call and 2: High volume/OI shows that the play is UnUsUaL, because the volume on the call option outweighs the amount of interest people have in the position.    So,the VOL/OI ratio is a pretty good indicator, particularly when the ratio gets into the   range.    A high ratio of volume on an order compared the average daily order volume is good, too.  You can check average daily vol on an option using Unusual Whales data on their site, or any number of other platforms.   💡Volume/OI ratio high=good.  Volume/Daily volume ratio high= good.💡  ❗️ Implied Volatility ❗️  So overlooked.  In the rush to be a part of the next boom, we are all guilty of picking up tickers with IV of like 400%.  To find the truly anomalous,   I always begin by looking for IV less than 100%  -- if IV is that low with a high % difference of strike to underlying, this is indicative of a major event coming that is unknown. For this reason I also always make sure it’s not just an earnings play.   💡 Low IV stonks=nobody sees it coming, high IV stonks=everybody sees it coming💡    👌🏿     2) Urgency Indicators: Days Til Expiration, Volume, Whale order price in comparison to Bid/Ask Spread     ❗️ DTE ❗️  The 🚨 emoji symbol is my favorite sign on Unusual Whales, and is a good general representation of what I'm looking for.    Although I’m not going to buy a weekly, I really like to see a call dated a few days-two weeks out as a starting point for inspection.    The closer their order is to expiration, the more I L I K E T H E S T O C K.  This is the first factor I'm looking for while I filter.  If it's a month or more out, I'm probably skipping. Again, plenty of valuable plays further out, it’s just my preference.   ❗️ Volume ❗️  Decent volume implies this move is in a relatively stable ticker, or at least ordered by somebody with a decent amount of money if they buy a ton.  We're looking for big bets, not some WSB kid willing to yolo his $1,400 stimmy because "EV is the future, bro".    We want large bets that indicate confidence and urgency.  Volume is how we get that.     ❗️ Bid/Ask Spread ❗️  This is important in a few ways.  The first is that you want the Bid/Ask spread relatively tight, say within a .10 difference.  If it's tight, it's pretty safe for you to play because you won't get burned when it's time to fill it.   The second is that if you’re looking at an Unusual options order, the whale’s bid is much more legit if it’s closer to the ask on the bid/ask spread. It signifies aggression and confidence.    . 👌🏿   Yes. I like the stock.          So, that’s that.  Hopefully it helped make some things more clear.  A couple other things to remember:     1.	Buy your expiry a week further out if you’re chasing whales on weeklies  2.	YOU HAVE MORE TIME THAN YOU THINK: usually the play won’t happen til at least the end of the day.  A lot of time I used to rush in thinking I’d miss the news and get hammered for a few hours when I could’ve just waited til EOD.  Stay liquid  3.	Be patient. Luckily every day theres a merger, a new product, an ARKK addition, or whatever the fuck for like 100 different stonks.  Opportunities will come, don’t fall in love with a play you don’t need to make.  Once you start realizing the myriad of things that cause pops, you’ll see the opportunities for them all day long  4.	DO NOT FOLLOW EARNINGS WHALES I LOST $1k ON FEYE THIS WEEK 😭     TLDR: You can increase the success of your Unusual Call Activity plays by looking for larger OTM, closer dated plays that have high VOL/Open Interest Ratio and low IV.  If you can, check the bid/ask spread to make sure the whale is opening an aggressive call position, not closing.         Positions when I do my weekly whales to watch, probably Sunday. GME 1,000 EOM         Now go yeet your life saving at some ridiculous out the money call.  Inbox always open.

HEDGE FUNDS ARE SINKING. PLEASE READ!!!!
Guys. Everyone knows it. The -10%-30% return that these hedge funds return. Just no longer beat the market.  The industry of hedgefunds has been sinking for over 5 years now and the fact that retail investors nearly drove a few funds into bankruptcy is going to worry THEIR investors.  PLEASE PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS.   My father has about   million in a hedge fund that has been returning him an average of 15% for 7 years. He says one year they’ll be up 70% the next down 20% the following up 10%. And he says that all his friends plan to withdraw and invest in the overall market that is just. Simply. Safer.  WHY DOES THIS MATTER ????  The funds KNOW of this.  They have been paying out managers RIDICULOUS bonuses. The owners just wanna cash in and GTFO.  Again why does this matter.  Well. Don’t listen to me. THIS IS NOTHING BUT SPECULATION. DO UR OWN RESEARCH.   There may be hedge funds that use this as an opportunity to absolutely CRAP on their competition. WHY would I invest in Melvin capital when black rock is the one that put a few others out of business (for example).... GET IT?????   But I think if the short float is anything above 50% come the 4th. THIS IS GOING TO THE FUCKING NEXT GALAXY...   IT IS IN THEIR best interest to filter us (the retail investors) OUT of this. To make the war of short squeezing much easier to be controlled by them and their partners.   GUYS JUST FUCKING HOLD. IF UR NOT AT A PROFIT. OR IF U DIDNT PUT UR RETIREMENT FUND IN THIS. WHY. WHY. WHY WOULD U SELL....

Am I reading this correctly? Short volume is increasing? Hedges doubling down?
So I was looking for some information about GME. I found a site,  , It shows the Short Volume Ratio increasing. From 32% on the 28th to 45% at close yesterday.      Do I understand the concept of Short Volume Ratio correctly? As the ratio goes up> # of shares on the market goes up>$ of share goes down.    Let me know where I am wrong here. The process of a Hedge Fund short selling more during all of this allows them to reset the call date on their stocks, unless the price goes up in which the shares they borrowed they have to return (original owner wants to sell them?).  Their thinking = Flood market with stock> drive price down> get current share holders turn diamond hands into angelsoft 400> they win by playing long game.       So they are calling WBS bet and raising having already shown their hand.      0 Shares
thanks to whoever posted the sklz DD last month
#GME should pay dividends at some point then we can all HOLD to eternity
think about it   ️
A post for all the consoomers who have yo sell their GME to buy some stock that will make them 30% return

Fire sale on AMC and GME. Get yours now! Squeeze isn't over til at least Tuesday.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the hedges who have been holding their shorts since before the squeeze may have until   Tuesday evening 4   ET   to buy the stock.     We need to keep the stock as high as possible and at least ABOVE $5 (someone give me the exact #).    If we let them purchase for below that amount, they get a profit and   we did this all for nothing  . But, more importantly,   we need to keep the stock high as possible to help those who joined the cause   and purchased last week at a higher amount.   People purchased when the price was $10-$16  . If you want future squeezes to be successful, you have to   show each other NOW that you can be trusted to follow through and HOLD THE LINE. Don't let each other down!!       So,   buy AMC   and   GME   while it's low and just hold at least until Tuesday after 4   ET. PLEASE!
Lets just say this was a Dick week of Hedgehoggies.
OK all jokes aside, next TUESDAY FEBRUARY 9 is the BIG DAY because we get to see whether or not Melvin Capital covered its naked shorts. THAT will cause a cascading SNOWBALL effect on the PRICE RISING to the MOON. This VOLATILE rollercoaster ride is NOT over yet. REMEMBER to BUY LOW and SELL HIGH!

GME went up over 10,000% from its lowest point in the last year and you clowns are still waiting for it to "moon"
It did moon. It went past the moon, past the observable universe, and is now crashing back. As a percentage gain, it went up 5x more than Volkswagen did (or more depending on how you measure that).  It's over, you missed it, and furiously bag holding and circlejerking is just ruining this sub.
My gains from SPY almost cancel out my losses from GME
Bull thinking of turning bear
After the past week or so, with all the market manipulation by brokerages and the dems back in office , I am convinced things will only get worse moving forward  I consider myself a bull, prefer to buy stocks going up, but things are starting to look like that will be harder and harder to profit on as these "restrictions" continue to happen  I use TD ameritrade and have had multiple multiple rip off trades happen , losing me a lot of money over the past week, I've never had these kind of issues before. All sorts of questionable things happening   What are Some decent long puts or any shorts that might be good to shoot for??
What are the chances of Feb 9th's Short Interest Data being skewed?
I mean they can pretty much get away with anything they fucking want.  What stops them from tinkering the short interest numbers so it doesn't look as bad?
Dude, is Hindenburg just the ultimate Wall Street bully or am I tripping?
Where were they with the GME squeeze? I feel like these guys are bold as shit to come out announcing their short positions especially against a fellow ape like Chamath. Chamath fucks.
Legend has it, he’s been holding $GME for 5 years now
And People mocked me when i spoke about Ocugen here..
Live look at all $GME holders that like the stock and know it only goes up 🤲🏻📈
Up 20% in my GME position, glad I held and didn’t sell earlier
Ford?
Ford  (Not a financial advisor, etc  ) What does Ford, GM, Will Farrell, and Joe Biden have in common?  E l e c t r i c V e h i c l e s (EVs)  The short: Maybe buy some Ford now and hang your hat on it? Maybe quick, sharp gains?  The medium: Ford- announced lines of full EV sedans, suvs, and trucks GM- announced lines of full EV sedans, suvs, and trucks (It’s worth noting that the market has already taken notice and stock has risen to the occasion) Will Farrell- GM paid him to do a super bowl commercial about it. Everyone will watch or discuss a super bowl commercial.  Joe Biden- announced that by the end of his presidency, many (all? I can’t remember) of Govt issued vehicles will be EV.   This is big because the USGov is obliged to buy American. Basically, Biden just wrote a check to American auto makers with that statement.  Once charging stations are widely available for all Fed vehicles (I say this because I’ve lived in the rural south where it’s not available at all), the population will have less hesitation when deciding to buy full EV or not.   Companies that produce batteries like WKHS would be a decent and stable bet, but I dont know how much more growth they’ll have in the short term.   Listen, I’m dumb. I’m a big dumb. I’m also sketched out about posting stuff because it’s my first time posting my own thread and I hope I’m not in violation of any rules.   I’m open to hearing countervailing points, and I just wanted to hear what you folks thought about my smooth-brained approach to this?
GME Review & short term prediction
# Disclaimer  I am not a financial advisor, I am not your financial advisor, I am merely an idiot behind a keyboard with zero stake in the game who has watched the GME situation over the past couple of weeks.  # Hard truths  Anyone who bought in at $300 is an idiot. Sorry if that caused any offence, but it is true. The risk/reward at that buy in is too much in the risk category. If the stock hits $1000, then after taxes you will only increase $350 per share; a mere doubling of value. However it had/has a long way to go to reach that, and it more likely (especially with action taken by the short sellers) to drop from there losing your stake. You are quite literally going "double or nothing."    $1,000 the hope   $10,000 the dream   $69,  the meme  Note that those who bought in at sub $50 and were just buying the dips to increase their volume and lock the short sellers out of being able to settle the account are not complete idiots. Provided your average value is still sub $100 then you are still in a good risk/reward area  # Optimistic view  The millions of units which continue to be traded out of hours is a sign to me that the short sellers are driving the share price down by buying/selling low amongst themselves. Driving the price down has two major benefits for them:    Share value drop will scare off new investors, and open up more opportunity for buying back the oversold stock   The daily interest payments on $50 are significantly lower than those at $500, which means that they are able to hold on to their shorts for a much longer period of time  # Pessimistic view  The short sellers have closed out their position, and the short squeeze has already happened. Likelihood of this happening is low, considering the volume of trade after hours driving the price down, but we will not know until Tuesday.  # Short term prediction  On Monday the price will continue to drop down to around $30-40 per unit. Tuesday when the short interest is revealed the price will react accordingly. If there is high short interest it will jump again, if it has indeed closed out then the price will continue to fall.  Buying it a small stake at $30-40 on Monday would be a gamble, but it has a much better risk/reward (lose 50% or potentially increase 1,600%)
WHO'S STILL HOLDING?
Loaded up at $65 this morning lets go!!!
GME investors take note
Heres why DBX is an insane value play right now:
to start with their balance sheet:    $  Billion is cash and investments.   ZERO long term debt (this is uncommon in the tech growth space, especially the cloud sector) .   With all this cash on the BS you are technically only paying \~ $7 Billion for a $9 Billion public market value.   25 forward PE which is crazy low when you look at the growth potential and compare to competitors premium in the space (most trade in the 100 - 1,000).  Market cap of $9 Billion  DPX is cheaper than when it went IPO  It is undervalued compared to cloud computing competitors.  Hellosign acquisition undervalued compared to competitor of $DOCU which is worth $45 Billion On its own.  $DBX should be trading 4x higher than it is currently based on the premium other investors are paying for competitors in the space    Large short float (  meaning squeeze potential as upper long term resistance is tested on volume, Stops will get triggered.   Relatively low float and market cap meaning it wouldn't take a lot of volume for this stock to trade 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% higher on a day with big news. Low supply of shares with high demand will cause price to go up.   Not many cash flow positive business have float structures this luctrave.   They are unlikely to sell new shares to the public if it does gap up as they already have lots of cash on the balance sheet and a cash flow positive business model.   Low risk of share dilution.     Closest competitor to Hellosign market cap of $45 Billion   This is 4x the size of $DBX which is at $9 Billion. Hellosign could grow to the size of $DOCU.   $DBX has a big potential $DOCU competitor with already great business and growing e-workspace business.   You are paying a cheaper premium for $DBX and it has more growth potential and is already profitable.   The selling pressure from $DBX has stopped and insiders and institutions are setting up long positions to play value tech.   $DBX has begun to break trend and outperform major markets.   Options activity on the 1 year chain shows a substantial long bias with traders accumulating calls.   $DBX will gain sympathy from a strong IPO market, cloud computing market, and tech market.   Investors who missed $DOCU 560% YTD run will look to add $DBX due to the HelloSign acquisition.   Relative rotation shows capital is flowing out of large cap technology into value tech.   Institutions have increased their positions by 50,000,000 shares.     Institutions own 84% of $DBX     A total of 463 institutions hold $DBX and 217 of them have recently added to their holdings.   There are 60 new holders who recently accumulated a total of 11,675,563 shares during the long term channel on the daily chart.   There has only been 7,766,483 shares sold by institutions during this trading channel.   This signals institutions are net long $DBX on a break of this channel and will look to add momentum lots to their position     My price target is $40-$ 200 per share in the next 2-3 years
Can we take a moment to consider the scope of the misinformation that happened?
The scope of the misinformation that happened earlier relating to GME was astounding. To the point where people truly believe that Reddit did push silver (even some Redditors that I've talked to).   Why aren't people more concerned about this? Some agent clearly buried reality behind a wall of misinformation for this event, and fairly easily as well. What's to say this isn't more widespread than I would've thought so before seeing this happen before my eyes?
IF GME Tanks Further
I've had a really good time and it's been totally worth it. I've learned a lot in general (previous stocks were all long holds), I didn't bet anything I couldn't afford to lose, and Reddit is again my favorite site for more than just jokes. If it goes up, I'll be even happier because all the other good things still stand plus I'm holding so I'll have made money. Thank you to everybody!
Why hasn’t DFV posted?
Y?
WHERE CAN I BUY AMC?!? LONDOM, UK
Tried all the ‘stock’ apps and they are all shit. Can someone tell me where i can buy amc please
Evidence that GME shorts are not covering
# Very insightful read. Please take a look.  source:    # Evidence that GME shorts are not covering  ### And why we cannot trust short interest data.     Short interest     - the number of shares that have been sold short (sold high to be bought    back cheaper later) but have not yet been covered or closed out, is expressed as number of shares, or percentage of the     float     (tradeable shares of a given instrument).   It is becoming clearer that short interest data is being inaccurately reported with the hopes of persuading shareholders that there are no shorts to squeeze. Since last Sunday, S3 partners are   that the short interest has dropped 30M by Friday 29th Jan.  An   for 28th and 29th Jan- considering the most ideal situation for the short-sellers, which doesn’t even take into consideration any volume from retail investors trading between each other, produces these results for the 28th Jan:     Shorts added 25M further short positions at an average of $280     While covering   positions at huge cost.   This likely did not happen for various reasons, including:     We have seen their ability to short-ladder and manipulate the price down. Why would they cover at such huge costs when they know they can wait a few more days to cover for cheaper?     If they did cover, the price would have surged drastically with buy orders and not plummeted as it did through Thu and Fri.     This calculation assumes that 0 volume of trades was executed by retail investors – virtually impossible given the hype at the time.     And lastly, there were very few shares to borrow at the time, only a fraction of the 25M result.   Now on Friday 29th it was a boring day with a volume of 50M,   of which were shares being sold short, so SI should be at   +   =   For SI to have decreased to around 27M as reported by S3 on Sunday, it would have required the covering of   Go back and read these numbers again.  ### It is impossible to cover   shares on a day of 50M volume, where   shares of this 50M were used to add further short positions. Even if every single share that traded on the day went into the pockets of HFs, the SI would still not tally up.    So how are we getting these numbers?     Hedge Funds (HFs) are conducting a  .  Short-sellers create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades. They  write  call options (another short position in the form of a bet/insurance) and sell them to Market Makers (MMs), while buying “synthetic shares” against these options as long positions. Synthetic shares are not a part of the original share float of the stock, and thereby the short-seller appears to have bought shares but they actually haven’t, as they cancel out against the short call positions they wrote and sold.  It’s basically a loophole where both short and long positions are drawn out of thin air, allowing HFs to maintain short positions that legally weren’t supposed to have (140% of float), and in fact the shares never get properly located, which trigger alarms and Failure to Deliver Shares (FTDs) that continue to be pushed forward for consecutive days, now at about 40 straight days.  Now everyone is waiting for the   next SI report on the 9th February  , but I seriously ask you this question: Who is to say that these numbers will not be inaccurate for the exact same reasons that data analysts are reporting?  ### The good news is, that with the above evidence you can be sure that SI remains very high to this day, no matter what News channels states about short-sellers closing their positions, and no matter what figures they regurgitate in our faces. We can never know the exact figures for sure, and you can be sure that it is far above what they're reporting, and that there still remains a high volume of shorts that have yet to be squeezed.    What can you do about this?    One way to put these HFs in their place is to   would take away all leverage from fraudulent short-sellers and force the naked shorts to cover immediately.

Before you decide to write a post about how GME bagholders are done or should sell, come here first
We get it big brain and big gainz dick boy. Squeeze is over. But why should the bagholders sell?  Opened up a position a 300+? Relax. Think about that money as something you won't be touching in the next few years.  The fundamentals and absolute sheer ridiculous marketing GME has benefited from this last few months are a great indicator of how this company has the biggest upside since its birth.  You also think that a billionaire that grew a business from 0 to a 40BN$ cap market FROM FUCKING SELLING DOG FOOD would invest in a company to engage in money laundering? Look at him, he looks like such a doll! You think he'd invest in a dying brick and mortar type of business if he didn't have plans to absolutely turn around the whole company?  Why would excellent Amazon executives join him on the ride?  On top of that, there's also the new revenue shareholding deals with Microsoft, new generation of consoles that just came out, and a brick and mortar structure that can still be used with new perspectives.  The evaluation of GME is still uncertain at this current point in time, but the future tells us this has a bigger growth potential then ever before (excluding the squeeze). Ryan Cohen is a master in e-commerce, and with all of this publicity, GME is and will be now in everyone's mind. Revenues will most likely see a great growth.  So before you decide to make a post to tell everyone how this is completely dead business, go back, put a bean in your ass, sit down and shut the fuck up.  This is not your concern anymore.  To the deep bagholders, if you can, drop your average cost the lowest possible, and maybe in 3 years or so you might recover more than half of your losses. Don't do it now though. Wait for Tuesday, wait until this clears out and see what picture is being drawn regarding GME's future as an e-commerce company.  I'm not a financial adviser, I don't even know how to make a toast, so don't follow my opinion.
SOMETHING ALL OF YOU SHOULD READ
Okay listen here you fucktards!  First of all, I want to say that I'm not writing this post in order to save my money that i invested in GME, I got 10 shares @88$ avg and I already forgot about that money because I would probably spend it on alcohol or some other stupid shit. I'm giving you a solid DD from economic pshychology point of view. I've finished University of Economics and Business, and am currently in process of getting CFA 3rd degree license. I wrote a scientific paper on the book " Art of War" and don't want to reveal my name for security reasons. In the book it says "Appear the strongest when you are the weakest" or " Divide and conquer" and tons of other stuff that is happening right now and that hedge fonds are actively using to fuck with your minds. I can bet with every one of you that hedge fond managers read that book and hold that book sacred as Christians hold Holy Bible. When did you Americans become so divided? You guys that made couple of thousands of dollars on the peak are acting like Jordan fucking Belforts and giving advices to get out, it's over and shit like that when really when you look at it mathematically it hasn't even started. They literally gave you the bread crumbs and you got out. That is not the spirit of WSB that I know, that I remember. There is one of the biggest financial frauds happening right now and you are letting it happen in front of your fucking eyes? Really nice, but that is not the Americans I know. We, people from all over Europe are looking at you, YOU have the power to stand for your rights and fight. Fuck me, but as far as I know you are the biggest democracy in the whole fucking Earth. Whole world is watching YOU, DO YOUR THING AMERICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS! YOU DON'T WANT BREAD CRUMBS, YOU WANT YOUR RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN FIGHTING SO HARD TO GET! NOW IS THE TIME!  I'm not financial advisor of any type, I just like the stock and think it's worth fighting for.
Hey WSB
I'm glad I found you. You guys are awesome and a great trading community. I've been doing this pretty much on my own for almost 10 years with mixed results and you folks are right up my alley.  That being said I'm ready to start making moves on the graphene market, so if anyone has any tips or has done any research separate of mine I'm welcome to talk about it.  Also too all of you fine ladies and gents. Nice cock.
Many institutions own the majority of GME and they did not sell !! Why FUCKIN SELL?
it has come to my attention that 80% of GME stocks are owned by the big institutions, and they didn't  sell. EVEN WHEN THE FUCKING PRICE HIT 450$. And paper hands and the hedge bastards are demoralising us and spreading fake news!  Listen here you little shits! this is a people war against a fucking system that spiralled outta our control! its a war against the forces who been fucking us for the last couple of years!! We do whatever it is to stop! them defeat em! gut em! if we got to HOLD we HOLD!! if we need more POWER we FUCKING BUY MORE!!!  I'm not a financial advisor!
Murakami Corp
Hey. Just saw the tweet of Dr. Michael J. Burry about how maybe we live in a time where the ironcoffinlid could finally come off. He recommended the stock Murakami Corp which is a company that produces rear-view mirrors and automobile cameras and stuff like that. Now the Thing is that this Company has more cash on hand (37bn¥) than their market cap (33,4bn¥) is. So as far as I can tell basically all net income is free for stock holders? And as the interest for the Japanese economy is gonna rise (coffinlid comming off) the potential gains must be huge. Can anybody tell me if im correct or just being stupid and missing something?   Here is the   to Dr. Burry's Tweet.
Discussion about $IPIX! COVID-19 Treatment
The old company name was "Cellceutix" and named changed to "Innovation Pharmaceuticals" after a lawsuit came about by a bunch of criminals to try and destroy the company, now the illegally naked short the company to make profit until the run the into bankruptcy.   They have a drug called "BRILACIDIN" they they have been working on for years. Recently it has been fast tracked by the FDA and they started their phase 2 trail with 160 participants.   Yes they are OTC Penny stock but it has been brought to my attention that the stock barely goes up and no news or media attention about the company.  So I was just wondering your feelings about the company and think if u think it's a legit contender.

How do you maintain faith in investing in the market after the entire market -- from the app on your phone through the SEC regulators and the politicians they answer to -- pulled the plug, kneecapped your winning play, and then plugged the stock market back in after confirming that you had lost?  Imagine sitting at a slot machine for weeks, patiently dropping quarters in, finally winning the big jackpot,   a maintenance guy comes up and unplugs the machine then a security guy shows up to ban you from the machine and escort you to your car. That's some next level bullshit. But what's even nexter level bullshit is waddling up to the same casino the next day and continuing to play there.  There are other ways to invest money, and other markets to invest money in.  tldr; Why would any rational retail investor continue "investing" after it has been proven that the system is blatantly rigged?
Diamond Hands
Here's a 30-second tutorial of what to do after buying GME
I learned from 2018 and will hold GME...
I jumped in on the hype about decentralized coins in 2018 and put a lot of money in. As everybody knows, it dropped pretty hard. My account lost 90% in value, but I never sold. Today I'm 40% in gains. I've learned my lesson and will use my experience to deal with GME. I will not sell with high loss. I will average the price over time and follow their development, with the new board and new cashflow they gained in the last weeks.  I don't know if I ever will be up in the gains but what I do know is the following:  Decisions need to be made and you need to stick to them. Deal with them, educate yourself and make new decisions. Don't let any emotions or shittalk make you buy or sell shares from now on! Many of my friends sold their coins after the big drop, with a huge loss. They told me to do the same, but I believed in a decentralized system and still do.Luckily I could cover all my GME losses and still have gain (but I'm still holding the coins and the GME shares). I think that over time things will change. This hype not only changed WallStreet and the way hedge funds from now on will infiltrate threads and discord groups. No, it also changed the way people see GameStop. For many it was just a Pump&Dump. For other people it meant fighting the wallstreet and for the rest it meant to support GME.  This wave of support (even the Pump&Dump) will change Gamestop forever and it could become something completely new. I'm not giving up on GME or on my money. I can hold longer, than they can play with the GME shares. The moment GME changes their business model everybody will change the trading strategy. And who knows, maybe I'll be break even someday.  I don't know how big GME could become or if it will fail. But I know, that I'm going to find out...     Edit: I bought GME 69@240  Edit 2: I'm not comparing Coins to GME. I'm explaining my decision process. I made a decision in 2018 and I'm making one now. I'm not selling because of a drop or because people spread shit about GME. From now on I'll only sell if GME is not improving...
it’s not much but i like the stock.   🏻

Don’t buy silver!
Hedge fund is the fifth biggest holder of silver if you buy silver that’s basically the reverse of GME. Don’t trust bots.
If you are Diamond Handing Gamestop, you should start buying Beanie Babies, too.
May as well double down on those profits!
Stonk Math-O-Matics
It’s our market now. Time for us to invent the math. I propose these metrics.  MC = Media Conformance Index = (Public Sentiment / Media Sentiment)  MP = Media-Pressure = (ΔPublic Sentiment / ΔMeda Sentiment)  MPRC = Media-Pressure Response Coefficient = Media-Presure x Media Conformance Index  CrayonColor = RGB(    255,    255,     255)

Hello traders! I come to you for some help
This is my first post here so I don't really know if this is adequate to this sub The GME Saga boosted my curiosity regarding the Stock Market, I read some beginner's guides about what stock market is and how people can be a part of this huge economic machine so I thought  to myself maybe one day I might just put some money in it,  try my luck.  The reason I am coming to you is for some guidance regarding a few aspects such as:  What online broker do you reccomend?  What makes a good online broker?  What "strategy" do you think a newbie should approach in order to play it safe and maybe  be slightly profitable?   Overall some good advice any of you can throw in.  I know I could just watch some more videos or read on internet but you guys are in the game already, experiencing everyday.  Any piece of advice will be highly appreciated and I thank you for reading this far.

This floppy dongus and the 69 price is the last time I check GME price. Now I know I’m supposed to hold   not an advisor, just seen a dongus and wanted you guys to know.
So true
GME is not over just because Some people think it is.
We have no up to date data RN   Nothing new to indicate that they have covered the shorts   Millionaires saying we should hold   Bots trying to spread fake news and distract us with bs stocks   News outlets spreading fake shit about GME and silver   Clear market manipulation   The list goes on   I don’t know about you guys but I’m holding this stock now and will continue to buy the dips as i believe the GME saga has yet to end.   Ps funny how game stop has been so quiet. Almost as if they are waiting for just the right time to make a big announcement.   Not advise I’m an idiot  Edit : a word  Also I hear GME has moved over to a different sub r/gme

WSB is being used as an alibi for insider trading.
Seems like we retards have just created a perfect fucking way for insiders to make bank. Check this out.  The massive amount of shills suddenly appearing in the media, claiming that any surge in anything whatsoever from fucking silver and uranium (who the fuck wants to buy uranium apart from toweheads with harems of ukranian prostitutes?) is the work of Reddit, thereby easily explaining any weird market fluctuations. We literally gave these assholes a way to create an alibi and blame Reddit for the weird, unincentivized moves that they make.  He’s an easy cookbook.  Step 1: get inside info about stock X  Step 2: make a few comments on Reddit here and there regarding the stock, or better yet get a bunch of bots to do it for you. Take screenshots in case deletion.  Step 3: get downvoted to hell because fuck you for shilling said stock  Step 4: make move according to inside info  Step 5: if SEC comes knocking on your door claim you read the info on Reddit and made an honest bet, thereby not breaching 10b5-1 and not using any MNPI
If $GME$ hits $150 this week I will buy every single item on r/activedeals & donate it to my local hospital.
I know it's coming, it's tough but it's going to be a rocket week. As soon as the HF have to pay their shorts we are up! I've invested over $20,000 CDN at around $40, so when $150 hits again I'm going on a charity spree getting everything on /r/activedeals . I've been down almost my whole life so it's nice to have a win finally, and be able to share it with others in need.
GME hit 300$ in the after hour market?

Robinhood is selling data to hedge Fonds, they know what your order is before you buy. Both making lot of money with these.
KURSRAUSCH BEI GAMESTOP:Robinhood verkauft Daten der Kleinanleger an Hedgefonds  Mit Robinhood wollten es die Kleinanleger mit der Wallstreet aufnehmen. Doch die Broker-App macht Geschäfte mit den Hedgefonds und gibt die Nutzerdaten weiter. Beide scheffeln so Milliarden.  vonDominic Benz  1 / 8  ￼  Beim Angriff auf die Hedgefonds nutzten Massen von Kleinanlegern die Broker-App Robinhood.  ￼  Damit trieben sie etwa den Aktienkurs des US-Computerspielhändlers Gamestop in die Höhe.    Wie die Markforschungsfirma Block laut «Tages-Anzeiger» berechnet hat, soll Robinhood im vergangenen Jahr 922 Millionen Dollar mit Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändlern gemacht haben, das sind rund 40 Prozent des Umsatzes.  REUTERS  Darum gehts  Mit der Broker-App Robinhood trieben Kleinanleger den Aktienkurs von Gamestop in die Höhe.  Die App schien die Waffe der Kleinanleger im   gegen die Wallstreet zu sein.  Doch es ist genau umgekehrt: Die App verkauft ihre Nutzerdaten an Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändler.  Dabei fliessen auf beiden Seiten Milliarden.  Es hätte David gegen Goliath sein sollen: Kleinanleger versammelten sich kürzlich in Scharen auf der Plattform Reddit, um zum grossen Angriff auf die grossen Hedgefonds zu blasen. Im Kollektiv kauften sie Aktien von maroden Firmen, um den Kurs nach oben zu treiben. Damit wollten die Anleger den grossen Investmentfirmen schaden, die mit sogenannten Leerverkäufen (siehe Box) auf sinkende Kurse setzen und damit Unsummen mit taumelnden Firmen verdienen.  Werbung  Im Fokus dieses von Kleinanlegern angezettelten Flashmobs standen die Aktien des US-Comuterspielhändlers Gamestop oder der US-Kinokette AMC. Tatsächlich schossen jene Kurse innert Kürze in die Höhe und bescherten Hedgefonds Verluste in Milliardenhöhe.  So funktionieren Leerverkäufe  Ein Leerverkäufer, auch Short-Seller genannt, leiht sich Aktien und verkauft sie umgehend. Er hofft, dass der Kurs fällt und er die Papiere zu einem tieferen Preis zurückkaufen kann. Das ist nicht unumstritten, wie Matthias Geissbühler, Investment-Chef von Raiffeisen Schweiz, zu 20 Minuten sagt. So könnten dadurch Abwärtstrends verstärkt und einzelne Firmen kaputt gemacht werden. Genau das befürchteten wohl die Gamestop-Fans.  Hedgefonds kassieren ab  Doch was auf den ersten Blick wie ein Sieg für die Kleinanleger ausschaut, ist in Wahrheit genau das Gegenteil. Zum einen sitzen nun viele Anleger und Spekulanten auf riesigen Verlusten. Denn mittlerweile ist die Aktienjagd fast vorbei und die Kurse sind teils wieder drastisch zusammengesackt. Zum anderen haben gerade die Hedgefonds mit dem vermeintlichen Angriff auf sie ebenfalls abkassiert.  Grund dafür ist die Broker-App Robinhood. Das Tool nutzten viele Reddit-User, um mit Aktien wie Gamestop und AMC zu handeln und den Angriff auf die Hedgefonds zu planen. Die Transaktionen sind mit der App gratis, da keine Gebühren verlangt werden. Die App schien die Waffe der Kleinanleger gegen die Mächtigen der Wallstreet zu sein. Doch auch hier zeigt sich: Es ist gerade umgekehrt, wie der «Tages-Anzeiger» schreibt.  Robinhood verkauft Nutzerdaten  Denn auch Robinhood muss Geld verdienen. Und das tut die App gerade mit den Hedgefonds sowie computerbasierten Hochfrequenz-Händlern – und damit mit den Feindbildern der Kleinanleger. So knöpft Robinhood den Kleinanlegern zwar keine Gebühren ab, dafür aber deren Nutzerdaten. Diese verkauft sie den Hedgefonds.  Die App gibt den grossen Investoren so Einblick in die Handelsaufträge der Kleinkunden, bevor der Auftrag abgewickelt ist. «Damit können diese professionellen Händler blitzschnell die Differenzen zwischen den Kauf- und Verkaufspreisen ausnutzen und Milliardengewinne machen», schreibt die Zeitung weiter.  Busse von 65 Millionen Dollar  Das Geschäft mit den Kundendaten soll die grösste Einnahmequelle für die App sein. Wie die Markforschungsfirma Block laut «Tages-Anzeiger» berechnet hat, soll Robinhood im vergangenen Jahr 922 Millionen Dollar mit Hedgefonds und Hochfrequenzhändlern gemacht haben, das sind rund 40 Prozent des Umsatzes.

Third year college student and I just sold
Zero of my shares because the SEC are going to have to pry them from my cold, dead, diamond hands       GME TO MARS
Just letting everyone know our sub is full of this now in case your wondering why everything is no negative. Tons of people spamming. Still holding...
Reason I am not selling my stocks.
I have about 318 stocks on AMC. I bought it in at $13 and I'm currently at -2k loss.  I have 2 GME stocks and I bought it in at $350. I am at -600 loss.  So, why am I not selling? Well. It's because why would I? Because I know sooner or later it will go up. This was the money that was something I can afford to lose. This hedgefund situation can last for days/week/maybe months. But I will still hold regardless because I know it will skyrocket in the future. The amount of loss you would gain is just not worth it at all.  Though I also do understand people who have put their life savings and they do need to pay their bills so they dipped out, that is completely fine. Prioritize your own living condition but at least don't risk your own well being being the market can be violent sometimes.  Try not to stress so much over the weekend. Just be patient and keep holding.
I'm planing to buy more
I'm thinking of buying big time when/if DFV is going to speak infront of the congress. Let's make the rocket go nuclear. GME through the moon!     Not a financial advise or a rally call. I'm just a professional retard who eats crayons. And I just like the stonk.
Let’s not give up on AMC and GameStop! 👏🏽 February 8th every invest now that it’s down to 6$ a share. All trading restrictions have been lifted. Let’s show em what we made of 🗣 📉💰📈
Transferred my account out of RH (had 5 shares of GME and $200k cash). They managed to fuck up so badly that they sent only one of the five shares to the new broker, and sent TOO MUCH CASH resulting in a hilarious $30 margin call. My account is deactivated so I can't deposit or sell. Unbelievable
I'll tell you what I am. I'm the damn paterfamilias.
Note to the mods
So I’ve been following this sub for the last 3 years or so(haven’t been active in it though, so fuckin sue me), and given the recent controversy between OG’s and WSB newbs I’ve gotta say, you mods have some work cut out for you. I empathize with both sides(minus the     ‘s scattered throughout. You know who you are.) and I want everyone to be able to enjoy the debauchery that is WSB. But given the huge influx of new actual retards, there’s going to have to be some kind of new organization to the posts here. I myself am a GME bag-holder and proud of   because the alternative is $ROPE and I’ve convinced my fiancé that we’re about to strike gold in the next couple of weeks(don’t worry, her bf is on board too for now so I’m good.) but I also miss being able to see actual QUALITY posts on this sub. The repeating posts are starting to drive me nuts and are making it really hard for me to want to check the content here. We need to keep a diversity of information flowing while also allowing people to speak freely about their GME jerk circle shenanigans- of which I will probably maybe participate when no one is looking. So figure it out please, because I don’t get paid to do   maybe neither do   you’re mods, so yeah...
Who else can’t sleep waiting for Monday’s opening bell?!
Stonks on my mind
this sub is now packed with glowing alphabetics looking to mislead, derail and demonize you.
“STILL HOLDING       😎 ”
I’m watching resident evil and GameStop is in it, meaning it exists in the future. If umbrella Corp can’t stop diamond hands neither can hedge funds.
7 million new users joined because of GME. GME Is here to stay for a while like it or not.
New users are still signing up.  GME discussions have not caused decrease activity in this forum.  It is fact that it is too early to see where this really is taking off. Fellow apes dont be discouraged by shills and bots claiming we want slv or plutonium, or those who want to push us out. As for those crying about too much GME posts, how about you leaves the internets for a while and attend your wives.  Im sure their boyfriends need a short break.
Autist analyst claims Reddit-short is behind surging $BANANA stocks
You're all just spamming/karma whoring now and it's not helping.
I hold 200 GME stock and even I find these low quality, desperate, repetitive, shitpost to be cringe, the worst offender being pleads for big names to help.   Take your Karma farming to another subreddit, and your desperation is apparent and not helping anyone.  If you're still holding GME, you believe that the hedges are shorted, and will lose money everyday as interest increase. All we have to do is hold and we will win eventually. Your desperate low effort post/karma farming is cringe and does not inspire any confidence. It reeks of weakness and uncertainty. It's also the reason for the "GME" fatigue. Well not shit, anyone would be fatigue looking at so much shit all day.  You know what does inspire confidence? High Quality Meme or DD. So shut up if you don't have either and stop spamming this shit. It's fucking embarrassing. I am just gonna enjoy the show, hold, and wait to see if I am right or wrong weeks/months from now.  r/gme
Stop your shares being borrowed
So you have some GME and AMC and you are    cos you're a legend.  Did you know that Melvin can still borrow your shares for shorting anyway?  If you put a sell price in, eg sell at $10000 then your share has an order on it and this stops Melvin from being able to borrow your shares.  Some brokers have blocked this facility, so while they haven't stopped you trading on shares they are handing them to Melvin in the background. So even if you are a    legend you are helping Melvin.  Set a limit!  EDIT  apparently this makes no difference, but a fellow ape wrote up some more helpful info on stopping your shares from being loaned.
This dip is not real and this isn't really happening
I didn't sell at $450+ and I wasn't wrong for making that decision, this is someone's manipulation and they are causing this to happen.  Possible candidates for my theory.    Citadel   Melvin   JP Morgan   Jeff Bezos   China   All of them together  I have concluded through my fibonachi technics that my portfolio value hasn't gone down at all. The price of GME is actually way above $1k and almost about to hit $6900. We just can't see it yet because someone is trying to steal my/our $GME.  Your probably seeing the picture a lot clearer now i've explained it to you, unfortunately my wife still doesn't believe me. She's told me if I don't start showering and remove the hand drawn price charts from the walls of the house, she's going to leave me.  At this point your probably asking if my wife is working with china. This is a big unknown for me, if true the rabbit hole is deeper than I initially expected. But I have plenty more cards up my sleeve.
Why I think something incredibly terrible and mischievous is going on here.
Dont feed the trolls. r/GME is just a divide and conquer strategy put forth by the HF pr trolls. They are trying to kill the message. I’ve never seen financial institutions behave this way. Your concerns about a Powderkeg I believe are well warranted considering the incredibly abnormal behavior we are seeing over a short squeeze, which should be a relatively normal financial event that has occurred many times in the past. But clearly GME is something else.  This is not my comment but it makes complete sense in why the trolls are full force tonight and even the past month. Stay strong brother apes   💪 👾 📈
Which one of you idiots did this?
Why you should step away for the weekend.
If you believe there is still a possibility of a GME squeeze, then nothing you read on reddit will change that. If you read the DD, understood the the squeeze, and the risk that it doesn't work out then remain confident in your bet.  Between bots, FUD and low morale I found it hard not to stay glued to reddit analying what might be going on. Even the search for positive bias felt increasingly futile and stressful. I was considering selling, not even for financial reasons, but for my mental health. But I remind myself I believed in this long shot, I decided to invest in it, and I'm damn well going to see how it plays out. So ive decided to spend this weekend on other things in my life that make me happy and return to gme with a level head monday. The stronger I am emotionally the stronger my diamond hands.   Or as my friend said when I began to doubt and panic:  "Relax and manifest Versace robe"   Tldr: manifest versace robe 🦔🔫
Wow this sub has changed
I was banned ten days when we around   million. Now we’re nearly at 9 million ten days later  In this spam of time, I’ve seen shitpost after shitpost, bots galore, and abundance of fake gain porn, a WSB mod coup, and a community full of newbs and normies (no offense).   Obviously WSB has become a greed fest for mods with its tremendous growth recently.    It will never be the same, RIP WSB.
The state of $GME and WSB
First of all, I am not a financial advisor, but a retard with a few shares, don’t listen to me.   I have seen a lot of mixed emotions about the state of the stock right now. Some true autists are still holding on to hope of the MOASS, while others are adamant that it has sqozen. Wherever you stand on this stock, if you have been here for more than a month, you cannot deny that there has been a massive shift in WSB. Granted, bots can be thanked for some of this, but there are a lot of new users who think this is a place for P&D schemes or “fighting the system”. At its core, WSB is a collection of retards who sometimes hit the green button at the right time and make “cRaZy gAiNz”, but mostly just post about the money they lost on an insane YOLO. WSB is NOT here to tell you the “next miracle stock”.   I am all for growing the community, but I can’t say I am a fan of what the sub is becoming. Thank you to the mods who care about keeping the community and aren’t just in it for money.   edit for retards: FUCK SHORTY, FUCK THE SEC, and HOLD (if u like the stock)
"One More Time" - An Ode to GME
Why GME is still getting catapulted to Alpha Centauri
Alright retards, I can barely read and I know the literacy rate of Zimbabwe is better than the literacy rate on this sub so I'll try to keep it simple. I truly believe GME is going to alpha fucking centauri and you should too for the following reasons     1. DFV is still holding. Need I say more? Unlike most of the retards on here with a college degree who can barely use it (including myself), DFV actually has credentials and studied this play to the T. How do I know? Go look at his history post. When we were pissing and laughing at the dude, he was compiling the thesis that would go down in WSB and stock history. Im a retard who trusts a geologist about rocks, why would I doubt DFV about GME? Hell, Id trust a dude with a cat infatuation over Cramer any day of the fucking week. 2. The shills. It's clear as day that our beloved republic is infiltrated by bots. These hedgies are unleashing their filth. How do you collapse an enemy? You weaken it from within. All this shit being flung from bot accounts is psychological warfare to incite paper hands. Why? They want you to sell at a loss or a measly profit so the hedgies dont get fucked nearly as hard. If the Squeeze did Squoze and the worse for the hedgies was over, why would they keep getting their bots to spread bullshit? 3. Papa Cohen. You read that right. Papa Cohen followed RoaringKitty on Twitter and unfollowed. I dont blame Papa Cohen for doing such. RC doesnt follow that much people on twitter to start with and doesnt want the hedgies crying market manipulation (ironic as that is). This is the same RC that tweeted a roller coaster and had to have it taken down cause his lawyers were strict. Fuck, I bet Papa Cohen is plotting to blow out the shorts as we speak and cant contain his excitement. RC following DFV briefly acknowledges that RC lurks on here. He's like a kid the night before Christmas whose over the fucking moon but cant open his presents, lest his parents give him shit. 4. Need rockets           5. Market manipulation. Last week, it took GROSS market manipulation in BROAD daylight to stall the rocket to Valhalla. Vlad proved he's a crony and a stooge to hedgefunds. RH will pay because of it. They already have. All this did was STALL how bad the hedgies will get fucked. It didnt stop it. Those fucks are just on borrowed time. 6. Ever since the peanut prophecy from our beloved Papa Cohen, he's been dead silent. He had nothing to do with the rally from 40-450$. A short squeeze to squoze needs a catalyst, we almost had it ignited last week but it took a corrupt fucking market to tank it. WAIT for the catalyst, we dont know who or what itll be but we just know itll eventually happen. Papa Cohen is the Messiah about to annihilate the anti-christ, were his trusted army of retards. He'll never let us down just as we swore loyalty to him and his mission to Alpha Centauri     7. Fuck the hedgies. I have no problem holding my shares, taking them to the grave, and letting my great-great grandchildren inherit them. For all I know, maybe theyll be worth millions by then. Ill take my chances with GME to beat inflation for the sake of my future offspring. Cohen turned CHEWY into a success, I have no doubt he'll do the same with GME regardless 8. All these dirty tactics were made to get you to SELL. RH and other brokers banned buying and didnt allow selling. Did you wonder why that is? If the hedges were covering as that was happening, why did the price keep dropping if the hedgies were buying to cover?  Anybody who sells at this point for a loss or a measly profit is more primitive than a retard 9. Its not that hard to hold shares and do nothing. Imagine youre the boomer who bought apple in the 80s and forgot about it. Lo and Hold youre the boomer who couldve been sitting on a gold mine and never acknowledged it till years after.  TLDR: HOLD TILL ALPHA CENTAURI. I HAVE NO PROBLEM TAKING MY SHARES TO THE GRAVE AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU
YOLO AMC 28k Shares Feb 5 2021. Yes I bought more and stop fucking selling you retards, remember apes together stronger. PS: I'm not fucking selling.     . Fuck the hedge funds, and fuck the wallstreet suits.
The inside of my brain on a Saturday morning after never buying GME
My worst investment of 2020
Someone explain what happened 1/28 7AM to 11AM
Saturday Feb 6th- Accounts being bought posts being disliked and negative comments and posts from shill bots !!
Today is really strange day,  many apes have been noticing the increase interest in buying Reddit account the last 24 hours. I personally have seen finance websites talking about   and     and explaining emojis wtf lmao  The hedges are getting extremely desperate!!  They want to know us and are spying and manipulating these forums. these are the boomer ways we have seen these tricks before but never this intense!   the time is ticking and we have them by the balls!   Monday I will buy more!                Don’t listen to me this isn’t financial advice I just like video games and this stock.
You gotta appreciate the mods doing some massive work to get this sub back on track
I-is it safe to come out now...? PALANQUEERS, ASSEMBLE!!!
-Multiple new partnership announcements. Check.  -CEO with crazy hair who lives in a literal treehouse. Check  -Creating skynet that will enslave us in an AI guided techno-hell. Check.  -Kathy upgrading Palantir which means something idk but probably also good news. Check.  Didn't watch their demo day but from what I read on here from people who also didn't watch it, it went well.  Earnings report on Feb 11. PLTR has beaten earnings projections in the past. They should be able to do it again, and we will be on a moon mission except we will miss the moon entirely and land on mars.  The ONLY thing PLTR has going against it is that the CEO doesn't wear a black turtle neck.   #THE FIRE RISES
Alright you degenerates, who is it?!

I will accept GME stocks as payment for my soul.
Modest gain porn, most holdings are long-term
The robinhood tin foil stuff may or may not be true. But what’s definitely true is that the media co-opted the short squeeze to build a narrative that we’re anti Wall Street and people ate it up
In the weeks and months leading up to the GME short squeeze, there’s no doubt that a lot of people here were talking about it, back when we were   strong. Never once did I see anyone on wsb say anything about sticking it to the shorts, or the inequality of wealth. It was always about an opportunity to make some money, same as always. This sub was rarely ever political in its discourse.   Fast forward to the peak of the squeeze, it’s all anyone is talking about even way outside of our little finance/stock market/casino world. They were talking about GameStop on espn, “New mets owner involved in GameStop short squeeze??” Anyway, even before robinhood limited trading, the media started to build this narrative that we all colluded on this forum to take down Wall Street. As someone who is on this sub every day, I never heard anyone say a damn thing about taking down Wall Street until the media started peddling this story and millions of new members flooded the sub with their far-left ideals. For those of you who have a negative opinion about Wall Street and got in on GME to try and take down a hedge fund, that’s fine you do you. But, I think it’s really important for us to recognize that that whole anti Wall Street narrative wasn’t here from the beginning, from my perspective the media put those words in our mouth.   TLDR the media is evil don’t trust a thing they say
Too drunk should I invest 800 thousand dollars on gme
Feral Forex....
Ok, admins please delete if not allowed but I just wanted to make people more aware etc    So on Monday this week I entrusted someone with a managing an account. (I know exactly what your thinking, "Why would you do that lmao")  So basically I run my own account but still go out and work etc at the same time and I wanted to have another "Managed account" running in the background that would work as a supplementary to my income if I was ever working or wanted to take a week off.  I entrusted Feral Forex with it as from everything I'd seen being a part of his signals groups and having his quite well done guide he seemed trustworthy. And due to the nature of my account, he couldn't withdraw any money, only trade with it and me send him his split. What could go wrong?   This guy puts 3   lots on gold longs, on a £2000 account with 1:500 leverage... The account was pretty much blown by him within 6 hours....  After asking why the hell it happened his only retort was "I didn't expect gold to drop so quickly" and then saying he doesn't cover losses after I say look ok these things happen, if you send me the money that was lost I'll put it back in the account and we can start again from there that way you'll also get your money back.  He then chose to ignore me and block me after I call him out for what he did on his Instagram posts.  I know you probably will all think I'm dumb and yeah you're right I feel pretty dumb for putting so much trust into someone...  Proof below     TLDR; Got scammed, feel dumb, avoid Feral Forex   also I'm a complete 28 year old Reddit boomer so please let me know if I've messed up anything in the post.
hi everyone, i have an important message
1. take weekend off 2. catch up monday 3. gameday tuesday (?)     idk me no finacial advisor  me like stock  38 @ 123
Sorry OGs. I just feel like with all these new people and possibly some extra FOMO starting next week, some basics might be badly needed. Just gonna leave this here for the new crowd.
WSB as seen by The New York Times
Fuck it. System is rigged
You can't  make this up. At first Robinhood and others across the world like t212 kills momentum by restricting buy -ins.  Secondly- post massive fall, restrictions still in place to drive stock down to the bottomhole. Restrictions are easening up gradually instead of being lifted alltogether as  stock is already 200% down.  Clearing house issue long time gone so why restrict? Once it's  start picking it up NYSE jumps with circuit breaker due to volatility. Wtf? Where were you when it was bleeding down?  NYSE stepped up in these 2 weeks more than i  last 20 years. FU all greedy scbags. I do love tbe stock. All the way to the   people are angry and rightfully  so. Apes  lets make them bleed and stand strong.  This is not financial advise
MRW I see fellow retards bet their entire life savings
I'm sorry, but what did you expect?
this time is different!    Is it though? short exposure aside was GME different from SPCE/DKNG/NKLA/PLTR/NIO etc.?   Like all those situations, we saw a huge run up only to be sold off a little over a week later.   Did limitations affect the price? Sure. But now they're lifted and nothing changed.   Hedgefunds can cover or at least recoup losses from buying and selling all those crazy OTM options.   Just feels like this is another day on wallstreet where little guys fought and lost interest a few days later.   Who really won here? The guys that lost life savings and morgatges?   Did wsb really stick it to the hedgefunds?
MVIS
I look back in the history and see a lot of people were loving and hating it.  Then no talk, and still no talk even though it has mooned the past month.
Any one have any other plays besides GME?
ROKU has been killing it the last few days. IV looks good but the premiums are expensive
$GME: I may haved discovered something, look at market cap
If i had a gun with one bullet in it stuck in a room with everyone from this sub, hitler, and adam sandler, i would walk out rich after convincing everyone here the gun will be worth millions in a week.
$BB has so much long term potential. If I can hold you can hold. If you haven't bought then now's the time. Great opportunity for entry while super undervalued
Proper name-calling within WSB
Autist: someone who goes balls deep in your wife for the DD like u/Deepfuckingvalue or sir jacks a lot.   Retard: doesn’t do much DD, but has been around WSB a while and sort of knows how to yolo their account into something an autist discovered and MAYBE make tendies.  Ape: a newbie who only came here for the GME/AMC/etc short squeeze and is actually retarded. Doesn’t even understand the basics of anything other than a simple long position in one of the aforementioned stonks. Thinks they know more then the autists in here.  I say this as a self-proclaimed retard.
Bought 52@250. $  down. Still in. WHO'S STILL WITH ME
Hey APES   , this is super easy. Instead of telling us DIAMOND HANDS     all how wrong we are. Short GME now and put your money where your mouth is. Those of us who still hold are about to reach the MOON!!!
These hate GME guys are all full of lip service but GUARANTEED are too chicken to short GME now. If you are so Bulliiesh on GME, why not buy some shorts and put your money where your mouth is?  ​  I'm holding 589 shares. Forget the haters.  🙏
How did Mark Cuban ever get rich?

I love the stock :)
Moon soon.
Shut the fuck up about GME
Seriously, I've heard enough.   Edit: Hoes Mad  Edit: Full disclosure, I am actually long on GME.
Is anyone buying any SPCE stock?
With the billionaire space race going on, there is only one publicly traded company involved (Blue Origin and Spacex are not publicly traded). Virgin Galactic is part of the space race and there has been growth of this particular stock. Do you think there is more room for growth?   One other stock I think about is Tesla. It grew alot over the last 3 years, and I see potential for SPCE in terms of a long term stock to invest in.
Can someone explain the “hold GME” mentality
So I’m kind of aware of the reason GME shot up (hedge funds had it shorted bla bla bla). So the stock shoots up way higher than it is worth and we fuck over these hedge fund douches. Ok got it. But why do I keep seeing posts to hold GME. The price is way higher that it’s worth what is the point or strategy behind holding something that isn’t worth it’s current value?
Why are they halting us
Somehow we drew the Emerald City in $GME

For Your Reading Pleasure: An Autist Loss Story
Ready for this... SUPER AUTIST MOMENT INCOMING:  Had two GME $115 calls 1/29. Sold one for 20k midday Friday and held the other til 3:58. As I go to sell in etrade power on my computer (in portfolio view), it times me out for inactivity before I could sell before expiration. I had been clicking around so not sure why. I immediately sign back in and go to sell the last one I had. I hit trade from my portfolio and send submit the order. I am  that I got another 25k more at the end of the day....  Well, to my surprise, when you open a trade order FROM YOUR FUCKING PORTFOLIO it automatically goes to BUY instead of SELL. (WHY THE FUCK DOES IT FUNCTION LIKE THAT IN PORTFOLIO VIEW WHEN I CAN OPEN A QUOTE FOR A BUY) Therefore, I ended up BUYING a second $115c 1/29 with 30 seconds left in the market. Immediately after I noticed, I was on the phone with etrade for 3 hours on Friday while having a panic attack. They said they won't know what happens til Monday. I look Monday and they exercise the calls for way above market value (217ish a share). Its Monday morning and now own 240 shares.  At this point, my etrade account says my cash is -$20k (owed to etrade via margin). I go to sell at market open to make up that 20k and hold the rest but it says if I sold those newly acquired shares, I'd get a 90 day ban since those shares/cash hasn't processed yet. Since I don't want to get locked out of my account for three months, I have to sit on those shares until Tuesday. Get an email Tuesday morning saying the money is due TUESDAY!  Well, as you know, it drops almost $200 a share into Tuesday and I essentially sold for a loss at $120 a share. I still have 60 shares left over and they are certainly not doing well either. Would have loved to use the money to tip some of my favorite local businesses a grand here and there but instead, just gonna stuff my face with comfort food.  Thats it boys, let me have it. Still holding my 60 with diamond hands because                                           TLDR - Waited for last second Friday to sell my 1/29 $115 call. E Trade logs me out for inactivity. Log back in with 30 seconds left, think I SOLD my call. Turns out E Trade auto populates a trade as a BUY. They exercise with margin -20k. Won't let me sell without 90 day ban Monday. Wake up to email saying I owe them the money Tuesday. Have to sell at $120ish.. Could of had $50k, have nothing.
Still down, still across 3 platforms, and still holding. Last week was tough.
Thanks Melvin!
And I thought November was an insane month for me going 10k to 100k...
Sometimes the little companies are the best
Let me make this simple...
Why Aren’t Hedge Funds Required to Fight Money Laundering?
Took profit (£314k/$431k) for $GME at $330 on Friday after a panic attack on Thursday. I’m 19 and this is the best start to life I could have ever asked for!
PSA: Get the fuck off WSB this weekend
All the Melvin interns will be working OT this weekend trying to spread FUD boys.  My plan: Stop coming back and reading shit posts. Go outside, get some fresh air, take your wife and her boyfriend out somewhere nice (well, as nice as you can afford now that you are broke af).  This is a mental game now. Stand by your decision and don't let anybody tell you what you should do.  It's a mental game from now on.  That is all. Godspeed fellow apes.
Saw this on instagram, I thought it was a pretty cool take on this GME stuff
Smooth Brain Broke College Student is Now More Broke
I put about $600 into GME. I have $187 currently from that. I let it get to my head that I’d be doubling or tripling what I put in. That was not the case. I clearly had a problem by putting more into GME when I could not afford to lose it.   I’m still going to hold because it is a reminder of my idiocy by getting caught up in a movement too good to be true. I still agree with the message but there is a point where I have to realize that I have lost.   I’m putting this out there because I want other people to snap back into reality, but still be reminded on what not to do trading stocks.
WE HOLD!
Follow the food steps of our lord and savior DFV.
Nothing has changed since the time when DFV started accumulating. Shorts haven't covered. Gamestop is pivoting to a successful   tech   company.  The last week's pump has given us data points on what the squeeze would be. 1) We keep doing what we were doing in the last few months and it scared Melvin shitless. 2) The actual short squeeze will be much, much higher than $500.   Remember what we did before Melvin crying to his citadel big daddy. Remember how we got there. Remember why you put money in GME in the first place.
I finally beat the game
Do you think it's over? Do you think this news would run in the media if it was over?
So they use bots to crawl social media and halt stocks automatically if there's no corresponding news from main sources? interesting
Lol GME is stupid af
We posting GME gains yet?
Hedgefund Pros vs Wallstreetbets
GME IS NOT OVER. PURE FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS: (WHY HOLDING AND BUYING WILL ALLOW US TO WIN)
Short interest was 140% at one point. But please try and understand; this means that even if they were to purchase all outstanding shares, there would still be artificial stocks left over which need to be bought to cover their positions.  Because this is true, every-time someone buys more shares at this time (whether it’s to cover or hold) an I-O-U and an FTD are generated simultaneously.  If there are no authentic shares left to cover for short positions, whenever an investor purchases a share then a broker has to generate an I-O-U instead. This is what creates the artificial supply of stock in the market, and this is precisely the huge problem for institutions.  Every-time this happens, the amount of phantom stock that needs to be purchased to to cover all of the I-O-Us in the system increases. The system is not supposed to have shares that are unaccounted for, and someone (the people failing to deliver on short positions that generate I-O-Us in the system) will eventually need to buy them to restore the balance of the system.  Usually this isn’t a problem for them, since they are able to drive the price of each share so low that they are able to acquire all of these phantom shares at a ridiculously low cost to where it just doesn’t matter - they still generate a profit even if they have to buy a bunch of shares that don’t actually exist.  However, we have the power to use their own strategy against them. By forcing them to generate more and more counterfeit shares to meet the crazy demand that they create when they ‘strategically fail to deliver’ (by generating I-O-Us they need to pay for later) we can force the cost of shorting to increase and force the price of shares to rise. This has the potential to create an even bigger squeeze (if my assumptions are correct).  So, the plan is the same as always: hold and buy relentlessly. The more we do this the more times their short positions fail to deliver. The more FTDs = more I-O-Us. The more I-O-Us there are, the higher artificial supply rises. This raises short interest whilst bringing the price of each share down. However this causes a chain reaction if people continue to buy during this period. The cycle wont end and they will be stuck forever generating artificial stock/counterfeit shares to cover the debt of shares they created. This will dry up their liquidity and cause them to cover massively very quickly eventually. This will cause squeeze    Essentially, it’s like musical chairs (but with a few twists) As long as the music continues, more participants can play than there are chairs available, but when the amount of FTDs and I-O-Us in the system increase and deplete liquidity, the music stops and everyone needs to find a seat.   Even if all the retail players left (sold) and they had all the chairs to themselves, there still wouldn’t be enough chairs for them to keep the game balanced. Instead, they’re hoping that all their players that got to sit down are allowed to leave after this round. This way they need less of their players to sit down next round and the game can become balanced once again. We cause problems when we all decide to join the game and play with them - since there will never be enough chairs for everyone.  Eventually, there are loads of players, but hardly any chairs. When the music stops, demand for a chair is high and each one becomes more valuable. All the players that didn’t get to sit down now have to pay the host to allow them to continue playing. But they need to buy our chairs off of us if they want to eventually leave the game alltogether.   So my message is this: Please do not get discouraged. This moment is unprecedented. I really don’t think people understand how crazy 140% short interest is/was and the implications of this. This is what Michael Burry was referring to in his tweet about his broker not being able to find his shares in May (or March? I cant remember) 2020. There were so many counterfeit shares in the system even back then that he realised this and I feel like he was implying that this is how we win. By gaming their own game.  This is not financial advise. Only invest what you can afford to lose - like me at a measly   shares @ avg £130 cause i’m a broke boy.
Me, when GME spikes rapidly
Elon Musk is no Tony Stark
Elon Musk (South African) is just an early investor who invested 6 million he had won selling his Paypal stocks months after Tesla was created by Eberhard and Tarpenning (Americans)  Elon likes to take credit for Tesla and the Tesla vision and mission, but he had nothing to do with its creation.   In 2009, Elon used his lawyers to force the original founders Eberhard and Tarpenning through a lawsuit, that Elon won with his power, where he was granted the "right" to call himself a co-founder as well.  No wonder he supported Trump. He is just like him. He likes to take credit for things he did not even create.  He is no Tony Stark. He is just a bully investor who stole the credit from two American engineers.   He has used his persuasive tacticts to accumulate a cult of young minions that have invested all their savings in a company that produced losses until 2020.   In 2020, Tesla had a positive net income for the first time since it was founded. The 2020 net income was a microscopic 721 million, which is nothing compared to the tens of billions that Honda and Toyota made in 2020.  Based on car sales, it is worth 12 billions.  Tesla is recalling a big portion (+130,000) of its cars while it only produces 500,000 a year. That forced Elon Musk to appear on Instagram this week to persuade his brainwashed young investors to buy the dip. He is a master manipulator.  Young investors will get burned, and he doesn't care.  Tesla is a bubble. It will make many investors lose a lot of money. See GME, individual investors got burned really burned while hedge funds made hundreds of millions in profits.  Hedge funds are already pulling out of the Tesla bubble. All the naive investors will get hurt again when Tesla collapses.  Tesla has not grown in a month. It already achieved its peak weeks ago, and has been declining.  You should realize your gains.  Ford and GMC are making better and cheaper Electric vehicles than Tesla. Ford and GMC will lead the EV market in one year. Europeans are no longer buying Tesla. Tesla was not even in the top 2 Evs bought by Scandinavians last year.    The company was productive for many years but it already reached its peak. There is no more room for bubble growth. The cyber truck failed that's why it is not out yet.  It is all a frenzy.  Many scientists have always had their credit stolen by bullies throughout history. This is just another example.  GMC and Ford will dominate the   EV market.  Tesla does not even have repair Tesla shops to handle the recalls. Tesla has to get into agreements with local repair shops to fix that mess.  Tesla is not Space X.  Elon did not just bully the real Tesla founders. He also bullied his employees, and they took him to court.
You'll never been the man your wife's boyfriend is
Got your attention? Now listen         -  I am about to go full Auntie here so bear with me.  Reddit is my "home". To me wsb is like a frat house down the street. There is always a party, if I wander in I am left shaking my head at the "silliness" and what seems like carelessness with money. However, these guys and girls mind their own damn business and apparently business is good.   Last week 8 million? people walked into their home. Party right? For a day, maybe. The sub was flooded with nonsense posts and comments, flooded with people asking basic investing questions. You know what these guys said? 'If you need investing advice, you're in the wrong place, and you should probably sit this one out.' Some of them cheered with you (emojis...  , etc) because the outlook looked great. New people started talking about risking way too much and these guys partied with you for a minute, then some of them said, ' 't bet everything" because they know better. New people booed and downvoted, the same people who were days before asking for investment advice, explained to these silly seeming experts how it was done. So, they said, 'oh   do you'.   Everything peaked, everyone celebrated, these guys told you to get the fuck out before it fell too much. New people downvoted them, called them bots and shills and screamed over them.   When it kept falling some new people had the fucking audacity to say they had been used by wsb in a pump and dump scheme. Never mind that all of this was in motion and rolling before most of us had heard a whisper of it. They didn't need you, they didn't invite you, though they would have at one time welcomed you.   Now the new people left are spamming the board and they've stopped giving you advice because they're being downvoted and generally treated like shit in their own home at a time when they would probably like to reflect on what just happened, and do mathy, geeky, chart reading things with their friends. Instead the new people just put "What's New Pussycat" on the jukebox for the millionth time, and keep telling the homeowners what they're supposed to be doing in their own home.  Meanwhile, these people are being scrutinized by the freaking world, this party is over, some of them lost money, some made money, and their home is trashed.  You just made an entire post on this sub, the equivalent of tapping a glass and declaring all must stop and listen, then when they respond to you, you ask them why they can't just be quiet in their own home.  I do hope my ADHD brain made all that make sense because I'm not going back to edit. I don't know the people in this sub but I've been following all week just like everyone else. WSB may be the rowdy frat house next door, but as a fellow redditor they're our rowdy neighbors. They will surely welcome anyone in but the best advice I can give all the new people is Talk Less, Listen More. Give them a minute.        Credits goes to u/angieb15 the original commenter
Someone who understands the last month
Ok I know this is the unemployment line and the dumpster behind the Wendy’s and the slot machine, but I don’t think there’s anywhere better to ask.    A few weeks ago I made a video looking into ornamental gourd futures guy, and I want to do a similar one about DFV and G m st p.    I’m looking for someone smarter than me who can help me understand and explain the technical/financial build up to the last month. Melvin/Citron/Citadel, Short Squeeze, short ladder, everything else.    I can’t pay you very much as I don’t have a lot of money, but we can discuss something.
Hedge Funds Keep Failing to Deliver on What They’re Selling. (2019-04-25)
Just a suggestion
How about all you soon to be Wendy's burger flippers legit morons create a sub of your own something like /wallstreetapes or the more appropriate /wallstreetsuckers and gtfo of here?  You poor 12 years old bagholders unknowledgeable useless imbeciles clearly don't belong here so why force something that doesn't work?
What’s with the sub? STOP being bitches!!
Listen. I know your bummed because we didn’t reach the moon this week... but we are still on schedule for moon landing !!!     The stock doesn’t go up forever wtf you think? This isn’t some Disney story  that ends in happy ending?! Stock go up and down all the time !  Some one is going to lose and get hurt. And we already know who lost $53 billion.   The stock went up and now it’s coming down so what do you think will happen next. Brrrr!   If you need cash sell 1 stock at a time and make it work till the end of the month . I personally have live broke,  and survived broke,  remember 2007-2010.   March is my goal that we go back up and if we do you’ll have extra profit money for next month  , if you sell your ass would be broke af right now and let the hedge funds win! Fuck that .   Hold!! Buy the dip!!  This is not financial advice I don’t know right from down and up from left, and I eat crayons.
IS EVERYONE HERE LITERALLY A RETARD?? HOW CAN YOU GUYS NOT SEE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED TO US??
I don’t know if i’m missing something, but I really think people have allowed the novel opportunities of this unique situation to go completely unnoticed thus far.   First, I’m going to make a big assumptions that I think is reasonable, and while it may not be what some people want to hear, I will aslo explain why i believe it is also nothing to fear (Lol that rhymed).   The squeeze has been squoze. I’m sorry to say it, but a 1600% in less than almost 3 months is unprecedented. The price rose because the shorts covered. It’s really that simple. It perhaps could have gone higher but as we all know ridiculous margins were used to halt buying from brokers, and the momentum was killed - which allowed them to use naked shorts to lower the price so that they could cover at a smaller loss and also limit what retail investors could gain.   BUT-  this isn’t all doom and gloom. Even if they covered on the short positions the interest ratio isn’t magically 0, and the short interest percentage isn’t suddenly 0%. These institutions probably saw the peak of $480 and from there on instantly started shorting again for those easy dollars (bearing in mind not one single institution shorted $GME 140% alone, and not every single institution has placed a short position in unity). No one has seen a squeeze happen twice in succession in history before right? A safe bet. Or is it?    For one, I think it’s fairly obvious that certain institutions have been selling naked shorts (OTHERWISE CALLED  ’STRATEGIC FAILURES TO DELIVER’ ) throughout this process for damage control purposes - but I truly believe all it has done is reset the timer on an even larger and scarier time bomb. Naked shorting is definitely an illegal activity, but unfortunately it was grandfathered by the SEC, which has allowed it to remain a popular strategy for institutions to use to lower the prices of stocks that they are short against.  If this is true (which I honestly think is most likely), this means that more shorts we’re created in the process of covering these short positions. Think about it. A ~140% short interest percentage is unprecedented. Insane margins that prevent buying due to 0 liquidity are extremely rare.   THERE WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN THAT MANY SHARES AVAILABLE TO  TRULY  COVER ANYWAY.   That’s a STEEEP crash from $480. Do you really think everyone simultaneously chose to sell at $480 once buying was prevented? There are a LOT of what you guys call ‘bag holders’ (I say  🙏) which is pretty evident from the state of a lot of subs. I think the hype was real and a lot of people held - not to mention that people were also actively buying large amounts of stock throughout the run-up to the peak, increasing the amount of people trying to get their hands on these shares that were needed to cover, and thus causing the artificial amount of shares in circulation to increase.   In essence, how many I-O-Us were generated in the process of covering would have drastically increased due to the buying pressure leading up to the moment brokers were prevented from allowing RIs to purchase more stocks. Remember: the amount of stocks they needed to short was LARGER than the amount of outstanding shares by 44% so they could have only immediately covered just over 2/3 of what they needed to cover without creating more I-O-Us in the process (granted people weren’t paper-handing in large enough quantities just quite yet).    This is what I think is the true reason as to why buying had to be halted from their perspective. Before buying was halted EVERYONE was in solidarity with holding, so the price drops we see during these periods where buying was prevented must have come from these aforementioned naked shorts - to give those paperhands the nudge they needed to sell, so that they could eventually cover their positions without creating more of those FTDs. THIS is the stage that we are currently at right now.   EVERYONE CURRENTLY HOLDING THE BAG MEANS THAT IT DOESN’T MATTER WHETHER THEY COVER OR NOT.  Everytime an FTD occurs, someone’s stock goes missing. Essentially, someone that decides to purchase one of these stocks (or someone that already owns the stock) now has to receive an I-O-U instead of the stock itself. This creates artificial supply. Essentially, there are more positions open than there are stocks available to cover, so even when they have covered their shares, they still need to buy more. Their demand for shares hasn’t decreased until they can close literally all of their short positions because if they want to cover all of them they have to create more FTDs, since the shares they need to buy don’t exist.  This is the gist that I’m getting at. Holding during this stage is paramount, but buying even more so. The more buying that happens during this stage, the more I-O-Us that need to be created by brokers, since they themselves can never get the opportunity to get their hands on shares that haven’t been artifically created to meet the supply of the crazy demand that they imposed on themselves.  The more I-O-Us they create, the debt of shares they eventually have to buy back to cover increases. Its pretty much directly correlated to the short interest. It also increases how much it costs to short the stock, and thus how much the insitutions bleed before they’re eventually forced to cover their positions.   From these assumptions and speculation, it is clear to me that any short holders have set themselves up to be squeezed over and over again so long as they continue to short the stock whilst FTD’s remain to occur and retards are willing to buy. It’s like a perfect counter to absurd shorting.   If this theory holds true, to completely simplify it: as long as [Percentage of shares held] + [Percentage of shares shorted] = >100% for long enough + additional buy pressure = SUPER DEMAND for stocks as every new buyer creates a new I-O-U that needs to be covered for later.   Ill sinplify it even more for you:   More hold, more buy at dip,   Furthermore, I think it’s fairly reasonable to suggest that other institutions recognised that the shorts were covering and also wanted to short that ~$480 price tag, so the short interest might not be too far off what It once was come the 9th Feb.   Now that I even think about it, as long as there are large amounts of FTDs with simulatenous large amounts of buying, I don’t see why we even require a large amount of short interest. If we keep generating I-O-Us then the cost of the short positions increases, which again increases demand for stock, and thus increases the price further. Essentially, you can make them cover by forcing them to spend an absurd amount of money trying to generate the counterfeit stock they require to plug the whole thing (the so called ‘strategic fails to deliver’).  In other words: Our high volume of buying during periods of high FTD occurence causes liquidty to run out for brokers. This forces shorts pay higher interest. This puts pressure on covering. This drives demand and increases the price. This gets you tendies.   This is literally how they get away with driving a stock to bankruptcy and no one notices where all of the counterfeited shares went - they just do the opposite. If they can manage to drop the price low enough, the I-O-Us are cheap enough to where they can pay for all the shares that they owe and discard them - because its nothing in light of the fact that they made a healthy sum off of shorting the stock in the first place. But we can be the driving force that flips this process on its head. We can use their ‘strategic’ failures to deliver against them.   I’m sorry if there are some things that don’t hold up to scrutiny but this all makes perfect sense from my limited understanding.  I just think that this has been a unique moment in financial history. We find ourselves in different circumstances than the past, and we are now able to achieve greater things if we are organized.   Also, i’m really sorry. I’m on mobile, and I was not expecting to make this post this long. I look forward to hearing how viable people think this theory is.   A Measly   of $GME @ avg £130.   THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I LIKE THE STONK.
Copper - Industrial Amounts?
Does anyone know where I can get industrial amounts of copper? Looking for large bricks 10000oz+
I'm holding because it is simply the most rational thing to do. I'll explain why:
SO these short people are basically fucking gamestop, the store where we went to the midnight release for call of duty ghosts are 12am when we were in 6th grade, and doing some shit that is obviously bad and crazy and these people on reddit wsb said fuck that -we like the stock and DFV came in like an eagal -just woah.  anyway,  that got fucked and then people said fuck that and bought gme  and were like saying fuck the hedges and shit.  And this sub, blah blah blah, but informed me that the hedges were doing all this propaganda shit against the reddit and that makes me like, damn, they're scared ass mfs rn running shit, shutting down GME trading and they're sending bots here and ew. it's just so gross and yucky and makes me ant to buy GME and AMC. To be honest, I bought 2   AMC calls for feb 19 and an 15 and had no idea that they'd blow up, I've really been only following GME news but I condone both, as financial advice. THATS WHAT IT IS. Who cares. Can your uncle give you stock advice and not get fucked? I'm your uncle. Chill. I 'd say to buy GME and hold it because they're scared as hell of the price going up and we CAN do that... lol. It's obvious that the people (DFV) did their proper DD that helped all of us (let's be real, don't we just look for people that say they do DD and say that we do DD by looking at that? lol).  So now we keep doing this thing that makes those guys scared as hell because that means them losing money, which means the people (us\_) getting it, which means let's take this opportunity to do it, idrc they do it all the time. Plus no matter what they'll live. Like they can eat. Not 100% of people in GME can. Maybe like 99%. but still for that 1% let's fuck that hedge %.  And I'm ready for this to be a crazy moment for a ton of people and it's gonna be really really weird. I'm kinda a fortune teller and I can see images of walking in the store and talking to someone about GME and it turned out well. Just my ADVICE. Dude if you're taking my advice it is = to taking some random guy's advice. No way can you use a random guy giving you advice as some lawer shit idek.
The "This is a long term hold" for me people that bought in at 100+
What am I missing exactly? Amazon and Netflix are up 500% over the last 5 years. A 500% increase for GME would roughly put it around $160 (if we're generous and take the price 5 years ago at 27 and not its low of 4).  You are expecting GME to perform as well or better than Amazon and Netflix the past 5 years in the next 5 years? Am I simplifying this too much or are you guys just extremely delusional? I most certainly don't know shit so educate me.
Put yourself in their ( HF) shoes! You would do ANYTHING (and I mean) ANYTHING to keep this from happening!
If I were them, I'd try EVERYTHING in the book to keep you from cashing out. That is why they are BILLIONAIRES! They DO NOT get to be THAT fucking rich without shedding blood, cutting throats and being scandalous! PERIOD! For all you "new-to-trading"   DOES NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT! I know TONS of you lost momentum b/c you thought it would be a "millionaire-over-night" scenario. WE WERE WARNED THAT THIS WEEK WOULD BE ROUGH!!!!!! WE WERE WARNED THAT THE ATTACKS WOULD HAPPEN! You paper handed asshats that sold can suck it! WE OWN THE STOCK! It isn't "down" if you do NOT sell! Man   has been put so plainly so many times. DO NOT SELL!!!! When/  goes up to $400 (possibly 7-800+) next week, or the week  ! Don't be happy with breaking even! WE CAN LITERALLY TAKE IT TO THE MOON!!!!!!!!!!!! HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, I know TOO many people are already burnt out on this GME stock (only been a week LMFAO) but you have to HOLD for longer if you want the desired end result. Plain and simple! Like I said in another comment:   the fuck   WATCHING YOUR SCREEN 24/  relax! Even if these HF fucks are violating every security and breaking every   for it! BUY MORE AT THE DIP, IF you can afford it! RELAX. It has only been a week! We were told about this TOO many times! TO THE MOON!     Obligatory: Not a pro. Do NOT listen to me b/c I eat non-food items. Monkeys, flying aircraft, body parts, precious gems, POS mentally ill degenerate worthless fuckwad.      Just fucking HOLD!
Honest question, how was dropping the price supposed to convince us to sell?
Full disclosure, I'm just a retard who only got into trading because I fucking love the stock so my understanding of the market ain't perfect  I got in @300 so I saw a 30% "loss" the first day which became a 75% one the second day, now this may be the first time I throw money in the stock market but I've been a gambler most of my life and there is no way I would cut my losses when I have already "lost" almost everything   Literally my only instict was to double down and buy more and the only reason I didn't is because revolut had at this point blocked buying GME and AMC  If I think it through dropping the price so low while I had bought so much higher is the single best way to convince me to buy more, I would never accept such a big loss so the only option is to hold and wait until the price goes to the moon and if my only option is to wait for the price to go up it's only logical to buy more while it's low so I'll make a much bigger profit in the end   I may be missing something because I'm an ape but from my point of view the hedges and whoever is advising them on ~~human~~ ape psychology are fucking retarded, the only one more retarded than them are the people actually selling   Now if you'll excuse me I have to go sell my kidneys so I can panic buy at open on Monday    🌕  Ps. No financial advice exists within this text, there is a lot of evidence to support people's claims that I am both mentally retarded and criminally insane
Do not tell Michael Burry he is the final boss before TSLA hits 1T market cap.
Hey Guys . The Hedgies that Took All the GME money Will Most Likely Use It Buy Xboxs and PS5s for the Sick Kids !
Sike ! THEY DEFINITELY WONT !  We actually Made Something of this Subs Integrity ! All the Damn good We Do as whole ! People know we have the Right Heart for an Investor. You know The hedgies will just use the profits to wage war against the poor and weak.  Look up ... dont look down. Win or loose!
I wrote poem about CNBC. ENJOY
I do not like CNBC,   Propaganda is not for me.   I will not watch it in a tree,   I will not watch it if it's free.   Even if they speak of weed,   I will not watch, that is my creed.   It's corporate media, can't you see?   I'd rather watch some Hill TV.     I don't like Fox or arrogant cocks,   ALL corporate media makes you grab your socks.   Red vs Blue is such a bore,   Rich vs poor is the real war.   You've been trained by the super rich,   That if I don't agree, I'm the GOP's bitch.   The truth is I'm non-partisan.   I back the people, not the pen.     CNBC protects the wealthy,   Owned by Comcast is not healthy.   Just last week they censored an interview,   Where Chamath defends poor people's view.   Why do you think Rupert Murdock,   Owns 30% of Vice you dumb cock?   I'm a progressive who has found alternative new sources,   You could to if you thought for yourself.  That last part didn't rhyme, but whatever.
Now that we have   million degens here it’s time to discuss the bull case for my favorite stock.... NIO
Chinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I’m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year.   My bull case....    EV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don’t think they’ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.  Introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.  That beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.  Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.   Deliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they’re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year’s 43,728 deliveries.   They’ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.  NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA.   Cameras also kill   Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X. It redefines the standards of autonomous driving sensing systems.  NIO BANK PRICE TARGETS  Morgan Stanley 80    Morgan 75  Deutsche 70  B of A 70  Goldman 59  Daiwa 100   We go to the moon with this one  Positions, 120 shares avg of 37  5 3/19/21 70c
Damn. What a fucked up world eh guys?
Doubled down on AMC. Holding the fucking line. Fuck the SEC and fuck the establishment
So when the price goes up like a rocket they stop us from buying. And when they go down they won’t let us short it. Yet in both instances hedge funds get to do both. Retail sorta like setup to fail?
FYI I’m a day trader so it is what it is. Go long on the way up and short on the way down. We just ride the big waves that the HFs make.  In this case my concern is with the brokers who are here to ‘protect’ retail yet all I see is preventing retail from making gains when the trends are very obvious, whereas big money has made heaps from this guaranteed short once they stopped retail from purchasing. Literally strapped retail down to the ground whilst pulling down our pants?
BRAUS is still rooting for $GME holders. Stay strong my friends. Next Tuesday will be an important milestone in our ongoing battle.
Who pulled out and are now stinking rich?
Anyone here care to admit that they have managed to severely change their life over the past month via the GameStop ride?  What did you buy at? What did you sell at? How much did you make?   What colour is your Ferrari?
Is this true? If so where the fuck is the sign up donation sheet and why don't I see this on top of WSB?
Take it with a grain of salt but Elon may be the seller of GME

Look after yourself this weekend! Relax and don't let the FUD bug you
We've all been watching with sweaty diamond hands all week, so make sure you take some time to recharge. Nothing is going to change over the weekend that you can't catch up on Monday morning, so unplug and go get some fresh air. GME ended today in the green, we're holding the line.     I'm sure there will be lots of FUD shitposting shills and bots coming to attack us in the coming days, so try your best not to let it get to you. We're in this together, and while we might not see this rocket ship take off next week, I'll keep holding on because I love this stock and I believe in GameStop!                I'm excited to see what happens in the following weeks, have a good weekend ya'll

I lost 600$ I could afford to lose.. and I’m sad
So I can’t even imagine how others are feeling... it just really sucks that as usual the SEC and everyone else fucks us over and we can’t do anything about it.
AMC is the way
They’re trying to make BB go up and keep GME in the green so everyone sells AMC and flocks to the next shiny object. Hedgies are feeling good about all of their positions except for AMC. Keep holding and buy more if you can, and soon we’ll all be at an AMC theatre watching a movie about how we all got rich. I can’t wait to see you apes there.
Now that we own GME, what can we do to change the company to a successful and revolutionary business model?

GME squeeze exit confusion
Sup tards. How are you planning to exit during the GME squeeze? A friend of mine YOLOed his life savings which is a third of his current annual income and just realized he cannot see a profitable limit sell with his brokerage because they only allow 50% increases on the current price.    1. How is he supposed to exit at his break even if he can't set a sale price high enough? Obviously he wanted profits but he can't even set a profitable limit sell on GME.    2. Why in the fuck can be not sell at whatever price he wants??   3. Are there any big boy brokers that let you set whatever limit order you want?   4. Why does it burn when I pee?    Positions: BB shares, more BB shares, and also a few BB shares.   Clarification since most of you can't read: He's trading with Schwab and I'm trading with Fidelity. He needs a price of a few hundred per share to break even buy can't set a limit order. Several of you don't understand a squeeze... It's a short moment. VW was VERY fast

Enlighten this retard.
What if everyone could trade stokes 24/7. What would be the result of that?
If we are holding 'cause YOLO, why can't the hedgies do the same?
Of course there's interest rates and what not but what if they double down so much that government decides to bail them out?
OH YES BOYS AND GIRLS
Plans for the weekend you dirty Apes?
For all of big lovers that know when to hold em' Here's how I'm   this goes way south and via real investigating we find fraud on the other end (which we already know) I'm thinking if I stay in my chances better of getting in on a good law suit if nothing else!

This sub needs to fucking move on
I’m sick of the way this sub has been behaving this past week since most of us got fucking gaped by GME.  It’s time we go back to normal, the pathetic posts stop and I want to see something other than GME shit being posted every minute.  Can somebody just YOLO $20k on some SPY FD’s or someone blow up their account on TSLA and we can all get back to normal?  It’s got pathetic lately and I’m tired of the shit that’s being posted about how rinsed out everyone is.
GME is rising! HOLD!
Hold the line you fucking apes
Shareholder meeting? When and how?

HOLDING TIL FOREVER
Daytraded through the low hundreds to increase my position, started with five shares and turned them into ten by the time we hit $328. Profits from AMC calls turned into ten more on TD. Fastened my seatbelt, expected liftoff, got cucked by RH instead. Cried. Jerked off into a crusty sock.  Got paid today and bought five more. Because I like the stock.  These shares will one day sell for no less than four figures a piece, whether by me or by my future grandchildren avenging me with the next squeeze in 2099. Never surrender.  PS. let's please stop setting stupid ass deadlines for when we think this is going to pop off. I've seen "TOMORROW IS DEFINITELY THE DAY" posted every single day since last Thursday. These posts have been correct 0/6 times. Stop it. Tomorrow (well, Monday) is NOT "definitely the day," and all you're doing is playing with people's expectations and emotions, while the weaker among us become more likely to turn into paper-handed scabs because they feel deceived and disheartened. This is either going to happen or it won't, and we don't know when exactly it will trigger. We don't actually fucking know anything, we can barely read. So keep it simple: just hold your damn shares until we're all either rich or dead. Be patient. Let go of your fear of bagholding. Become one with the bag. It's not that bad - I'm still carrying my ACB shares from fucking 2013. If you lose money here, it may be your first time, but it won't be your last unless you're a giant bitch. You'll live. And you'll make money on other trades. Maybe.  PSPS. Stop screaming "mArkEt mAniPuLaTioN" every time something happens that you don't understand, like AMC/GME trading as a basket (which is largely caused by a phenomenon called "apes buy the same stock, apes sell the same stock, algorithms catch on and daytrade accordingly"). You sound like the prehistoric retards who thought thunderstorms meant God was mad at us because somebody fucked a goat.  See you autists on the moon.

$  billion Ponzi scheme defrauded 17,000 investors, SEC says

Now that the sentiment about GME turned all negative, is it the right time to buy some GME?
Can we own the whole GME freefloat?
Let's say we all be like "ok for every pay-check from now on 10% go straight into doubling down on GME and then we diamond hand"  Could we actually "empty" the market? In the sense of owning everything that is not owned by institutional investors. What would happen? I mean at some point there would be no stocks left to buy and hence also no volume...Regardless of how low the short interest might be, if it's >0 that would be a problem for   guess what would happen is some back-room deal where some of the institutional investors would sell part of their shares?
BlackBerry Loss Porn and YOLO Double Down. The ballad of a retard 💯
It's time now
Allright you apes. It's time for some words.  some serious ones.  I know you say you can't read, but here it goes.  The last few weeks has been... lets say interesting.  Some of you mfers won it all, and some of you retards are left holding nothing but body bags.  Some made their first trade ever, got screwed real good, scared and pulled out of this world forever.  Others got bit by the bug and will try new moves to gamble away their fortune.  Some of you got out just in time with enough $ for a lifetime, and some will never recover.  That's how this game is. There is no mercy. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.  Some played it well, some got carried away.  WSB is all about lossporn, fantastic memes, ballsy hits and the occational riches, so all is good.  And a big fucking thank you to the mods!    But some of you apes, are just to good to be true.  Please,  buy GME, AMC and all other memestocks as much as you want, please spend  your entire savings, please borrow money from your mothers boyfriend, extend your mortgage, sell your dog, Toyota Corolla  or your mouth on the corner below a GMEposter on the side of the  road for more stocks. Good for you!  But we dont care.  And that is the point.  Its time to move shop.  Move  far away with your HoLDiN TiLL I'm Dead, BuY The DIps, short ladder,  screw HF, and the other new words you learned a week ago.  Please bring your rockets with you, shuw them up your asses and fly to the fucking moon where the god damn gorillas can fist you dry. Good for you!  As  far as WSB are concerned, this run is over. It was fun and it was the  greatest play there has ever been, but for us, it is over.  There are dedicated subs for you gaping assholes. I can suggest  .  You guys really seem to be into ropes.  You have become the Drunk uncle at thanksgiving rambling away,  It was fun for a while, a truly hilarious ride, but the party is over. Its time to go!  We get it, you love the stock, but now it is time to make sweet, sweet love to the stock somewhere else!  We want our sub back, and you are no longer invited unless you listen more, and talk less.  And u/deepfuckingvalue.. This has been the best play ever. You were right, you won, we love you for it.  But cmon man.. It's time to do the right thing.
Am I doing right?

It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers
Repost, because gaybears admins    Listen up retards: it is mathematically impossible for shorts to be covered by now. If it was possible to cover like that do you think short squeezes would EVER happen? It’s simple. Let’s use the worst possible numbers here. Jan 15 226% of the 51 million floating shares were shorted. 51 million x   =   million shares. Let’s say they shorted the shares at $5. They borrowed at least 576 million dollars worth of stock to do that. Over half a billion just to set up this short. Now people are saying they covered by shorting at 300, 400, 500. Ok, let’s say they covered at 300. You’re telling me Melvin was able to come up with 300 x   =   billion dollars loan to cover their massive fuck up? Even if they covered HALF the shorts at 100 per share we’re still talking about   BILLION US DOLLARS JUST TO COVER THEIR ORIGINAL FUCK UP and they would’ve had to fabricate THREE TIMES as many FAKE shares as they did in the first place. Remember 226% short over float? It would have to be 452% now to cover. Hold your fucking shares. Edit: I am not a financial advisor and this post does not constitute financial advice. I used my cell phone calculator to do this math. Edit 2: I know I shouldn’t be surprised you retards don’t understand simple math but let me try to explain this to you: if I short a stock at $5 and it goes to $100, I owe $95 to the lender. If I short again at $100 and it drops to $5, I made $95. My net gain is a big fat fucking ZERO. If I short again at $100 and it goes to $50 my net is 50-95= -$45 Not to mention the interest rate on that short position, which if I’m getting for less than inflation means the lender is paying me to borrow money. Please get your head out of your ass. if it were possible to cover a short squeeze then a short squeeze would never ever happen. The reason short squeezes happen is BECAUSE THEY CANT COVER. made by  u/salsawood , reposted cuz it needs to be seen!
$VISM – Visium Technologies, a new player in Cyber Security.
A personal DD for a company I truly believe in.     $VISM - Visium Technologies    It is no surprise to anyone when I say that Cyber Security is a high growth sector of the market, with a lot of young innovative technology. Visium Technologies has created the pioneering CyGraph, which is responsible for stopping the hacking attempt of SolarWinds in December. The hack has now been linked to Chinese hackers, as they were trying to obtain the SolarWinds platform and the sensitive information of SolarWinds clients. (   A month later, Visium Technologies has now attracted the attention of other potential new clients in the Cyber Security sector. In October, it announced the integration with AWS. Now in late January ( , Visium has announced the integration of joining platforms such as Splunk, Nessus, and NetFlow. This will allow Visium to attract new customers and seamlessly use their CyGraph functionality efficiently and more securely on new platforms.  And now the best part? Visium Technologies has just won a dismissal of the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed against the company. The Court ruled in Visium's favor, dismissing the involuntary bankruptcy petition and allowing Visium to file a motion with the Court seeking compensatory and punitive damages. In addition, Visium plans to file an affidavit of fees and costs incurred in connection with Visium's defense of the Involuntary Petition. (   NO MORE TOXIC DEBT! MORE CASH FLOW! MORE PLATFORMS! MORE ROOM TO RUN! And let me tell you, CyGraph is a pioneering technology and there is a good chance that big tech may buy this company out as well to add to their portfolio of products.   The CyGraph technology may have stopped the SolarWinds hack and now they are grabbing the attention of big corporations. Everything has been moving fast lately, but all is pointing in a positive direction for Visium Technologies $VISM. Their latest cryptic tweet was in binary, however, have no fear, as it decodes to “partnership, billion $$ company”. (   I will say that this is the beginning for Visium Technologies, they are also coming out with a new website this week, they are rebranding and reestablishing themselves as a secure and promising company in Cyber Security - hop on board and HOLD! It will be worth it.

Reposting gains for my fellow autists after I forgot to remove the logo from a different sub... keep holding with      my fellow crayon eaters!!!
My greatest fapp
Yes, I am still HOLDing!
Heard we are finally allowed to post GME gains. Not bad for 4 days of work.
CLOV Yolo. Was down almost 3k before the near close rally on Friday. Feeling good going forward.
Printer go BRRRRRRRRRR
Don't be smug - please friends
Guys, let's be honest, we entered uncharted territory. Yes we got fucked, who knows what happens next?? But please stop with the teacher OG/professional "i told you so" bulshit.. nobody knows a fucking thing here.. if on monday gme goes to 10,000 many "experts" will post that they knew and were right (with vw short charts)  If it goes to   the same shit! "experts" will post the same chart with the peak last Thursday.. ok some people sold and got rich, some held and got stuck, but none of us know a fucking thing!  The whole power of this shit is the momentum. It's gone global. For sure the system will cut us, and we have barely any chance.. but fuck it i got in just for this reason.   Full disclosure - i only have 3 shares, but now that it's so cheap i might buy more even if to just reduce my average ;) i mean if you bought 3 @150 then buying 10 more at 69 means i lost less :P   (This is retarded logic i know)
Update to my post about 68k to   million in 11 month since people asked me about my strategy
Hi All,  I got a lot of requests about my strategy of how I got 68k to   million. So I decided to share it publicly. Do not mimic my trades but just see how I go about things. Here is the screen shot of performance:        I benefited from one key point. When March dip happened my analysis pointed to a V-shape bounce back which I think will continue for the foreseeable future. Timing and taking big positions is important. I was short GameSt0p but immediately reversed my position when I saw trends changing. I went long and sold above $300.  What I usually do and have been doing for the past 11 month was using 80% common shares and 20% options strategy. When things got interesting I would even use synthetic shares (long calls/short puts). I do NOT use leverage which helps me sleep better at night.  I do almost 100% of my DD on options strategy and anything interesting that I cannot be bothered with I buy common. When I buy calls I go heavy. For example look at my calls for my latest DD:        In this current environment with stimulus pending it pays to be aggressive. Dance till music stops.  I like to publish my DDs because people can have a constructive discussion about it. For those of you who want to see the type of DD I do here is what I did for my current bet:  =========================  This company is a deep value company left for the dead, but analysts are slowly waking up to the idea. It’s a reopening play. It is the most similar stock/company to GameSt0p. It is very cheap. It’s new expansion in Europe is not priced in. Collectors are going nuts over Pops due to stay at home. Prices for Pops are increasing. It is becoming the new beanie baby fad. Downside is limited but the upside is massive.                Sales trends have reversed and going up:   It saw a sharp drop in demand about a year ago. Hence the price dropped in anticipation of low demand. But that trend was temporary as you can see in google trends graph demand is back. So now it’s a cheap deep value stock that is poised to make a comeback. It’s cheap with lots of upside potential. At all time high it was $  When it was selling less pops it was more expensive. Analysts haven’t realized that this company's sale trends have reversed. The price is suppressed due to being lumped into mall/retail business but this company pivoted hard to ecommerce.    Collectibles are back:   We saw the price of Pokemon cards, Silver, used games, and collectible s  go up during pandemic. The stock price for GameSt0p, Collectors Universe, et st has gone up. This company has all the same characteristics but because it’s a smaller company no one really woke up to its potential.    Ecommerce expansion in Europe:   European payment processors are reporting high transaction volume in regards to this company. This made me clue in to the increased demand driven by e-commerce. Most analysts are using USA data but the is missing a major part of the expansion plans that this company set in motion in 2019 and became fruitful in the second half of 2020.    Reopening stocks are poised to outperform  : If you are not interested in any other thesis about the company a simple sector rotation is the only reason many need to buy this retailer. Will the malls open in 3-4 month? Yes. So this will jump back up to its previous levels just by the virtue of that fact.    Great collaborations:   Need I say more? Disney has been killing it and their pops are produced by this company. The following is from their website:          New Fad of collecting Pops: (This is the new Beanie Babies)   A world record was set just recently for collecting Pops. You just have to do a simple YouuTube search. It's nuts. The most impressive is that   million people viewed the video. This brings attention to the hobby of collecting pops and people who were buying little have started buying more. Prices for out of production lots have started going up.    Clear uptick in demand.   These are trends on google shops: nuts!          Analysts are waking up to the trend:   This company had a sell/hold rating just last month. Look what’s happening. Now it has a Strong buy/Buy rating. The price is going to reflect this soon.          GameSt0p Similarities:   GameSt0p sells Pops and have full shelves dedicated to this. People are going to go to GameSt0p more and Pop sales will benefit from increased foot traffic. Buying this stock now is like buying GameSt0p when it was below $5. Profits are made before the run up starts. The run up on the stock is starting now. It has taken the first step of it’s spirit to new all time highs. This company is the most similar company and stock to GameSt0p.

23andMe to Merge with Virgin Group’s VG Acquisition Corp to Become Publicly-Traded Company
All of this market manipulation from HF's over the past week may have just been what digs their grave deeper ⛏
Most people keeping up with the GME & AMC charts this week will have noticed or seen posts about the blatant correlation between them on the graphs, I saw a few posts yesterday in particular.  At this point it's pretty clear that there's not much organic movement going on when you notice how the spikes and dips were almost moving in unison  If it's an orchestrated or algorithmic trend that's being injected as a scare tactic to increase the volume of panic sellers, it probably started out as a great little idea. Bravo hedgies! 👏 Probably treated themselves to a round of Don Perignon and a circle jerk after coming up with it.  But now that the week's shaken out and the prices are at a fairly low point compared to how the week started, it's probably time they realised how much of a short-sighted double edged sword they actually threw into the mix .  The psychological games would have no doubt worked on masses of paper handed bandwagon jumpers who bought 3 shares because their buddy gave them a Trading212 referral code and told them it was guaranteed money by Thursday.   But that being said, with the Yin & Yang of how the stock market is. The consequences of them artifically dropping the price and scaring all of the flies with 3-6 shares a piece, is that they're just attracting the hornets who've analysed technical data for months/years and have amassed a decent amount of money in their portfolio to throw at the cause.   The type of people that are holding at this point are the one's who see the bigger picture and are generally keeping an eye on volume/float etc.  And they're no doubt gonna want to capitalize on their chance to buy a dip and drop their average, not to mention the mentality shown across the board on this subreddit that says "Every share we buy is a big fuck you", to their chances of clawing back on this hefty bit of interest they're starting to accrue.  Happy Holding     (Not a financial advisor, just a guy chatting some speculative shit really)
This has been a long week, be prepared for what’s to come.
As a long-time member of the sub, I fucking   LOVE   loss porn. Like holy shit this last week has been amazing. But the accompanying stories have ruined my loss boner, so it’s time to address this.   There have been increasing posts of people pouring their life savings into GME and other meme stocks, hopping on the hype train hoping to make a buck. This is an absolutely terrible idea.   You should absolutely never invest money you cannot afford to lose.   And if you made some money, take out your initial investment and play with the gains, it’s free money after all.  Us OG’s want to see you make money. That’s what the sub is about. We want to see people take stupid fucking risks, but not lose their livelihood doing it. Please also remember to do your own DD. Or at the very least, click on some of the links people put in their DD and try and understand how they reached that conclusion.  Next, recognize what a  ”pump & dump”  scheme is. We’ve seen a lot of them come through this sub in the past, so we know what to watch out for. Many new folks however, aren’t familiar with any of that. If you see someone try to hype up a security, do research into it before you buy. If there’s no new news out or they’re a tiny company, absolutely   DO NOT   get involved. You will get burned.   Finally, it’s okay to take profits. You never lose when you’re up and cash out, you’re just securing those gains. It’s also okay to take the loss and reinvest in something else. There are no rules dictating you have to make that money back in that same stock.  And remember this saying:  ”Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.”   Don’t be a pig. Don’t get greedy.   Welcome to the casino. Stay a while. But remember to check out some other tables/machines. Don’t go all in on craps when you don’t know how to play craps.   TLDR: read the fucking post you shits  Edit: Positions because I’m a degenerate retard:  Cash from GME and TSLA gains. Currently a liquid portfolio until Monday.
Wallstreetbets - Hold
Why I'm holding
For starters I only have about 3 shares at this point at an avg of ~200. People seem to be attacking people still holding GME.  I get that there's a good chance of losing almost all of it.  I don't care.  Worst case scenario I lose most of my money and I get to laugh at myself for being a dumbass who invested in a meme that's a win.  Best case scenario it takes off to the moon and I get to laugh at you fucks and the hedge funds that's a mega win.  It's like y'all forgot that this sub is based on a ton of loss porn and a handful of huge payoffs from high risk plays.
addressing an elephant in the room
Hey, i was dumbish and bought GME @ $90-$200 a share. Believing the stock would logically go up after the weekend and that you wouldnt just have a giant sell off immediately on Monday. Obviously, this didnt happen. The people who claimed to hold were simply manipulating the market in their own right, so the stock price would go up and then they would mass sell. This is, legally, fine since they said its not financial advice and used a meme to hide it, but is also pretty much pump and dumping without outright being able to be charged with it. As the stock dropped, i sold, and you know what, it prevented me from being $700 in the hole because i saw the writing on the wall. Right now im only $200 in the hole now. There was no hedgefund short ladder attack or whatever. It was redditors selling, simple as that.   Truth is, the "diamond hands" thing was market manipulation, by reddit, to drive the price up of a stock so those that bought it cheaper can sell, they got their money, while most of you got your dick in your hand and the feeling that you "held the line". Looking back on it it was obvious this was gonna happen and although this a meme sub, i am not gonna feel bad if DFV gets dragged through the legal ringer since he encouraged so many people to hold while claiming it was gonna hurt hedgefunds and be a political thing when both of those were an absolute lie. He deserves whatever comes to him, unjustly or not.    Wallstreet i doubt even got hurt by this either. Yeah they lost $70 billion dollars in two days, but they still are gonna get bailed out by the government, and mark my words, the hedgefunds that were hurt by this arent gonna be hurting next year. They will be back because they are run by multi-billionaires with 40+ years of influence and experience in this stuff. It was a rough year, but not a bad one.   What my opinions are on GME. If gamestop becomes the next netflix for gaming, then thats the only way i can see any of us getting our money back. I hope for some of you that were tricked into buying GME during the hype that this happens so you can get your money back. I have 3 shares left i plan to hold in case this happens but im not holding my breath on it. It could be years tell that happens.   Long story short, we got played, hard, and now its time to just wait and see if the new people gamestop has on board is able to rocket the company back to over $200 a share. Its possible imo. Also what i was able to get out of this is to play the stock market smart and never bend into FOMO. Hedgefunds cant be hurt economically and this is proof. They rule the money.
Buy shares they said... $100k from $2,500. My life has been changed.
Be careful, danger ahead
Although GameStop has exposed a problematic system, and simultaneously empowered the proletariat, be careful.   You will see people pushing the next GME. You will see people pushing the next currency. You will see people pushing whatever it may be under the guise of “the people” against “hedge funds, billionaires, etc.”  The pump happening in GME will not happen often, very rarely at best. Yet, you will see people here, in your life, and all over social media pushing the next GME.   Please. Be careful, and look out for others. I know most of you can’t read, but maybe your wife’s boyfriend can read it out loud for you.   TLDR: GME success will lead to a lot of scams.
GME Yolo in my Roth IRA and Rollover IRA. 10 year growth chart. I❤️U WSB!
What's your number?
Why do all the alleged OG WSB members suddenly have advice for GME noobs, and why is it always to sell?
Something is going on here. A subreddit renown for “loss porn” and for roasting the hell out of anyone who asks for advice suddenly can’t stop itself from pushing GME holders to sell...  Why do you F CKING care- you didn’t care and refused to give advice up until 1-2 days ago.   I call bullshit- these posters are either bots or HF shills. Real WSB members don’t give a shit when or if another ape sells.
Let's go we're on insider! $GME to the mooooon!
Posted this in r/BNGO but they didn’t appreciate it   🤲
Saw the other fortunes, so had to get Chinese and see for myself. Rockets and stuff.
Hey Melvin, that's our secret...
You beautiful bastards
I just wanted to say, it's a fucking miracle that this stock is holding strong above $50, despite the most sophisticated, complex financial machinations and fuckery of stupid-rich hedge funds and Wall St institutions. Each and every one of you who is holding through this is a fuckin trooper, and your persistence is a testament to the human spirit and the ability of people to work together, against all odds, for something they believe in.  Even though I bought back in high, every day I see my new favorite stonk not go to $4 gives me hope - a hope that is worth far more than my losses.  I'm with you to the end, fellow

If we're all betting on GME, why don't we tell them how to succeed?
As a 30+ year old gamer I'm always looking for a deal and to purchase my next game. Every time I go to gamestop's website it's high prices and no value. So I often go to Ebay/Amazon to buy used since GME can't understand that foot traffic is the way to get customers to spend more.    So let's tell them what it would take for them to increase revenue.     1. Used games should be slightly more than Ebay / Amazon Used. Going to get the game you want off the shelf has value and none of us care about the extra $5-$10.  2. USED GAMES - why the fuck aren't you doing this? Partner with stadia and rent games. Tons of MMO's and stuff I never touch bc I hate buying games and regretting it.   3. DEALS - Selling 2 properly priced used games to get me in the store to pre-order a game is smart. SELL ME ON THE value.   4. Website - your website has been the same for years. I used to go to it for upcoming releases. Provide good lists and recommendations. TRAFFIC.  5. Incentivise Employee - I've never seen a salary worker "work hard" without an incentive. Give them things to do and reward them. Stop asking me for a warranty on my games. Know who did that? RADIOSHACK, look where they are.....  6. Imagine if gamestop was the only place that wasn't getting hit with bots when selling the PS5. Walmart is bc they don't care. but just imagine how much more business they get.   IDK those are 6 things i'd do if I was CEO. Hopefully the chewy guys can turn this ship around.
You can see my account transition when I started learning from this group.  tread lightly
GME gain porn from 4k initial investment 220k profit.
$BB Zack target price = 29USD  BBABY
Started my GME yolo in november with about 3k(account was at a loss at this point) and paper handed when GME hit 100. Mad that it could have been a couple hundred thousand like 2 days later, but its ok bc I got a full ride for 3k.
This will greatly improve my situation. Missed a few hundred thousand at the peak but got out when it went sideways.
Are you still holding....
Remember apes, you have to sell to make money.
Did I buy at the correct times? If yes, where are my money?
Here's some gain porn for you assholes. Bought for years on the dip but I diamond   handed   this bitch and it finally paid off.
GameStop should create a partnership with KFC to host a special version of the KFC console called "The Tendie Machine".
It prints money. Just picture it. It's almost like the KF Console was built for this moment, they just didn't realize it yet.  You walk into a GameStop and you ask the clerk, "Sir, I would like the Console which allows me to cook Chicken Tendies while I play vidya games".  "Oh ho, ho, another chicken lover I see. Well step right over here, we have just one Tendie Machine left."  Your eyes begin to water, you're almost crying.  "Hold on, let me grab it from the back" the GameStop employee says.  Your heart begins to beat faster and faster. Could it truly be that you will get a Tendie Machine today? Will you really be able to take it home and cook the chicken tenders that your mom bought you for your birthday? Will you finally get what your heart has secretly been desiring before you even  heard  of the Tendie Machine?  The GameStop Employee comes back. He's holding the last Tendie Machine in the entire store. Your eyes well up with tears. It's beautiful. It cooks chicken and plays videogames   at the same time  .   "Don't worry" he says, "it's all yours." You start to cry in the middle of the store, your dream is finally coming true. You pay for your Tendie Machine and take it home. Everyone in the store gives you a standing ovation. You see others who just arrived to claim a Tendie Machine with tears in their eyes as they know in their hearts the last Tendie Machine in the store is all yours. Your dream of cooking chicken while playing videogames at the same time has finally come true. Your life is finally complete.
Interesting tought my law professor had about the "news" about Silver, Plutonium and whatever stocks "WSB is squeezing".
He was giving a class about economics abroad (we're not from the US) and talked about the weird way stocks work abroad... as a reference point, in most other countries it seems the stocks have a fixated value that the company puts themselves, but it's backed up on the actual worth of the company and the stocks give the claim to the net earnings divied between the number of actions a company has.  When compared to the US, basically the stocks are worth, not on the real value, but the perceived value, making it a lot more... random... as people can that a company is "going to make a lot of money" and the stocks will increase in value, just because a lot of people are going to try to buy them, even if there is no real evidence they are actually gonna make a lot of money... EXCEPT NEWS ARTICLES CALLING IT OUT.  But that was not the real gist of the speech as, from what he said, the US system is showing that, not only their way of working is flawed, but, that everyone and anyone in a group, where they can amass a great deal of money, can actually take advantage of those flaws, and make as much money as those "Wolfs of Wallstreet" have been making for decades without any real repercussion.  That is very dangerous, as the elites were using that capital to increase their wealth, and attacking that system might make billions of dollars go away from the pockets of that .1%, to the rest of the population... And here is the real point of the news articles.  The point of effect of the news articles relating "Minerals" to this sub might not be related to confusing people in this sub to sell or buy random stocks, but to actually confuse people that don't really understand what reddit is, to regulate the way stocks can actually be bought or sold by making them believe they can actually change the value of anything and therefore, shouldn't be allowed to do so.  To explain this, let's say there is a new regulation and there is a single fee of... 1-5 dollars behind a personal process and a goverment building you have to visit to actually get the permit... How many people would actually get around the trouble of going to that building... and how many organizations of people would do the same altogether to start investing in stocks?  The number would decrease exponentially as, even if you can invest the money, not that many people will go trough the trouble of actually getting that permit and definitely it would make it harder for companies like Robin Hood or whatever, to work, since they would have to check that permit existing.  That would make the elites keep making billions every day, while making the regular people not be able to invest in large groups without a real issue like it's working right now.  Ok, for real, this is all conjecture and there might be some other random reason behind it and this was all said by a random guy of a foreign country so maybe he can be very mistaken so don't take it as anything more than that.
CNBC are not your friends, they’re trying to profit off of you
They may try to sell themselves as the network for financial news. This is all a load of dog shit. You’re the product and a lot of the time they’re biased for their own self agenda.  Take EVERYTHING you hear or read from them with a grain of salt, in fact ALWAYS look at the other side of what they’re spewing.  The scripted conversations they have between one another is all to make you take their side and view. They’re imbedded with institutions that are profiting off of retail investors. They’re sneaky fucks and it’s about time we all start boycotting whatever the fuck they have to say. The manipulation has to stop.  This whole GameStop situation just proved the narrative, it’s sad to think how many of their paying customers or viewers have been financially fucked over for their own gain.  TLDR: FUCK CNBC.
When to get out (an ask for the OGs)
I know this is “your” sub. I know that the GME gang infiltrated it and it sucks. I’m sorry. But I would love advice from some of you all whom have all made dire mistakes as well. I’m calling for those of you who weren’t in the GME shit. I had an average cost of $75 with about 74 shares. I saw it get to $150 and about sold. I saw it hit 250 - 350 - 450 etc and never sold until it bounced back to 90 and finally gave in. Y’all who are criticizing people who held but it honestly seemed like it was going to keep going and going and going. I’m not trying to mitigate my mistakes. I got greedy and it screwed me. What I’m asking is how do you go about selling? Because I also saw the stock dip from 440 to 129 to only bounce back up to 325, 15 hours later. Stop losses were also not an option because again the dip from 420 to 126 and back to 300s showed that wasn’t an option either.   I would have sold at 150 on Monday I know I would be kicking myself for not waiting until the 450 and I know now that I sold at 90 I didn’t originally sell at 150. Any clarity would be much appreciated.
We learn which publications speak truth
F u 2 Vice
Can we get a stickied GME bash thread?
Seems there are dozens upon dozens of people posting separate topics bashing GME and complaining about all the posts about it.   Ironic eh?    So lets give them one thread where they can put all their complaints in, since they are doing exactly the same as what they are complaining about.  Smooth brains be pretty shiny and buffed.      Fuck all ye 4chan weebs here trolling.  Media has forgotten about ye… boohoo :)
Take your fucking "Movement" elsewhere.
Newbs. We can tell you're newbs because you keep talking about unity and "The Movement". That shit doesn't exist here. We're here to make money, period. Go to r/GME if you are looking for someone to jerk you off about 1 specific ticker all night.  Also, we don't give a fuck about your $50 Yolo or your account transferring or any of this other total bullshit that is taking up the subreddit post history. Literally, we do not give a fuck. If you keep it up we will continue to troll you and tell you how fucking stupid you are.  Stop posting fucking irrelevant shit, read the rules, and use the right fucking flair. Goddamn, it's not that hard. This isn't a pump and dump movement and nobody here has "getting started" advice for you. Go to r/stocks and r/investing if you want someone to answer with any level of seriousness.  You Q-Anon Ape Conspiracy fucks are in the wrong place and you don't belong here. We will continue to berate you until you cry or get banned.  Edit to add: I keep getting accused of being paid for this. If some of y'all wanna pay me, DM me and lets arrange something LMAO. to you fucks saying I'm fake. here is a post that references me and my DD posts.     Edit 2: Read the room dumbasses. We will cut your cancer out of the subreddit before the weekend is over. Go shill somewhere else.  Edit 3: The anger and rage comes from the following: The pump and dump shit and misinformation has to go. for those of you interested in tendies. There are quality DD pieces and info that will make you money. I lurked for years. I want my quality content back so I can fuck some of you over for money. This shit hopefully ends this weekend and lets get the sub back to it's true purpose.  This isn't financial advice and is purely an opinion
Michael Burry retweeted a new theory on stocks, called " ". Can any autists figure out if this new theory suggests     ?

You can take our platforms and you can trash our stocks and scare the masses. But you’ll never take my fucking tendies. Thanks Popeyes  Hope strong my retardedd ape friends
came for the luls? bought GME and lost? its not over!!!
many of us believe that humor, and memes will, now,  forever be intertwined with investing. if that describes you, let me introduce you to the next hot memestock.   its GoPro. HEAR ME OUT. real investing geeks HATE gopro. they get REALLY ANNOYED when you talk about gopro. that's precisely why I decided to invest my life savings ... $250 into gopro just now.   2. yes there's a short squeeze to be squozen there. its not as big as gamestop. but our numbers are larger now. and it's not financial advice. its just... you know. ... us liking the stock or whatever.   3. yes 250$ isn't shit but it's not about me. its about the funniness of gopro being the next memestock.  and not being boojie. this is a rags to riches story.   its mooning soon. over at GoPro. not financial advice
Buy the dip if you bought high!
If you bought 10 shares at $300, then if you were to buy 10 more at $70 it would lower your overall cost to $185 then you just have to hit $185 to even back out! DOUBLE DOWN!
We have to protect the culture of this place. Will the real WSB please stand up?
Speak your minds. The sub will bend eventually. They have numbers, we have culture. Yeah, we were overwhelmed for a bit there, but it's time to take back this fucking sub. Comment, post, like it's business as usual. Laugh at idiots all day long. Tell them why they're wrong. Talk about other plays. Make jokes. Be yourself, WSB. Enough of this amateur hour. Bring back the quality DDs, the banter, the bear talk(it's more like reality at this point but you get it), the good fucking memes, everything, all of it.     We can do this if we are persistent. We can't call it quits. They're beginning to lose interest anyway, being down for so long will do that to you.
New Zom Product Explained for you Retards
Hello fellow retards. Ive seen some people confused or asking about the new ZOM product being released in march. I am a biomedical engineering student on a pre medicine track. I am in a military-medicine pipeline program, where when I graduated I will be a retarded medical student in our military. I have done lots of research with gastrointestinal assays (basically stomach/intestine test). So, I might be a retard, but I know what all this shit means.  So what the fuck is zom. Zomedical corp (ZOM) is a veterinarian pharmaceutical supply company. They are coming out with a product called TruForma. Truforma is a new way for veterinarians to test your dogs and cats for different cancers and diseases with out having to ship the results to a lab. Its a new platform where everything is done in-house (also known as the Point of Care). It uses something called BAW (bulk audio waves) that are really fucking precise. Speeds up treatment times, allows for vets to make a profit, less visits for pet owners. This product will hit the market mid-late march  Edit: I can’t believe I have to address this, but no I am no in any way affiliated with zomedica, nor do I want to be. I am just a premed student who’s really fucking retarded and joined this sub Reddit. If you have any questions specifically about the product I can do my best to explain but there’s 70 patents.   Edit 2: Jesus Christ guys If you want the specifics of the test I’ll gladly go over them. The test helps identify abnormal levels of adrenal and thyroid hormones which can help find different diseases and cancers of theses areas. It does this by having analytes like thyroxine, ash, t4, adrenaline, etc. bind to certain target molecules (these specific molecules have not been released to me) causing them to resonated at different frequencies when the BAW waves move through them. This allows the sensors (I do not have the knowledge of how these work) to pick them up separately from the other particles. You’re not cool by making me prove to you I’m a premed student by saying “I gotcha” and having me name a bunch of different hormones. I’m not pushing a fucking stock. I don’t care about it. I think it’s a cool product and I know it’s nice to have someone explain it to you since you all have explained things to me.   \ \ I am not a financial advisor, I am just a retard talking about science shit, explaining why people are buying ZOM. Please do not take anything I am saying as financial advise, I am just trying to say what the product is. This is no indication whether or not you should buy ZOM, that is your own decision. Also this is not saying that zom will moon or not. I have no idea what I’m talking about when I talk about stonks.\ \
The Market and Bots. An Enemy or a Friend ?
Hello to every retard in this sub, DONT BE SPOOKED BY THE TITLE. I've noticed the past few days a lot of stuff mentioned about bots and how they are affecting the market prices, To be specific many refer to them as illegal actions. However bots are not illegal in most of the world's markets . Lets Focus on GME and AMC which are the main reasons people are concerned. There are many things happening on both of these stocks for sure, despite that fact lets be cautious, when we mention the world illegal. Bots are being used by both sides. We are using them in order to buy our stocks and sell them at specific prices and so are ''they'' (''they'' referring to the big companies such as JPM) more or less to control the price in their favor. There have been many cases where there have been manipulation concerns, but somehow the ones that commit the acts leading to that, always have their asses covered. Its important to understand though, that the fact ,that the graphs look alike, may not be only due to manipulation, but due to the fact that the investors , are more or less the same. That means that the bots they are using directly or indirectly ,meaning the ones provided by companies such as one's that RH, Capital etc. are 'using', are making the calls at the same time frame due to the way they have been programmed to work. So now on to the companies that are using them in a different way. These companies such as Citadel and JPM are trading between one another in order to drive the price where they want since they both participate in the hedge-fund. I understand this causes a misconception, that this is illegal but it's not. Its unethical, since many people may be feared into changing their mind, and there have been many people trying to change the regulations. However since bots are the ones determining the price of a stock, it can ''be tricked into "believing" that the price is lower than the actual one". This has happened in the past and I will link an article which includes the instance which took place back in 2012 as far as I recall. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying nothing illegal is taking place, I just can't prove it. What I want you to pay attention to are the regulations these companies also have on bot trading or automated trading :    New definitions for algorithmic traders   Obligatory exchange controls for self-match prevention   Registration criteria for direct connectivity to US-based FCMs and exchanges   Pre-trade risk controls, including both cancellation systems and execution limits   Compulsory testing environments and algorithm source code stores for automated trading systems  I want to underline that the issue might be on the 3rd regulation, and that's where illegal activity might be taking place, if anyone finds proof about that we need to do something about this. In addition to the previously mentioned, SEC is not a regulator of automated trading so any issues must be forwarded to either one of these :      US National Futures Association   – Many USA day trading regulations stem from the NFA. Their aim to protect consumers while safeguarding the integrity of the markets.     US Commodity Futures Trading Commission   – This agency is independent of the US government and oversees all FX brokers in the US. This body actively prosecutes companies who engage in fraudulent activity in the forex market.     FINRA   – The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is a private corporation that conducts its activities as a self-regulated organization. They are primarily concerned with regulating stocks in the US. This is the body that imposes pattern day trading regulations.     Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)   – Created in 1974, this independent agency of the US government regulates futures and options markets. As detailed above, the CFTC also plays a role in algorithmic trading regulations.  I will include the link I mentioned bellow :
why I decided to "hold the line" over at GoPro instead of AMC
memestocks, like memes, only last 3 or more days, and as much as the older members of this group hate to admit that, the newer members understand memes better than they understand investing.   the old players don't know it yet, but they NEED us meme noobs. because we know what's funny.   GoPro, ladies and gentlemen, IS that next hot meme!         its a well known brand. the hedges are shorting it, and if you want to squeeze hedge juice, you need it to be funny enough to unite the group.   gopro is LOW. and holding strong.   i am holding that line with ease, my friends.   i don't know if it's illegal to push a stonk but... i just... fucking believe in this company, all of a sudden. and if I say "not financial advice" it makes everything nice and legal. that's what we learned. that's what this sub invented.   the meme is evolving. its like.. a whale's song. don't hate the innovators. this game is a about jumping on board a bandwagon the minute you see one. and jumping off the moment before it's no longer funny. something only meme enthusiasts understand.   GoPro- it's not financial advice
Was the rise in stock price intentional?
So I was a little confused with what occurred on Wednesday when the NYSE froze short trading. I do though understand that it was caused by the fact that GMEs price decreased by >10% tw days successively.   With that said, could today's rise have been to prevent that short selling lockout from happening again on Monday since today would have been the second day successively, right before their short interest data was to be turned in?   I'm retarded and don't understand everything.

Only lose if you don’t sell right? Out over 100k in   weeks but I’m still holding!
Can anyone explain to me why WeBull/Yahoo Finance briefly displayed this as AMC's price?

Lots of baby loss porn here. How bout a big one?
casino bets on GoPro cause only the freshest memestocks will make you money
first off. i am not here to give financial advice. this is a fucking casino. ever since GME tanked, people seem to have forgotten that.   now on to business. Go Pro is some dumb shit.  seriously, people strap these cameras onto their wingsuit and smash themselves into the side of a cliff. but thats what makes this such an attractive buy.   what have we learned? memes that are funny can also make you rich. if you don't get left holding the bag.   people wanna talk trash about pushing memestocks like that's not what this sub does. and just did. and made a bunch of people rich. and now they wanna go back to doing d. d. whatever tf that is.   all I know is that there's hedges to squeeze juice out of at gopro. and I love the stock. there's clearly no more hedges to fuck at GME or AMC but gopro is just as inept as a company. that's why the hedges are betting against them..... and US... the gopro holders. and people's who really believe that gopro is a funny meme.   don't let this sub become boring. yolo into something idiotic like me. gopro.   not financial advice.
I finally slept in late today... APE SPIRIT BLESSED MY VISION LAST NIGHT✨🙏
A case for GME long: Build-A-PC
I’m GME long, and if you must know why I’m confident in the company: it’s build a pc kiosks.   The console cycle has been getting longer and longer and it’s up to 8 years now. 4 years into the cycle (and that’s conservative l) budget gaming PCs at a price point of ~500 are going to be even with the current gen consoles, and outstrip them after that. Build-a-pc kiosks provide an outlet for console gamers to get into pc gaming. GameStop powerup can be used as a vehicle to provide incredible discounts to build-a-pc customers that hook them before they have a chance to look at steam.   The console gaming market is 10x the pc gaming market. If they convert 10% of console gamers they’ll have a larger proportion of the market than steam. And they have 8 years to do it. They have a partnership with Microsoft meaning users probably get a great discount on windows, which if you’ve ever built a budget gaming pc is 20% of the cost. They can set up their own relationships with hardware distributors to get around scalpers (incentive for people who build PCs) and to get bulk discounts on hardware. Combine that with a willingness to sell at a loss like consoles do, and they could probably be at console parity in a year if not right now.  They don’t need to compete with steam, that’s retarded. They’re competing with _consoles_. Hard now early into the cycle (which they profit immensely from I might add) but the longer and longer this cycle lasts the easier and easier it will be.   4 years from now, if they have captured just 10% of the console market, at its current value that’s a revenue of 6 billion, not even counting the revenue from actually building the damn PCs. If you count the growth of the gaming market, it’s probably closer to 10. If they don’t manage to retain a single customer with their existing model, and only manage to capture  10% of the console market, that gives them a share price of 150 at a P/S ratio of 1 (low end for S&P500). If RC does for pc gaming what he did for dog food, 10% is very conservative. He just threw down 170 million dollars to bet on it.  The one question, and the only question is: can Ryan fucking Cohen find a way to market pc gaming to console gamers 4 years into the console cycle when the next gen is still 4 years away.  So, it comes down to: do you think RC can do it? I do. So I’m GME long. If you don’t think he can, or if you think console gamers will still be fucking the cooling vents of their consoles with their micropeens 4 years from now, then you’re not.     bitches. See you at $500 in 4 years. HF: please keep shorting, I like my discounts.

Doing what I can with what I have in AMC. Just because it’s pretty doesn’t mean I’m below the bar for autism. Or above it?
Just watched gme hit 300 like 5 times
Maybe a stupid question but on my TDA gme just jumped from the 60s to 300 like 5 times for a few seconds. Just wondering what causes that?
100 shares bought at open would’ve clawed me out of my GME hole.
Too bad I’m still scarred - like a battered wife who just got out of an abusive relationship.  Discuss...  Obligatory     🏽

Does a hit piece on DFV and doesn’t even let you read the article for free
Well would you look at that, literally as soon as GME closes up the scare articles immediately begin to drop!

Disable margin on your account to stop the shorts from borrowing your shares
If you have margin enabled, the brokerage automatically lends your shares to the shorts. When this happens, the shorts use your own shares against you and you don’t even know it.   This needs to become a  . If you don’t borrow money from the brokerage to buy shares, if you don’t do short sales, and if you don’t trade options, you should disable the margin feature to prevent your brokerage from lending your shares to the shorts. When your shares are lent to the shorts, you don’t even know it happened because your account still shows those shares as if they were still held by the brokerage, whereas the shares are long gone. You can invest $100,000 into GME, but your brokerage will lend them all to your enemy to be used against your long interests.   We are spinning our wheels here trying to bring the price of $GME and $AMC back up. The more  of those shares we buy, the more of them are lent to the short sellers. This is insanity! Stop the shorts from being able to borrow your shares, people!
A psychological argument for why to hold $GME. ESPECIALLY NOW
This is not financial advice. I am not an advisor. Don't do what I say. This is an opinion. I'm literally eating crayons right now.        Red one tastes like cherries.   _________  Hey you, yeah you. You're retarded right? Listen close cause I'm gonna trigger a tendie grabbing autistic rage inside you.    First consider what it takes to become a financial titan. A massive hedge fund manager? These people are winners. They win, no matter what. They DO NOT LOSE like you paper handed soft bitches. They will do whatever it takes to win.   They have a history of winning, a pedigree of destruction in the markets if you will. Gains upon gains upon gains. Like your wife's, boyfriend.    Now for you to believe these HF's covered is for you to believe that these egomaniac financial chads who are banging all your wives while you close a night shift at wendy's, it's believing they accepted defeat. Do you really believe these HF's woke up last week and said.    "Oh shit, the retarded kids on the internet beat us. Time to cover and take a -5000% loss."   ABSOLUTELY NOT. These fuckers woke up and the winner inside them was awoken. They called meetings, did deals, and called their overseas mistresses and figured out how to wiggle and squirm out of this so that they can win. Because that is what they do. They win.   They win at all costs, that is how they got where they are.   To believe the HF's covered is to believe they accepted defeat by a bunch of autistic retards on the internet.    I know you're stupid, but you're not this stupid.   40 shares @~170
It’s not over yet
How come I am still down 80% after GME went up so much today?
I don't understand, GME is up 20% but it didn't even make a dent in the losses!
Why is there so much hate for Robinhood?
... When there are other sites that had restrictions as well like Webull, M1, Public, E-Trade, Interactive Brokers, Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Trading 212, EToro, Revolut?

Current DD on GME and the liquidity of the share
The retail investors have an impact. Otherwise, GME would already be back at $5. Stocks and buy & hold. Still the best DD. Nothing has changed since that perfect DD from weeks ago.  Shorts are not covered or only partially covered.  The GME DD from weeks ago already said that they will try everything to manipulate. Media, price and also your morale. Unfortunately, they have already managed especially the latter well. Yesterday, many of you have already given up.  But the fact is: If we continue, they will have to cover everything at some point.  You see huge swings up and down despite comparatively small volume? That is due to the low liquidity of GME shares. There are few shares available as most are holding. Therefore, small purchases / sales have a very strong impact on the price. Google liquidity in the stock market or read Gerd Kommer's books.  For example, someone in this sub has shown on the chart how a shortseller during a "ladder attack" was able to lower the price by over $100 with only 250 million capital. (Stoploss triggered etc.).  Today it was even more extreme. With a few thousand shares you could lift/press the price by 10% in no time.  All this speaks for the low liquidity and thus for the fact that the squeeze is still possible.  TL;DR: Buy & Hold. As said from the beginning.    Not a financial advisor   Edit: Example for low liquidity (So called ladder attack on WSB)
We are only "holding the line" until a new thing comes out for us to make memes out of.
People already be leaving for the where's waldo template lol
Heads up, memes are being blocked. Loss porn for your time.  🤲  Nightshift automods are cooler, jus sayin 🤭
Y’all need to chill
I’m new to this sub and have literally only been here for like a month. I am also holding gme at the moment. People like me need to stop fucking spamming posts about gme. We are newcomers so let’s try to not fucking ruin a community that isn’t ours.
The amount of bought accounts on WSB is baffling. We need a mass exodus.
Nearly every negative comment made in each post is an account that hasn’t been active in a year, or barely a 1k karma account.   We need to get ahead of these cucks before the weekend kicks into full swing.
Spent too much on GME puts that didn’t print. Maybe next week.
TYO: 7261 Mazda Motor Corp
First of all, this is not financial advice. And I'm a retard, don't listen to me.  I noticed  , and closed today with   So I tried to figure out why.  First of all, Mazda released a   yesterday. But this doesn't look like such a big deal to me. Their 3rd quarter was good, and they've revised their prospected sales revenue up by 50 million Yen. Nice, but I don't think this would get the stock to jump +18%.  Then the 2nd bit of news.  . This was announced today. So maybe this is the big news that made the stock jump?   Some months ago I read an article about the new Skyactive   engine that Mazda has in developement. I don't remember where I read it, and it doesn't matter because it's not an official source. So the following is merely a rumor: The new Skyactiv   engine was said to achieve up to a 56% energy conversion. That is huge, bacause the most efficient car engines on the market today do around 40%. So an amount of fuel that would get you 100 miles in a current efficient car would get you 140 miles with the new Mazda engine in developement. That's no small difference. Current Formula 1 engines convert about 50%. So if any of those numbers are true, or close to true, that new Skyactiv   engine will give a huge jump in fuel efficiency. And Mazda joining the eFuel alliance might just be showing their confidence in this new engine.  But the Mazda stock has already gone up, and the Tokyo stock market has already closed. Too late, too bad, I missed this jump in stock price. Or did I?   The Tokyo stock market closes at 3 PM local time. That's 07 AM Amsterdam time, or 01 AM New York. So the Japanese stock market has already closed for the weekend before Europe and America have had a chance to participate. And probably before we got the news. Maybe, just maybe, when the Japanese stock market opens monday morning (still Sunday for us), the participation of Europe and America might just give this stock another bump?  I don't know. I'm a retard and I'm just guessing. There is probably not going to be a 2nd bump on monday morning. But ... how big is the chance of Mazda's stock taking a dive next monday? I see no reason why Mazda's stock would dive. So it looks like it could be a safe bet. Maybe the stock gets a bump up, maybe it won't. But it doesn't look like it would go down, to me at least.  So I've put down a buy order.  This is still not financial advice! It's just the ramblings of yet another retard.   Please share your ideas and opinions about TYO: 7261 Mazda.
Enough is enough, I won't sell
This past week, I've been the recipient of such intense hate and harrassment, GME has gotten personal.  I'm not doing it for the money, I'm doing it for the movement.  I WON'T SELL

A new ERA
I did not partake in the gme fiasco. I was asleep at the wheel until it was too late. But it got me into trading. I also am noticing we are heading into a brand new era. Where the average Joe's have the power. Madoff calling over to cohen and they bought can drive up or down most companies let alone smaller ones.   How wild is it to think that the degens like myself with no trust fund could leave behind one for my grandkids due to what might happen here. What if I catch in on the next runner from pennies to $5?   Say what you want about people like tim sykes but that dude is building hospitals and schools in other countries. God bless him. It's nice to see funds being use for the greater good.   I will probably hit on a few trades and start strutting my shit. At that point I will wind up crashing my brokerage account to the point where I owe $100k. My wife will divorce me and I will move into a 1br and get a cat named Milo even though I'm allergic.   Thanks for ruining my life, wsb.
Nice.
Where can I find the link to the day trader noob parody video on here a few months ago?
Couple weeks ago there was video of this day trading noob who made $  on robinhood and he instantly turns into this wolf of Wall Street type character. He says “easy money” a few times and funniest line he says “so me and a couple boys are going to go in on a share of Amazon”. Does anyone have the link to this masterpiece lol?

The vast majority of $GME holders now likely have smooth brains and that puts it in a good position to go up
One thing no one seems to be mentioning is that the vast majority of GameStop shares are now owned by dumb apes. It is likely that during the peak and subsequent decline all smart sophisticated investors dropped all of their shares. What institutional investors would not have sold by now? Plus all of the smarter retail investors have taken their meager winnings and jumped ship. Every day the average IQ of a $GME shareholder is plummeting. Every day the average ape shareholder has a smoother and smoother brain. It is likely that a good chunk of the remaining reasonable investors jumped ship today. We are approaching a supercritical amount of mental illness. The day to day trading price isn't important. If most every single $GME holder refused to sell, the price would climb rapidly. The important thing to the short squeeze is that the average $GME shareholder has as smooth a brain as possible. We have already ditched all the investors with a big enough brain to ditch at 400 so our chance of getting to 1000 and triggering a true short squeeze is much much higher than it was before.  Disclaimer: I am dumb ape with very smooth brain. I am not expert.
Hedge funds will start panicking if we all continue holding. They will need to eventually cover their shorts and take a loss.
Still holding but I’m expecting to look like a genius soon, I was seeing sharp upward graphs in my sleep, that’s enough DD for a retard like me (this is not advice I’m not a financial advisor, I got a finance degree but that was the worst financial decision of my life
Closing Robinhood account? Recommend waiting until they post tax docs
I was planning on closing my Robinhood account but I am going to wait until they post the tax documents. It might be a hassle getting them once account is closed. On this note we should have a mega thread for  Robinhood account t closures!
I did it. Probably one of the highest % losses. Btw this is my small account and just yoloed for the memes.
A good day to be a fellow ape
Gains. Made almost 2x my account on this one.
Did I buy too high? Probably. Did I buy the wrong rocket? Most likely. Am I going to sell? Hell no! ($NOK)

Chamath, Cuban, & Others
GME has been awful interesting to watch. You guys grabbed my attention quite a while back. You guys kept my attention when GME was $20. I decided to place a couple of naked puts around $20, and was never assigned. When GME broke $40, I decided to buy out right shares, but I hedged at a lessor figure incase it fell. Too bad. I believe it was literally two days after placing that hedge, the stock sky rocketed. Once platforms shut it down, I had the choice of buying the hedge back for $10K but no chance I was going to do that as common logic told me the stock would fall as a result of the platforms choice of dealing with the situation.  What strikes me as the most interesting part of it all was the exponential spike and how some bid dollars out there are raving about you guys, talking about how you guys stick it to the man, yet those same individuals took massive profits. What do you guys call it, Paper Hands, yea? As far as I’m concerned, they left you guys high and dry as much as the platforms did. Just my opinion. You guys might correct me.  🏽‍♂️
Ending the day on a good note  🏽  it's not much but I'm still holding!
STILL HOLDING and.... I LOVE DISCOUNTED STOCK 😋
Robinhood gave me 2 free stocks
So i like them more than Gamestop, but Gamestop is headed in the right direction.
Mods plz do something about the state of this sub
This sub is in fucking omnishambles. Half the posts are either the same copy/pasted GME circlejerk garbage from people who don't even know what a fucking short position is and the other half is made up of the stupidest questions ranging from "iS iT a gOoD iDeA tO yEeT mY mCdOnALdS pAyChEk iNtO mEmE sTonKs" to "what GPU should I use to mine"  There's gotta be something you guys can do to nip this shit in the bud because hoooooly shit it's bad.

how the Gopro meme is different than Gamestop
GME sent a bad message, that diamond hands aren't the ones holding the bag. we can improve this model. evolve.   with the gopro meme. its all about selling for a profit. the way inflating bubbles in stocks that have been shorted by hedge funds should be. its not financial advice though. i honest to goodness believe in gopro. not cause I like cameras but because I like moons.   gopro. don't let this meme die and also get rich but also it's not financial advice. and this time we sell at the right time. not financial advice.
Explain to me how the shorts could not have covered yet
So the price of the stock has been sub $100 since Tuesday. We have a daily average volume of 80-90mm shares.   So with the price so low for many days and the daily volume about equal to the supposed amount of shorted shares - how is it not possible that most shorts have already covered their positions?
Robinhood Apes - Change your account to a cash account!!!
Not financial advice. But I learned a hard lesson on the types of accounts robinhood has. By default it is a margin account. 1. They can lend your shares. 2. They can sell your shares at a loss because their not yours. You rent the shares from them. I was like WTF!   One has to goto their account, downgrade to cash account.
LESSON TIME: GME was short-sale restricted today. Here's what that really means.
Special shoutout to /u/UnempRetardaddy, who inspired me to write up this explanation. Unfortunately, WSB investors have picked up some half-truths with limited information, and are reaching a whole bunch of incorrect conclusions which they're using to justify advice to other traders. BAD MONKEYS.     TL;DR:    Short attacks are real   Short ladder attacks are not   Any stock that falls 10% in one day (edit: compared to prior days close) is placed on a short-sale restriction for the remainder of that day and the next day   Short-sale restriction  doesn't  prevent short selling   It  does  effectively prevent short attacks   GME was short-sale restricted today, which is why no short attacks could take place to drive the price down. All downward price movement was caused by shareholders.     Let's go into detail:       Are Short Attacks real, and what are they?    Yes. A short attack is simply selling so many shares short that you drive the market price down due to oversupply vs demand.  This works the exact same way as if a shareholder was selling their actual shares, and not borrowed ones.   Let's imagine that a bunch of shares are all sold at market price at once. What happens?  Since they are sold at market price, they automatically meet the bid price offered by the highest bidder in the marketplace, then the next highest bidder, etc. As long as more shares are being sold than there are orders at the highest bid price, then the sale will continue to the next highest bid price, which drops the market price of the stock (market price simply being the last price the stock was sold at).  If the current highest bid is $100 a share for 100 shares,and the next highest bid on the books is for $99 a share at 1000   to drop the market price down $99, I need to sell 100 shares at market   if I want to drop the market price down past $99 (to whatever the next highest bid is), I need to sell 1100 shares.       What are the risks of launching a short attack?    When a hedge fund tries a short attack, they are taking a risk that there is more demand to buy shares at current market price than there is supply of shares they are willing to short sell.  If Melvin tries to short 1 million shares at $100 market price, but 10M shares worth of market price buy orders are immediately placed because people see the price dropping and want to buy the dip, then due to high demand vs supply the share price will go  above  $100, and now Melvin is in the red on their short position. For a real world example of this happening, see TSLA throughout 2020.       What makes a short attack successful?      Low trading volume - if there aren't a lot of buy orders on the books, there are fewer orders to meet at each price point, and fewer shares need to be sold to drive the price down. For example: Thurs 1/28, when brokerages halted buying and artificially reduced demand    Large supply of shortable shares - there are only so many shares for a company, and only so many of those that shareholders are willing to lend out for short selling. A short seller needs a large enough supply to (temporarily)  overwhelm demand. For example: Despite shorts available for GME being at or near 0, MMs were (legally) allowed to 'naked short', creating artificial supply which allowed hedge funds to short sell at the $500 peak on Thurs (and yes, its as unfair as it sounds)    Paper-handed bitches - This is the real key to success. If actual shareholders notice the price dropping and decide to sell as well, it creates a compounding effect, where supply increases even more, and price drops even more, and even more people decide to sell. This can also be caused by price drops triggering stop orders, as well as triggering margin calls by driving accounts below margin maintenance.   Psychological manipulation - This is a corollary to the previous point. If every shareholder had a sense that the price drop was only due to a short attack, they'd probably hold. But if they see news stories saying shorters closed their positions, that everyone is switching to buying silver, that brokers are halting buying and no one can help drive the price up... well, it makes it a lot easier to justify selling.  For the greatest example of all four of these elements at work, see GME between last Thursday and this Monday, between the brokerage restrictions (and the Market Maker margin reqs behind them), the media misinformation  , the incredible abuse of naked shorting in the name of 'market liquidity', and the reality of the bull side being a lot of retail investors without deep pockets who overextended at high prices and didn't have enough collective reserves to buy the dips, so they ended up selling.       Are Short      Ladder      Attacks real?    The claim behind a short ladder attack is similar to the Short Attack described above, with the added flavoring that colluding hedge funds are just selling back and forth to each other. This is impossible.  Note, per above, that  short attacks  are quite real. What makes a short ladder attack nonsense is the belief that hedge funds can direct who their sell orders go to, or that it's possible to constantly bid a price down in an open market place, where anyone can place a market 'buy' order and prevent the price from dropping till their order is met.  The closest we came to this notion was last Thursday, where the big players just straight up cheated and shut down much of the buy side of the market, so that, in effect, hedge funds may very well have just been short selling to each other. But that is more due to the environment created by those (hopefully unique) events.  Shoutout to /u/EmptySet2 for his further breakdown of why it's not a real thing, here:        What is the Short Sale Rule (aka 'Alternative Uptick Rule' aka 'Rule 201' aka 'Short-Sale Restriction')?    There's a bit of history here, with some changes to the rules over time. I'll talk about most recent version of this restriction, which was implemented in 2010:  1. If any security falls more than 10% within a single trading day, it triggers the 'Alternative Uptick Rule' for the remainder of that day, and for the duration of the next trading day. 2. While that rule is in place, short selling is only permitted if the price of the security is above the current national best bid (aka on the uptick).  This is required to be enforced by the system as a whole. For this rule to be broken, everyone would have to be in on it, from brokers to clearing entities to market makers. It would be a big fucking deal.  Source:    Source for monkeys:         How does this stop a short attack?    Recall from earlier that a short attack is just selling a bunch of shares at market price, driving the price down as you meet each next highest bid.  Well, quite simply, while GME is short-sale restricted, short sellers  cannot  sell their shorted shares to the current highest bidder. They have to set their own ask price above that highest bid price, and wait for a buyer to meet it.  What does this mean? It means that on a day like today, a short attack by its very nature isn't permitted to happen.  All short selling can do on a day like today is suppress the price from going up . If the current share price is $60, a hedgie could short sell 10 million shares at an ask of $ , and thus the price wouldn't go past that until all 10 mil are bought out.       What does this mean about current stay of play of GME?    Broadly put, for the past week there have been alternating days of massive short attacks, followed by lulls or even upward price movement during the short-sale restricted days.  Yesterday there was a whole lot of shorting and/or shareholders exiting positions, driving the price down more than 10%. Today, we saw a relatively stable price as only shareholders could sell at market price.  Put 2 and 2 together and take a wild guess what's coming Monday.  (Edit: a short attack. That's what's coming. Or maybe it isn't, it's just going to be possible again. Just be aware of the possibility that wasnt there today. )       Position: 1000 shares and 5 calls

Actual picture of me buying GME today.
What a year it was
What in the actual fuck is up with UGRO
Grow INC.   Basically a supplier for all those growing weed indoors.   I bought it at $13 yesterday and it rocketed to $100 before settling at $70.   Sold a batch at $74 and $98.   Does anyone know why this happened?
I get the feeling that GME become a battlefield for warring hedgefunds
to GME Holders and Fighters
I hold 259shares of GME at 90$. I was very angry as the GME dropped more and more, I was counting the losses and struggling to sell everything.  However, all the time I was thinking about all of you who bought shares for 100,150,300,400 ... I've been on WSB recently, but I liked all APES, HOLD, DIAMOND HANDS AND ROCKETS.  I realized that I cannot leave you stuck buying too much money.  Everyone wanted to earn and everyone wanted to help GME grow and grow.  Fukin RH and hedges have dealt a big blow to us, but we cannot give up.  We have to save our brothers and sisters, we have to keep and buy as much as we can.  We, as a WSB group, must support and save ourselves as much as possible.  So I made the decision to buy every falling or rising stock as much as possible to see GME again for $ 400 +, so that each of you wouldn't lose your life savings.  I would also like someone like ELON to help us achieve our goal, save our ideas and the goal for which this group was created.  To win against manipulation, crisis and fraud.  To free the market and the people stuck in it.    APES together, HOLD FTW, DIAMOND HANDS AND FUKIN MORE ROCKETS                       BUYING MORE SHARES IF I CAN, HOLD AND WAIT FOR THE OUR WIN.
I'm now getting these ads all over my google feed... Ive owned a bunch of SLV for over 8 years and haven't had an ad since... So don't buy into it! GME, BB, AMC to the moon!

Yeah I ain’t selling anytime soon
Poke holes in this for me.
I found an options strategy that caught my eye, and while I've been doing this for a few years now, Idk why I haven't thought of something like this but anyway my goal here is to find any undiscovered flaws. Maybe my crayons have just kicked in idk but it sounds solid to me anyway.   so this is the plan:  1) Monitor Blue chip stonks that slowly rise on the steady (like PG, JNJ, JPM, MMM, HD, GS, etc.). Wait for dip.  2) Buy calls 5% otm that expire two-three months out (unless delta is < .2 or .3 or theta/prem is crazy) (i also have been monitoring technicals to make sure I buy at the right time.)  3) close position with one month remaining to exp. if you're happy with 10 Ds.   The idea is, you pay a few hundo for a juicy 'tract on a juicy stock, let that MF premium get rock hard jacked and dip when you've made 50-100% depending on how steady it rose. Now the reason im writing this post..   I've played with this strat on TOS's "ondemand" platform and I've seem amazing results, I've yet to try it out for realsies. I've had amazing results so far (about 60% ave return over about 100 attempts) but im not sure if im just experiencing an anomaly, if the market has just been bullish or what? Can anyone think of any obvious flaws in this strategy before i play a losing game? Thanks in advance and fuck you too.
There are people here saying the squeeze happened last Wednesday.....
Tell me why they are wrong
That the IRS is offering Tax Relief and Forgiveness for anyone struggling with tax debt.
This is for anyone who has accumulated tax debt from the hardships we faced from covid. The IRS is offering multiple programs to help people consolidate their tax debt. You can compromise with them to settle with a small sum or be put on a payment plan. They have multiple options.  A lot of people don't know about this and it doesn't require you to disclose any of your bank/finance information. This can help some of you autists.

This is a lot of fun. 🦧  🏻
TLDR; buy/hold AMC/GME and lick my balls if you think this isn’t a casino.   This is my first post to wsb but I have had a fucking blast over the last week with all the ups and downs. I’ve known from the beginning that this is a casino and have been buying amc and gme in small amounts every day for the past two weeks.   A lot of people are down on all of this bitching about all the money they’ve lost but obviously they don’t know how to gamble.   This is better than playing poker or blackjack or baccarat at the casino but there are a Fuck load of people who don’t see how much this market is all about gambling smart.   Don’t gamble more money than you can afford to lose. Pretty obvious one if you’ve ever seen any idiot bottomed out at the chino maxing out their credit cards and getting pissed off at every dude who makes a bad play at the table because they think it is the one reason they lost all their money.   Anyway I’m having a fucking good time and can’t wait to get to the moon.

Hey im one of those teens reeled in by the recent rise of attention the stock market is getting and i wanna get deeper into this stuff wether that's for the better or worse.   However literally every post has all these abbreviations and terminology that a beginner like me wouldn't understand.   I'd prefer to not waste peoples time asking dumb or every level questions so if there's any guides or books or sites I can use to interpret what you're all saying and maybe contribute myself, that'd be hugely appreciated.

Short message to Wall street Hedge funds
To the Wall street Hedge funds: I know you are still heavily shorted and you want something I have, the GME stocks. There is no way I am selling, I can earn back the money I so far lost, you can keep on manipulating the market but you still have to pay me a fair price for the stocks.  Hopefully other WSB followers that owns GME feels the same way
We are too inexperienced to trade! We need our rights taken away
Funds vs. Funds over GME. The real reason I am holding
A HUMBLE & AUTISTICALLY RETARDED PROPOSITION...
I’ve mostly lurked here for about half a year, but only recently noticed that there appears that grumbling among the unwashed masses of WSB concerning “returning to normal” and “returning to the pre-GME roots of WSB” or even “forgetting about GME”.  None of the above are possible. First, the vast majority of us here are not normal, and the forum was never normal. Second & third, it is impossible to go back to the pre-GME days of WSB for obvious reasons - too much attention, shills, bots and other fuckers (yea I know many fantastic retards have joined the ranks). Also, War has changed us all. While some have deserted the front lines, most are still fighting bravely (including myself...holding my 25 shares bought at $262 LOL and waiting for payday to buy some more).  However, it may be more realistic to, if other stocks are purchased while this thing is ongoing, to promoting the buying of equal or greater amounts of GME - that is, if a retard is unwilling or unable to commit to GME 100%. This may, in the long run, boost moral and calm people psychologically. This whole thing may take weeks to run its course and we need as many soldiers as we can muster up for the cause.  What are your   this post is even read by others...  PS I’m a retarded financial advisor but the above is not financial advice.

I love the stock and we’ll spend forever together!   In all seriousness though. Gamestop has infinite potential with recent events. Do you think many many years from now the stock could be worth even more than $400?

GME short covering mechanism
Many are claiming its impossible shorts have covered. I offer a humble counter argument for consideration. I don't want to ruin the fun, but just drive some grounded discussion. Apologies in advance if I'm missing something.     So presumably most short positions were using shares loaned out by the biggest holders - Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard etc. Collectively they own \~78M shares out of the 70M total float (      Ok so squeeze happens, shorts panic etc. They buy as much as they can off the open market, and start returning shares to these institutions. So let's say these 78M shares were bought on open market and drove the peak price on 1/28. In the three days leading up to this peak, trading volume was \~150M shares per day.     Here's the important part. As shorts were covering off of the open market, shares were returning to the institutions who had lent them out. So the institutions can sell these fresh shares directly to the shorts. This is in the institutions' interest because of massively inflated prices. So the institutions sell their shares to the shorts, returning shares to the open market. This is what allows the shorts to cover while a bunch of apes with diamond hands sling poo around the internet. If correct, we might see institutional ownership of GME has decreased substantially, but these numbers aren't public until 3/31 - and institutions have plenty of time to repurchase their shares before then.     Tldr: 111% institutional ownership meant most short covering returned shares to institutions, who could sell those shares again to help shorts cover. 111% x 2 = 222% short covering this way, with only the first 111% of short shares bought on the open market prior to the peak.
YOU SEEING THIS???
Is it reasonable to expect GME to hit $500 this week?
I DCAd down a little and am down to a cost basis of 400 a share.  After analysis, I reached a   $500 estimate  , but I've been hearing   1k at minimum   recently. Am I being too conservative?    This was calculated using the V Shaped Recovery Thesis, Fibonacci Sequences, RSI, and other techncial indicators.

GME: Holding through the squeeze is just as important as holding through the dip
Alright, fools. You diamond handed apes have done a hell of a job holding so far. I'm proud to have lost my ass with you. Denying Melvin his shares is hard but satisfying work.  But the next few weeks is the real test.  Any gamma or short squeeze has only one relief valve: more shares. You marvelous bastards didn't sell at $400, and you didn't sell at $50... and if/when the squeeze hits, you have earned your tendies. The thing is - selling early is a BAD THING™ and means you are letting Melvin, Groucho, and Harpo off cheap.  When the green tsunami rolls into town, think long and hard about when you want to sell. Think about all the shady big money interests along the way who have worked against you, likely colluded, and are ready to rob you of your future for the chance to maintain the status quo (them on top).  Think long and hard about how much pain they caused each of us. Not just this week, but our entire lives.  How long will you hold?  \      --  I know fuck all about finance and stonks. Not financial advice, IANAL, GME
No matter what HF and paper hands tell you: 68$ is still so fcking high that Moon scenario remains live.

Why the SEC Short Interest report on the 9th is already priced in and we will see the squeeze next week
Everyone is waiting for the   report coming out on February 9th. However, that report will not be accurate according to current situation.    Reason: 1: The settlement date for that report was on January 29th. Meaning, anything from the Feb 1 til now is not included.   So what happened leading up to the 29th? On the 28th, Robinhood and other brokers restricted purchasing of shares. Collusion or not, it sent the price plumetting to sub 200. Situation was great for the shorts to cover their positions a bit and make their report kosher. Price recovered a bit on Friday after some purchasing was allowed. However, by this time, the shorts already fixed their books to not get in trouble.   2: Now that the 29th has come and gone and the hedgies had something to hand over to the SEC, they started doubling down. Starting from Monday, EVERYONE noticed the aggressive short ladder attack and more shorts were being done.   3: Prices have plunged from $325 close on the 29th to $  by close Thursday 2/4. The reason why they can do whatever they want is that the next settlement date for the report is on Friday 2/12. So the real important date is the 12th.     What to expect   1: The report on the 9th will be good to please the SEC. Everything will point to 0 manipulation. Media and Jimmy Chill will be jerking off to the news and telling your wife to leave you.   2a: The report on the 9th will cause FUD and drive prices lower because everyone and the media will think that you apes are retarded. Shorts will cover and get out of their positions easily as price has dipped way back down.     2b: If 2a does not happen and if everyone has diamond hands, expect 2/10 - 2/12 where the short squeeze happens. Why those dates? Because the next settlement date for the SEC report is the 12th and the hedgies have to make their report whole like how your wife's boyfriend makes her.    tl:dr GME will       if you   . Short interest report on the 9th will seem legit.  Obligatory not financial advice. I just like the stock.

WSB is for Options Trading not stocks.
Since everyone is new here, let me explain .   This is a place to discuss option contracts on various stocks .   Please research what that is first.   We are not here to teach you.  If you are interested in stocks : try r/investing r/stocks r/GME   Again - WSB was NEVER about buying stocks.  And it was never about politics either .   We don’t mind new members, but the core of the GME “movement” is becoming an irrational cult- driving away any semblance of intelligent discussion , DD, and what have you .     Please be respectful of the long history WSB allowed you to depart off of .   We like LOTS of stocks here .
ITS OKAY TO ASK QUESTIONS
I see lots of ppl asking questions just trying to learn about the ropes and are met with “you shouldn’t be into investing if you don’t know this stuff.” To some degree yes you are right but belittling a fellow ape in their mission for more bananas is bad for the community! It’s amazing seeing ppl like me, young investors getting into at this age and are just curious and want to learn. The market is ours and we get to flood our money into the ideas we believe in and it’s important that we share this info and educate the next retail investor.
Support from New Zealand :D

Moving on from these meme stocks...
Can we start talking about important things? Instead of this army of retards typing "hold" and "buy more" in caps, fuck them off and let's start getting back to normal. This trend is dead and buried. No one with half a brain cell will touch these stocks with a 10 ft pole
Hey WSB, can we have do some more AMA's? The faster we can understand what power we will have as retail investors, the better. I think we would all benefit from putting these together.
I know this is WSB, but let's face the music here. We've become #55 on the list of largest subreddits, many people here may already be professionals in their field, and I think it would be worth our time as a community to hold weekly events as a way to keep people interested in the stock markets. For many of us, myself included, this is our first experience purchasing our own stocks and building our own portfolios. Some of us may still be leery or polarized from recent events, but I think it's important for the future of our economy that we, (and you, the professionals) have a vested interest in each-other and a working friendship. The curtain is definitely there, but I think even from a common person standpoint, we all would stand to benefit from listening to you guys. Things like stock analysis, reading charts and how to understand them, even basic indicators would be really cool to discuss with a professional.  We all have a voice here, and upon reading (and posting) it's come to my attention that we need to take our opportunity and make something of it, rather than be a, "mob of retards to fear". If we take the initiative to learn, we will be respected and when we catch something like this in the future, it will be a done deal. No, "Reddit children said this" or the like, fighting media every step of the way.  In no way do I think this would change the state of the sub. In fact, I argue that WSB would have more loss porn than ever before. Studies show that those who believe they are educated are more likely to take risks. Frankly, losses just come with the territory here on r/wallstreetbets, and I would hope the moderators see this as a chance to build something beyond their wildest dreams of , "just a movie deal". It's easy to see the loss porn, but often times people have reasoning for how they got there. Even having something as simple as requiring an explanation on a post of loss porn would be nice, even if it's literally, "I just felt like it was going up".  People didn't show up to lose money on purpose, but it's nice to have a nugget of feedback if these people are honest with themselves enough to post their losses, or a way to look at previous AMA's and see something like, " What did so and so say about bear crosses again?"  Sorry for this  long winded post, but if this concept already exists elsewhere, I'd really like to be a part of it. Retail investors are the future and I want to be as educated as possible via books, interviews, and what I can find online.  Some people are pointing out that I may have made a mistake in how I interpreted the information I posted earlier today that is now trending here, but I want to be clear that I \ want\  to learn. If you saw it as a shitpost, and you're a financial professional, I'd like to hear you out.  Thanks.
We all know GameStock is going to tank, isn’t it an easier play to just buy puts?
GameStop’s fundamental price is $25 (and that’s generous). Do a bit of reading it’s very easy to get into.   Only reason you guys won’t is cause you can’t afford it, but just find another stock then  🏻‍♂️. GME is tanking Monday opening.
Wall Street Bets is Ruined
And all you new fuckers ruined it. Now all it is is an echo chamber of stupid shit that has already passed, and you’re clearly living in regret. We had a great community before this month. Ban me, downvote me, I don’t really care anymore. This is the end of WSB.   RIP.
You shouldn't be happy that other people are losing money
Seriously, what's with the GME and AMC hate. We're all tryna make some money with our own plays.  Our losses aren't your business    WE LIKE THE STOCK
Thank you guys for fighting this battle and inspiring change.
I’ve been poor most of my life. I’ve always heard about getting into the stock market and making more money off it. When I have had money, I’ve had no faith in myself so I’ve never entered the market. That changed on January 8th of this year. I finally entered the market through Robinhood with my measly $700.   Things started out slow up until this past week. I live in Northern California and there was a massive snowstorm here that knocked out power on Monday. This week, I have power through a generator. But I missed one of the biggest moments in   history being without power from Monday until Saturday. I don’t own AMC nor GME stock but I do hold Express that was also affected by what RH did.  I was so excited when I first got power to see that my portfolio nearly doubled in that time. And express was a big part of that. I then felt sadness seeing my value drop when I heard what was going on. I wanted to sell my stock. But then Reddit suggested this sub to me and I read up on what’s been going on and you all have inspired me to hold on to my measly 20 shares. I will not let them get away with market manipulation. I will not be controlled. Many of you out there will never be mentioned by your usernames in the media or anything like that. Many of you are worth 5-8+ digits. But let me tell you. You inspire us poor people to stand with you and to fight for what’s right. Remember, you guys are fighting a war. Only this war isn’t being fought with bullets and blood, but with paper and electricity. You all have tons of poor people out there rooting for you guys. Stick it to the fat cats. You all have a once in a lifetime chance to go down in history for changing not just the USA, but the world right now. Don’t surrender. Remember that this battle is for the future. For your kids, friends, cousins, nieces, nephews, and so on.  I haven’t been here that long but you guys have given me a reason to care and a cause to stand for.   🏿  🏿
Robinhood is trash, leave it if you can. But I finally opened it again after 3 years to get my free stock out of it. Thanks dbags
My retards version of DD based on my complete lack of knowledge. But, here it is.
Preface: I am retarded monke that doesn't give financial advice, but I wanted to get a review of how my pathology is either regular retarded or mega retarded.  [These charts] (  (yes, it's robinhood. yes, I have opened another brokerage for after this GME stuff is over.) show a 1 day and 1 week spread with a 10 day MA.   Now, from my really, REALLY, #REALLY, limited knowledge these are clear flag patterns narrowing into the MA, and pairing that with the tapered volume should indicate a break out right?   Yes, I understand that it could break under the MA but with the momentum this morning and AH I lean towards it breaking over.  How retarded is this humble monke?  Edit: Failed to mention the hard resistance @ $60 all day as well.
Its coming... maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday and you'll remember it for the rest of your life!
Looks like they are actually making a movie about us, where's my royalty check?

PSEC      Earnings Play 2/9 360k GME shares   YOLO
This genius fucking company bought 360k GME ( ) shares at an average of   No telling if they sold or held until 2/9, but if you’re depressed about bagholding GME and need another autistic play, this is the one for you.    Positions: 7c 2/19 x41 ///////// and I will load up on 8c 5/21           ❤️
Dude was a broker up until a week ago

If anyone is losing faith and thinks that the squeeze has been squire, food for thought: The fact that there’s been consistent aftermarket trading of GME proves the hedges are up to some shit.
I’m not a market analyst so I don’t have any fancy graphs or articles. I don’t know any of this technical shit you guys keep posting.   What I DO know is that before this whole thing happened, GME barely had any after market activity, if  at all . But ever since January when all you retards and autists united, activity has been going crazy but the volume is relatively low (I understand that much). That’s enough to tell me that there’s some shady shit happening. And where there’s shady shit, there’s money. I want my money.   Squeeze these fuckers.   20 GME bought @ $34   This is not financial advice   Edit: forgot the obligatory      🔗💪🏾   🏾🍆  🏾
My wife just asked me if I needed moisturizer?

My best stock pick:Ocugen. Grabbed a bag at $.60 in August and this week it's been launching into the sky. Still has a long way to go up too in my opinion! I wish I had bought 10x more than I did though!
Anyone else take longer showers while you wait for GME to go up?

$FUBO Sports Streaming and Gambling Wrapped Up in One
Hello there fellow degenerates. I know everyone still has their panties in a bunch over $GME and $AMC, but shockingly there are other stocks in the market. Before you rip off my head, just hear me out.    $FUBO.    Fubo TV is a streaming television service that allows you to cut the cord when it comes to cable. It provides over 250+ television channels and boasts perhaps one of the largest collections of sports channels. Apes from all over can watch their favorites from football to cricket (I hear that's popular with some crayon eaters abroad).  Now, you're probably thinking, "So what? There are tons of streaming platforms out there, the market is dominated by established providers like Netflix and   now I'm bored because I have the attention span of a goldfish." Well boys and girls, the thing that makes this turd so shiny is that last month   $FUBO   just bought Vigtory - a sportsbook platform - which they plan to use to establish a revenue stream. When I heard they were creating another way for a retard like myself to risk money, I felt a tiny tingle in my flesh flavored bean bag. Other sports betting companies like Penn Gaming and Draftkings are trading higher comparatively, and streaming platforms like ROKU are on another planet. This thing has room for growth.  Now the icing on the cake is that this news didn't come out until AFTER a large number of individuals decided to short   $FUBO   stock. It has a 73% short interest float since January 15th. Short interest volume was 31% today. So this stock does have the potential for a bit of the ole squeeeeeze. But that shouldn't be the reason you retards invest in this company. By   $FUBO   combining sports streaming and online gambling they could become leaders in the sports betting arena.   $FUBO   predicts a full launch of the platform before the end of 2021.  TLDR:   $FUBO   will be the new crack for sports betting addicts.  This is not financial advice, this retard just likes this stock.

If AMC hits $6 I’ll buy more
I think it’s a good value play, but in the short term I could see it falling a little further. Not to shit on anybody’s parade, but if you are holding, don’t worry, AMC will probably hit $12-$15 in the next 3-6 months.

GameStop shares halt slide after Robinhood lifts trading curbs
Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)
Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.  I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.       Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?    As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.        Per S3, Short Interest was   as of the 27th and   as of the 28th. The net SI is (    This means the net short position reduced by   shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.  Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum,   retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.  To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $  If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened   more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining   positions would be opened between $350 and $480.  This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add   short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming   no covering   was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price   went up.    Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only   in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover   positions, and   of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only   could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that   covering would drive the price up, not down.    Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of   in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add   at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.  So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only   at exorbitant costs.  This likely didn't happen, for several reasons.   First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.  Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase.   Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time.   Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was   hard to borrow.     What is more likely is the   inverse   of the above, which would mean shorts covered   shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold   shares at an average of $250, before further covering   at an average of $250.   Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.    That means hedge funds   are not   kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.    Part 2: What About Last Friday?    Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.        Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is   how could it be remotely possible?    S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.     So on Friday there was 50M in volume.   of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (  SI as of the 28th)+(  shares sold short) =   In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as   =   shares.   How do you cover   shares when there is only 50M volume and   of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?      There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most,   shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (  = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.    Furthermore I want to draw attention to   other times shares were covered   and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.    that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an >100% increase.  They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally   exponential growth   in the share price   despite no change in SI  . But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?  There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of >31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price?     Part 3: How Could They Do It?       Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered   when they have not    There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.  Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also   did not   shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position.   They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.  TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

Please help me sell my GME
I have been holding GME through this whole thing after buying exactly at the peak and now when I go in to sell it, for some reason the only option I have is to add more money to my account and BUY MORE GME.   When I show other people my phone, they tell me to press some button that says something other than "BUY", but I can't read and so all I know how to do is put more and more buy orders out there.  My   🤲 and my smooth brain don't seem to understand how this "selling" thing is supposed to work.
Why is SPCE (Virgin Galactic) not part of the conversation?
I've been following along the GME/AMC saga for a little while, and I don't understand why SPCE hasn't been part of the conversation.  \-It had 71% short interest according to MarketBeat as of Jan 15th  \-Cathie Wood approves, and another catalyst is (potentially) being added to ARKX in a few months  \-Bagholding SPCE is much less risky than bagholding GME or AMC in my opinion.  SPCE is a growth company with potential to be worth $100's per share if/when they are successful.  \-It has a number of positive catalysts on the way, including a test flight as early as a 2/13.  The stock ran pretty hard into the last test flight.  I anticipate it running hard into each test flight and positive milestone, including the flight of Sir Richard Branson in a few months.  What am I missing?

It’s over and people are still toying with the emotions of the newbies as if there’s still gonna be a huge price take off to this whole thing.   Please just stop pretending. You’re playing with inexperienced peoples emotions and legitimately hurting them by stringing them along.   I thought the big rise was gonna be yesterday and now people are saying February 9th. Just stop. It’s not happening. Stop toying with people and moving the goalposts every few days. It’s not healthy and needs to be addressed.    170 AMC   1 GME

I’m not holding a ton just genuinely curious what people’s thoughts are. I jumped in this with the knowledge I’m probably gonna lose it all but wanted to support the movement.
So this brings me to my question, is their like a deadline where they will forced to liquidate their shorts and buy the stock at whatever price we set or do you think they will fork over billions more to extend the position out longer?
Dick said what now?
From the article:   "From a short seller’s perspective, I was spooked a week-and-a-half ago to short any small caps because I was worried WallStreetBets could squeeze me on it,” Dick said. “I’m not spooked anymore; I kind of went back to normal trading, so I can say I think the WallStreetBets influence is not as strong as it was last week.”     Where are those apes riding the dip? Where are those diamond hands? ✊   Idk whats happening. Monkey want banana.
We see you comrades, up on $346 Mountain!
Are you in GME because you like the stock or because you want a squeeze?
Seriously, retards, half the posts say "I like the stock" and the other half are financial crimes trying to trigger a squeeze. If you wanted a squeeze, GME went from 20 to 487 in under three weeks. If you wanted a quick buck, it's gone. If you like the stock, stop trying to manipulate the market.

Moving on to better stonks... $AMD back on the menu, boys.
Hi retards,   I've had my laughs from the GME pump and dump, trying to get back to making money now. Anyone still chanting diamond hands while they cry, fully clothed, in their parent's master bath tub while licking a photo a KFC bucket is officially excluded from this discussion.   I have been on $AMD since around mid-2017, when the Ryzen hype was getting started (who the fuck you think started it). Let me tell you why now is actually a decent time to get involved:   1. You're retarded, and financial strategy isn't your strength the way eating a jar of mayonnaise is.  2. AMD has done everything they ever said they were going to do, including snatching the crown for single threaded performance from Intel.  3. AMD's desktop, server, and mobile CPUs are industry leading products that are being sold above the MSRP for the first time in my memory.  4. AMD's GPU lineup is more scarce than even NVIDIA's stuff (Performance in gaming is a wash) 5. AMD is currently valued \~$100 billion 6. AMD became profitable about a year ago, and wall street has been waiting for the other shoe to drop, but LISA FUCKING SU NEVER TAKES HER SHOES OFF. Pretty sure mama su bae sleeps in a pantsuit.   So, it seems like you missed out, huh? Feeling a little down and out? Your wife's boyfriend ate all your popsicles?  Good news. Gospel, really. AMD's run is only half over. The other players in the space ($NVDA and $INTC) are both losing market share to AMD at a rapid rate. The thing is, due to legacy machines existing, and old people thinking computers run on ravioli, almost none of the market has made a CPU purchase until NOW.   I'm talking about schools, corporations, POS, all that shit. Server farms. Government offices. They're all still running legacy Intel chips from 2012. Anyway, just saying that the growth (astonishing rate of 45% YoY for like 3 years) that $AMD has seen in revenue and EPS - that growth - will continue, and might actually accelerate this quarter, definitely going to pump after Q2 ER.   Just look at the market cap of Intel ($260 billion last I gave a flying fuck). AMD is a more valuable company long term. They make better products. They attract better talent. They are smarter about who they work with (they were the first major partner of TSMC, now APPLE and INTEL are trying to squeeze in and suck the tit). They love enthusiasts. They are agile.   And they are at the tippity top of the mountain, but they're only half way up. Think about it.   I won't stop betting on AMD until their market cap is AT LEAST 50% of INTC. should be around $120 per share. My position is almost all shares right now, with a lonely $95 call expiring 3/12. Gonna give him some friends pretty soon.      Good luck out there, and for fuck's sake stop circle jerking to your GME loss porn. It's sad.
Diversify Motherfuckers! Head to the casino every weekend and drink heavy, but make sure you can pay your bills too.
I’m down   on my gambling money but I’m up on my boring mid and large cap retirement account.   There is absolutely nothing wrong with buying and hold a company for years if you think the long term profits are there.   There is absolutely nothing wrong with using a wad of cash on a rumor and a dream to see if you can get mad gainz and collect those tendies.   It’s probably not a great idea to jump headlong off a cliff without a parachute, and you’re ostensibly doing the same thing if you go 100% in on GME, or anything else, because you’re easily swayed by internet peer pressure. FOMO is not a good reason to set your bill paying money on fire.  Edit: On advice, changed YOLO to Gambling Money because the nature of this strategy is inherently contrasting with a true YOLO.

Sunpower (SPWR) set to have a 150% run up!  🙏🏼☀️🔌🚨🚨🚨
Let’s talk about SUNPOWER (SPWR)  I have been looking for a long term hold and I think I found it: Sunpower (SPWR)  Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the  hugely growing industry. Thank old Joe!  Just google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.  Sunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. It also has had a good consolidation in the last week so no is a great time to buy.  What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing.   SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.  If you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.  this is not investment advice. It is my opinion. I am not a financial advisor.
Why AMC Stock Jumped Again Friday   The Motley Fool
I deliver Ubereats. This guy must have diamond hands
To the moon
Here is my loss. I went full retard and bought in at 235. Buying back in at 61 cause fuck it
THE FUNDS FLOODED THIS PAGE WITH BOTS. READ FOR PROOF.
I see tons of comments on bulls posts about how dumb they are. But these aren’t our boys at WSB. You know why. Cuz if they were. I would see many more options outs being purchased cuz that’s what a TRUEEEEE Wallstreet better would do.   They just come. Fill ur mind up with negativity. And leave. Every. Fucking. Time. Which is proof. That these hedgefunds are SHITTTING bricks.  FUCK  THEM.   IM HOLDING AND NEVER SELLING. I refuse to assist them closing positions. Absolutely refuse it.
Looking at the last 5 days it looks like the paper hands are running out, hitting the bedrock of autism and monkæ. While not being an financial advisor (brain perfectly smooth and round), am including my prediction.
Why are all posts relating to a GME investor meeting/reverse stock split being removed?
Pretty much the question in the title, I've seen 3 that have now been removed and I think it is important that it's something people who own GME should be aware of
When you lose...
Glad the trading limits are lifted for AMC&GME, but after the past two weeks I don’t have any more capital with which I can buy more shares. Can’t sell at a %70 loss either. I’m sure I’m not the only one in this boat. It IS easy to have    at this point if that’s any consolation haha
If a majority of potential buyers are in the same boat as me, what does that mean for AMC and GME next week on?
What do you guys think about yolo investing in an airline that's lost 99% of its value in the last year and is facing bankruptcy?
Why can’t AMC opening a streaming website ? They hold rights to steaming a lot

THIS MAN HAS DIAMOND HANDS> BILL FCKI G GURLEY
That is assuming you’re holding your AMC. Like a   holding a kid who fell in your enclosure!
Stay   STRONG
They're trying to push the price down, and we keep buying the dips. I keep setting Limit Buys at certain levels, so that when they push it down, I just keep buying more; the lower it goes, the more I buy. If we all keep buying, this helps stabilizes the drop, and continues to reduce the amount of available stock.      Obviously not advice, I'm just a retard.           🤲
AMC: Dalian Wanda Just Converted Their ~50MM Class B Shares to Class A Shares Today, May Increase Float and Decrease Short Interest Significantly
AMC just announced that a large investor, Dalian Wanda, just   converted their \~50MM Class B Shares to Class A Shares today  . It's unclear what Wanda will be doing with those shares, but if they decide to sell them (   similar to Silver Lake converting its AMC Notes to Equity and selling into the market   ), they could increase the AMC float by \~50MM shares and decrease short interest significantly.    If Wanda sells its shares into the market, the short interest would decrease and so the chances of a big short squeeze would also decrease   (because now there are \~50MM more shares that everyone needs to buy to get back to the same place we were before this announcement).   Here is the AMC announcement:    I also made a post recently about why I think true AMC short interest is only \~10-15%, and this conversion of Wanda Class B to Class A shares was one of my points:
Question - "Theoretically" what would roughly be the volume of shares HFs would need to trade between themselves for a ladder attack that would have the effect we have seen on GME? And if you could expand what numbers would/wouldn't attract the SEC? Thanks
GME Conspiracy
I have no proof I'm just saying this because its fun to think about  What if hedge funds bought large portions of GME to fuel this rally as well as hedge against their shorts and then incite a selloff using the trading restrictions, media, etc. so their shorts could cover. Maybe we don't have as large of an influence as we think we do and instead we just played right into the hands of the hedge funds.  I have no proof of this so don't attack my stupidity in the comments.
An Australian’s view on the last few weeks of GME.
[Have] 100 shares of GME [Want] $40,000
# GME's fair value is 450 a share, the price I paid for it originally    I am selling at a discounted price, $400 to recoup losses and return the money I borrowed from my mom      If we do this privately, melbots 🤖🤖🤖 wont be able to STEAL my shares and they will go even further underwater      Lowball offers = ignore    HOLD THE LINE
Hold the shares if you can
The momentum would have created a high energy at GME and AMC to know that they have got free publicity and public support. At the moment any sensible management will try to capitalize on it. It would not be surprising to see GME take the netflix route and go from being a BM store to more of an online presence. The new hiring show that they might be headed in that direction. All they need is to ride the wave we have created for them.  I work in Strategy and Innovation and I am sure game stop has similar people on their roles who are trying to figure out how to capitalize the new found fame. I can think of atleast 10 different things they can do, they probably have plenty more ideas.  The way GME can thank us is, by proving that they are a $1000 company and not the $0 the HF thought.   If GME launches some kind of subscription or online service, I will be one of the first to sign up.   Ride the 🌊. Unity in strength
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR NEXT WEEK GUYS?
The rockets are taking off
This is not financial advice.  This may come as a shock to you, but 2 weeks ago WSB was all in on a multitude of stocks.   Stocks that have real value, and aren’t just a squeeze play.  All this GME hype put those stocks on deep sale this week.   Owning more than GME isn’t a sin. Make some money on the side.
Leaving Robinhood after This is over!!
Hey guys just wanted to have a discussion on why I should leave Robinhood. I know it has been bashed these past few weeks and I have experienced it's restrictions. So I know the reasons for it's hate now. However I would like to know any more reasons why it's horrible and which app you think I should use. I was thinking maybe fidelity or some other app that seems more professional / not limiting.
What will happen if $GME$ does a reverse stock split? Real answers only please.
I see a lot of talk about this going on, but know that a lot of people are unclear on exactly what that means. With that being said, what do you think would happen to GME? Thanks!
Ha ha watching you eat yourselves alive
Why not devolving your losses to something like cancer research?
Instead of "sticking it to the man".  The sum of all the unrealized losses here easily is in the millions, and I'm sure legit researchers could use some funds.  This seems to be a much safer play to do good instead of hoping that some hedge funds are "bleeding" through interest rates.  Heck, with your $100 you could feed a baby in a 3rd world country for months instead of seeing some red pixels on the screen.  Just a honest suggestion, if you want to keep diamond hands ok, but maybe you did not think about this opportunity
This community inspired me to make some wood art. No paper hands!
PLEASE READ: I work at Fidelity Investments in the Margin Department... Horror Stories of the shitshow that is Robinhood, told by someone who is reviewing & processing your ACATs - PART 1
So, I'll start this by saying: Yes, if you look at my post history I mostly just openly troll you autists.  I've made fun of the conspiracy theories (mostly bc 99% of you don't understand the importance of market integrity) and I've openly mocked the simps who joined WSB so they could be "join the revolution".  I'm OG WSB... this sub was about autistic YOLO plays that made no sense, coming up w/ retarded strategies, bragging about tendies, and telling people to long $ROPE when they blew their accounts up and cried about it.  I'm the WSB equivalent of an old guy yelling at you kids to get off my lawn.     \ \ \ \ \ HOWEVER\ \ \ \ \ ,    the things I've seen over the past week as Fidelity is forced to restrict brand new accounts (bc of RH), reject perfectly good ACATs  (bc of RH), and watch as clients are shocked to hear the   actual   rules behind trading that the ENTIRE REST OF THE INDUSTRY USES are   100% lawsuit worthy.      In the interest of time, ease of reading, and the desire to answer questions I will break these up into multiple parts.     Feel free to AMA in comments and I will respond as best I can. Assuming people find this helpful, part 2 will be coming soon.  If this post just ends up deleted by the bot then /shrug at least I posted it.   \                                      -    Part #1: Securities purchased using margin in RH accounts when the client had cash available to cover the position.  So, RH is one of the only (the only?) firm where you just get margin as a part of opening your account.  Now, when I say margin I mean the thing that allows you to buy more stonks than you have funds in the account.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_    Please note:   Having margin  ON  an account is different than having a  MARGIN ACCOUNT.  A margin account simply means that you have the ability to have the proceeds available for trade immediately after placing a sale.  Not all securities are marginable, which is why some securities (like GME the other week) required that you wait for the trade to settle before those funds became available to trade again).  Having margin  ON  an account, means your brokerage firm is giving you a line of credit through which you can purchase more stonks than you have the cash to cover (they charge you interest for this and this is how you can be margin called simply by holding stonks that you paid for).  Having margin  ON  an account ALSO means that, unless you sold the stonk within a few days of the initial purchase, you pay interest for using their money to buy/hold said stonk.  FIDELITY ACCOUNTS REQUIRE THAT YOU FILL OUT A MARGIN AGREEMENT in order to have margin ON your account.  As such, when a security that has been purchased on margin hits an account without margin (like a freshly opened Fidelity account) the new account is restricted, the ACAT potentially rejected, and/or the client immediately is faced with a margin call at Fidelity.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_    WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU:   Check your RH accounts!  If your positions show as being held in margin when you have cash available there is a good chance that Robinhood (rather than using the available cash to facilitate your securities purchase) instead purchased using the margin on the account.  In many cases, we are seeing clients who are looking back and realizing they've been being charged margin interest without realizing it.  THIS IS NOT LEGAL.  If you have the cash available in your account to purchase a security, unless you specifically state otherwise, Robinhood is required to use your available cash FIRST.    IS THIS HAPPENING TO EVERYONE?   No.  It seems to be sporadic but roughly 50% of the over 1m new accounts that Fidelity opened last week have had margin related restrictions slapped on them because of this issue.  However, one person we talked to had to close his bank account (at one of the big three banks) because, after transferring his Robinhood account, they started DEBITING HIS BANK ACCOUNT because they claimed he owed them margin interest.    MORALE OF THIS STORY: Review your account and make sure that your stonks and options (when applicable) are being held IN CASH if you know you had the cash available to purchase the position.    Review how much cash is in your RH account.  If RH says you are holding positions in margin and yet you have cash available to cover those positions then IMMEDIATELY contact Robinhood and insist that your positions be converted to CASH POSITIONS.  This does not require you to sell your positions.  Review your statements, trade confirmations, and account to see if you have been charged margin interest.  If you used $10k in cash to buy $  in GME stock, then you   should not   see any margin interest charges.  If you used $10k in cash + $5k in margin buying power to buy $15k of GME stock, then seeing interest charges makes sense.  Assuming people find this helpful, part 2 will be coming soon.

Mad respect to DFV   to all GME      out there.
Honestly I have high respect for DFV. He has more balls than I do. That being said, my advice here is for all the rest of the  GME      . Basically you have an end point coming soon, so you need to plan accordingly. I'm not gonna tell you what to do. But just to give you a heads up.  DFV has half of his position in GME as call options expiring in April.   DFV has two options. 1. Sell those call options before expiration. 2 Rollover said options.   If he chooses one, which will most likely happen anywhere from now till March he'll be good. If he waits for April, those options will be destroyed by time decay and be worthless at expiration. So if I had to guess mid March if he chooses to act the latest.   Now if he chooses number two, that would be fucking insane. Why would you rollover, which will guarantee you losing money when you are so far ahead.  What you do with this info/thoughts is up to you, just plan accordingly.   Good luck
Definitive Guide: New Members and the Market
So you jumped in on $GME and now you wanna try your hand at the market. Alright, I’ll help so you don’t start bitching in the comments about someone’s DD after 4 days of trading.     Rule #1:   The first one’s always free. Did you jump in brand-new and win big on GME? Good for you, but realize, you don’t know shit about shit, and you should be grateful that you made that money, now don’t go losing it on a fucking BioTech YOLO because you think you understand how the market works. Ignorant confidence will get you burnt in the long-run.     Rule #2:   LEARN HOW TO DO YOUR OWN DD, JESUS CHRIST. Did “pussyslayer420” just make a 6 paragraph post about $ROPE? Did you read it and understand maybe 20% of the words and throw money in because the comments enforced that mentality? Well, let’s fucking hope not, but if you did, good job, you’re at least retarded and belong here. Now, watch like the first 7 minutes of  , and if you ever see anyone shit talk Investopedia, tell them to fuck off.     Rule #3:   How you should be using your money. Who am I to tell you how you should use your own money? Well I can tell you this,    I’m not a licensed professional and none of this is financial advice, just my personal opinion.    Now that I’m not legally fucked for giving my opinion, let’s continue.   Only use money that you’re okay with losing. Pay your bills, buy groceries, and take care of your debt.   Next, taking profits isn’t a sin. See the BIG FUCKING GME GAIN POSTS? These are the people who saw money laying there for free and said “Fuck it, I’ll take that money.”, and don’t get me wrong, GME hasn’t been squoze it seems, so she still has the potential to rocket into the stratosphere. But, there’s nothing wrong with leaving a trade when you’re comfortable with a gain/loss. You can even sell enough to get your initial investment back and let the rest ride if you’re bullish. But at the same time, I got murdered when I started trading because I was a paper-handed bitch. Go with like, stone hands, difficult to break, but realistically they can be broken and sometimes need to be broken.     Rule #4:   DONT FOMO YOU RETARD! If you say “Am I too late to the party?” You probably are. You MIGHT not be, but, you probably are. Best chances if you’re FOMO’ing to get in, ride the wave for a slight while longer, sell out, and then never look back. Which leads us into “NEVER LOOKING BACK”. It’s just a bad idea most of the time, I bought into $NIO at $18, and sold at $21. I was happy with my gains at the time, and I didn’t look back; until it was inevitable and I saw people talking about the rocket, yeah it was fucking depressing. That’s why I recommend you don’t look back, it’ll just make you angry, or depressed, or feel like a retard (that’s where I was), and it’ll fuck up your mood. If you made money, don’t look back, keep it schmoovin. Now finally.     Rule #5:   Treat it like a business. If you’re trading as a fun hobby, you likely won’t have the motivation or commitment needed to keep learning and stay strong when you go tits up. Don’t get me wrong, is the market fun? Sometimes, fuck yeah it’s fun, other times, it’ll make you walk down the street yelling into a flip phone like some angry wallstreeter whose wife hasn’t fucked him since the new boyfriend moved in. It CAN be a hobby, but it’s a hobby that requires a lot of time and effort to be put into it and you don’t get a weekly paycheck. It’s more like a shitty business, you’ve got taxes, expenses, losses, risk, stress, uncertainty; but with enough time and dedication to LEARN and CONTINUE LEARNING (the market changes everyday) it will start to become a PROFITABLE business.   For those of you who plan on staying, this sub is a great time. We insult each other, we waste money for the meme, and we love coming here everyday.   But just understand, when you see someone say something like “It can’t go tits up!” or “DD too long, I’m buying” just know, it’s likely a joke, or just a bad idea.  Anyway nerds, thanks for coming to my TED talk.
New people (and experienced).. GME is over. Don’t lose your money
GME stock was crazy. Honestly, you could’ve gotten very rich and made huge gains.. BEFORE it spiked. Everyone who was smart enough has cashed out their big returns, and if they’re holding anything at all, it’s a few shares they don’t mind losing.  It was really interesting to see the kind of power a community like this is capable of. That being said, this “fight” is pretty much done. Sure, billionaires lost money, but I’m pretty sure it dropped low enough for them to recover a lot of it. (Which is why robinhood is letting you buy more, duh.)  So, don’t get me wrong, I can’t predict the future... but I can give you some sound advice: if you’re going to dump all your life savings into GME right now, expecting to get rich.. you’re playing a VERY risky game, and you might lose it all. Want to hold GME? Sure, do it. But do it with money you don’t mind losing.  Edit: Just to be clear. I’m not hating on GME or telling anyone what to do. It’s friendly advice. I feel like some people didn’t bother reading past the title so I’ll  TLDR:  If you want to buy GME, be smart about it. Will it go up, down? Who knows. All we know is it’s definitely not the same situation it was 2 weeks ago, so the chances of you losing your investment are higher.. therefore, “invest”, don’t “dump all your money and hope for the best”.
Buisness is boomin’
MarketWatch Thinks We Should Give Up and Cash Out
# They want us to give up. They want us to cash out.   # Are we going to listen to these 'experts?' Hell no! We are   retarded ape strong!                    GameStop’s meteoric gains have almost entirely disappeared — here’s advice for those who didn’t get out in time.    “For those that still have money left in the market, there is no reason to ride this all the way into the dirt.   Cash in what you have left, learn from this lesson, and come back to the market better prepared next time  ."

The attack on memestock investors is getting ridiculous
Hey you, corporate shill, bot, Melvin intern, failed boomer experiment or whatever you are. You act like GME and AMC investors are ending the world.   Last week people have donated more than all of you combined would ever give to anyone. They have donated to children's hospitals, to charities, to the less fortunate, to GME employees and many more that i can't recall.   We are betting on turning our lives around and actually doing good deeds while we are at it. If we get damaged by this trade it's on us, not you.   Stay in front of the moving train and get crushed or hop on board and actually help make the world a better place for once in your life. Or you may stay on the sidelines and watch it as things unfold.  People are not as clueless as you may think. GME probably had better DD's than your criminal hedge funds can put out.   It's not your money. It's none of your bussiness. If you cared so much for people's financial situations you wouldn't short and bet on companies failing and people losing their jobs.  This is not a financial advice. I still like the stock.   ️   Edit: Bots learned to fight as a team. I'm loving it.
Well never thought about selling. Should I buy more? 🤔   🏻
If I die unexpectedly what happens to my stocks?
Can’t have some paper handed bitch selling my $GME after I’m gone

Douche Says sell and lesson learned
Realized I work with fellow apes today.

some of you are so angry about the United Apes of America & International Ape Association coming here 🤫   🦧
why do the apes bother you so much? it seems like you never got attention and you're very jealous that people are somewhat discussing and people new to this subreddit are getting a lot more karma than they have. if you don't like ape man let them be, you will not win war against apes, we go full retard and we going to the fuckin moon      so sorry you don't want to come for the ride, it's cool just keep it to yourself tho okay? no one likes ur salty negativity 🥲 side note: im not a financial advisor, only invest what you're comfy with💚 & don't let anyone tell you how to spend YOUR OWN MONEY.   or 💀 baby  fuck these salty bots, boomers and hedgies!  edit: tl:dr why they mad at ape parade?
The many tactics of those in power
And why they own your wife.  First, they called WSB many names. Greedy, selfish, insane, gambling addicts, colluders, apes, and even extremists that may be associated with the Capitol insurgents.  Second, they released articles saying the shorts have been covered and that hedges have exited their positions.   Third, they released articles saying silver is the next target of WSB. Through divide-and-conquer, distraction, and diversion tactics, they made WSB to seem to invest in a boatload of other things, when it's only GME that mattered. The eventual increase in share price of the other stocks pale in comparison and so could be treated as a loss, as long as GME losses are minimized.  Fourth, they made your wives fondle RH's, Etoro's, and other brokers' balls to restrict and limit trading, and to outright sell your shares without your consent or even knowledge.  Fifth, they infiltrated the sub and spammed nonsense to cast doubt and division among WSB and the Reddit community.  Sixth, they probably artificially inflated ala pre-mature ejaculation the share prices in order to cull the paper hands and gay bears. Right after this, they restricted the trading to further   the losses. Then, they plummeted the share price to drive home the fact that you should've sold around 300 and now people are panic-selling at a super low price. Hence, people fighting now and shit-calling WSB.   Seventh, in line with six, they probably paid a loss forward by buying a lot of shares, spiking the share price, and then selling them all off and buying back, triggering a chain reaction among retail investors.  Eight, they're fearmongering by tying DVF to a palisade and setting it on fire.  Ninth, they're showing off your wives to the SEC.
Guys don’t let the current price fool you, this is just a massive dip, and what have we been saying this whole time, BUY THE DIP!!
How to Support AMC over the weekend.
Just because you can’t buy stock until Monday, doesn’t mean you can’t support AMC over the weekend. Reach out to your local theaters and see if they do private screenings. I had a bunch of buddies do it 2 weeks ago. It was a couple hundred dollars for up to 20 people. They ended up watching Bad Boys and were talking about doing it again when they could watch Raiders of the Lost Ark.   Just a recommendation on a way that you can have a relatively safe outing while supporting an American Company.
Important dates for GME   ! Short interest gets published on 2/9 and 2/24. Those will be big days.
Obligatory:        Some info for the  :   Settlement Date: They are reporting short interest positions for their holdings on 2/29 @ 6pm. Thats the day GME was highest!   Due date: They have to turn in the report on this day.   Exchange Recipt/Dissemination Date: When those reports get published. Reports are published at 4pm on this day. This is when we will know if they covered any of their position or not.      I've never done anything like this before, but I imagine 2/9 is going to be very interesting. If its known that they haven't covered their position yet then its likely many more people will buy in and trigger the squeeze.      But watch out, they are going to be doing everything in their power to delay the squeeze and manipulate people! They might find a way to put off the squeeze until the next report on 2/24, so don't lose hope if nothing big happens on 2/9.      Good luck. May the    be with you.
They can’t keep this rocket grounded  🤲
Here’s some loss porn for you, still took profit but diamond hands did not prevail

More big media fear mongering
I’m fairly new here and new to this stock, just bought 5 shares today, but i saw something today that was too coincidental to ignore. My wife had adult swim on and they were playing the episode where Dale, Peggy and Minh Souphanousinphone follow bill around and bet on stocks based on what people like him buy, they end up gaining a ton of money initially but then when he knows they are observing him in this way it stops working because he feels pressured and their golden goose is no more. I thought the timing of it was weird with everything going on in the stock market right now with GME and everything. Almost like they’re trying to subliminally tell us this is what’s going to happen. Or am I looking too much into it
GM - Super Bowl Ad - Disaster Marketing
Hello GM,  Nice new logo BTW.   I watched your GM electric car commercial(s) that will be played during the Super Bowl (available on YouTube).  To summarize: Will Ferrel educates America that Norway buys more electric cars than any other country and we need to “crush them” (wow sounds like us needed to crush the shorts).  So let’s break this down:  1. You insulted Norway (the largest consumer of the car your looking to sell). Nice 👌  2. You told me nothing about why I should choose your car over others. Is it the battery? You mentioned it, but what does it do? Nice 👌  3. When someone’s looking to buy a car, when the fuck do they ever think hmmm, wonder what those Norwegians are doing. Nice 👌  4. Now I’m looking at what car Norwegians (the people who buy the most electric cards) prefer. It’s Audi and Tesla if your curious. Nice 👌  Meh.... prolly watch you all YOLO into into Monday.

How does Ryan Cohen (tendy messiah for GME) only have 40k twitter followers?
Seriously, I had to lookup to see if it was actually his real account or if I had the wrong one. Kind of amazed that he has so few followers considering all the attention that both Gamestop and he have gotten.

What trading sites didn’t block $AMC, &GME, etc.
I’m looking for a new trading site since the bullshit. But seeing a lot of sites/apps blocked the stocks. What sites didn’t block them, and which do you recommend. Thank you
Stocks for a Post Covid world.
I'm thinking Tourism, Airline and Airport stocks would be worth investing in for the semi-long run (6 months?) Anything that lost more than 50% due to Covid-19.  We have vaccines now, within the year things will be 'mostly' normal.  Quarantine-free travel, an utter explosion in immigration and tourism.  Here in NZ, when we ended our 2 local lockdowns the amount of retail spending and 'local tourism' exploded to the point where it practically wiped away any losses caused due to Covid.  I'm thinking the same will happen with international travel. BOOM millions of people booking trips overseas.  I've got 80% of my portfolio in Air New Zealand, and am thinking of buying into Sky City Casino, Auckland Airport and Kathmandu (  gear).  If something similar exists in your country, I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet to return 40% +
Wtf ?? Wtf is this ?? It shot up to $300+ after hours ???
Oh No!!!! Am I doomed without access to all those awesome features from “robbing the hood”? Bye bye RH.... hello fidelity.
What happens to a "call" after it's due date?
Hello, my call is due today for 800 C. I paid $4 for it, what do I do with it now?  Thanks
GME long!
GME long is the way! I’m not pushing anyone to buy at all. In fact, I’d love to average down, so let it tank to $4. I could average in at a great price! The recent GME spotlight has brought a lot of needed attention to a business that has recently fell into the right hands! I’m hopeful about seeing a lot come out of them in terms of smart e-commerce and valued subscriptions soon! ✌️

WSB is monitoring the sub
GUH
The Squeeze Squoze
$PTSH is a   preparing for launch. Best protected downside and highest upside stonk available now.
I’m jacked to the tits in $PSTH based on DDs of others on WSB and some special needs people on Twitter.  And by jacked I mean converted my old 401k from Oracle into a brokerage link on fidelity and bought 209K (  in $PSTH shares and 38K in $IPOE. I also bought 50k in shares (  in my trading account and 18k worth of 12/17/20 c40 at $6.  My fidelity accounts have 894K total now and 301K (up a little from when I got in) is in $PSTH positions.  Too many times I see posts of people posting about a stock after the thing already mooned... annoying.  When the company is announced this thing will rocket and I’m holding because if it’s stripe it’s going to be a $500B market cap company in 2-3 years. (I know what brothers said on Twitter 3 months ago, but in the world of tech that’s an eternity).  Hope you have at least a small position in $PSTH and hold it
Newbies looking at GME
Greetings fellow tards/autists/apes,  There’s a good chance of this getting downvoted to oblivion but I thought I would try to help new entrants to the GME saga. I’ll try to keep it nice and short.   After participating in the tard-lympics I have noticed a few trends and I think they are likely to repeat on Monday. The SSR restriction has been lifted after a green day and I believe the shorts will be extremely aggressive lowering the price.  Everyone knows that the updated SI gets released Tuesday and they are going to try to kill any momentum.   I don’t know if we can even trust the number on Tuesday because we all know they have tricks galore up their sleeves (and it’s an old number etc etc) but if it comes back high, they know everyone will be reinvigorated. They want the share price to be as low as possible if that were to happen.   I have 100 shares and have nothing to gain from this other than hopefully helping others position themselves in a better spot than I’m in.   If I were to enter a new position after experiencing the ups and downs I would enter Monday afternoon and possibly even AH. I have no clue what will actually happen tomorrow but I expect us to open lower and then to slowly fall throughout the day. If you feel that we will have takeoff on Monday morning, go for it. But the last thing needed is paper hands joining and selling right away. If I’m wrong and GameStop somehow gets to $200+, I’ll get diamond hands or can’t stop wont stop tattooed on myself as punishment. No way am I doing that for less than 20k though.   This is not financial advice, just random thoughts by a retard. Plus any financial advisor would tell you to stay the hell away from GameStop in the short term.   Anyway, back to searching for AOC feet pics.   Position and holding

I was just thinking of how much power you smooth brains have and do not even realise it.
Think about it, in just a week this subreddit went from just another sub on reddit to having global recognition turning the stock market upside down and dropping it on its head just like you all were as kids, the sub was even labelled a terrorist group, you bunch of autists terrorists HAH.  What I'm trying to say is if we could do what we did with GME (saving the company mind you)  why couldn't we use the power of this sub to throw humanity into the future and invest in companies that say make electric cars and do the same thing we did with GME but for a better cause, speeding up the process helping the little guys out and really investing in the future.
I started investing in September. I did my own DD and made my own stock picks and turned $5k to   in 4 months, then I got greedy.

Need some advice
Hello! I have been investing small amounts of money for a while and was wondering what advice you had. Stocks, strategies, whatever you have!
Try and figure out what’s happening here
Averaging Down of GME and AMC
I'm currently holding:    GME at $320    AMC at $12.    I'm thinking of starting to average down my positions for both.  For AMC, I will be able to average down my cost to $  per share.  Prior to the pandemic, AMC was operating above this price and issuing dividends on a regular schedule. And I expect to watch the next James Bond movie in an AMC theatre once vaccines are distributed.  By averaging down, I will be shifting my horizon to the long term and I think this could work for a decent gain.  But, I'm not certain this strategy would work with GME.  At the current price, I could average down my position to $75, but that is still 3-4x higher than its historical performance (before the squeeze).  I'm wondering if there is a strategy for GME for those holding high?  Selling my current position is not an option.      I like the stock.
Leaving Robinhood. Unexplained Margin amount remains on account?
I’m transfer to Fidelity and Robinhood after all of this mess. I attempted to transfer the account and fidelity says i have $299 in margin thats unsettled via robinhood and i either have to clear it up with RH or apply for margin through Fidelity. My account at RH says I have 18cents in buying power. How can i owe RH $300 still??? Both recent bank transfers into RH have already been cleared. Is there something I’m missing?
Td Ameritrade stock lag on purpose?
Anyone using td Ameritrade feel like they’re slowing down and manipulating trades? There is definitely something going on with the way trades are going through,not just high volume or volatility,someone needs to investigate manipulation!

Sitting cheap at  , ZOM is my next buy.  Zomedica is a veterinary Biosciences company. They've done well for themselves, considering lots of Biosciences companies fail to turn a profit these days.   For one I think it's refreshing to invest in a medical company that's not making a COVID vaccine.  Yes you've probably heard of this stock before, but it's far from over.   They have lots in the works: "Still, Zomedica has a compelling growth opportunity. The veterinary health specialist is slated to launch its patented Truforma diagnostic system on March 30. The platform is designed to produce fast and accurate results when used to detect diseases in dogs and cats. InvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango believes Zomedica could generate $250 million in revenue by 2025, thanks to Truforma's time- and cost-saving advantages over existing veterinary diagnostic methods. If he's right, Zomedica's stock could have more upside ahead."   Yes this DD is short, just like my dick, but whatever. That's why my wife has a boyfriend, cuz I can't do the job.

A Candid Post About Knowing When To Take A Loss
I know a lot of people were burned by GameStop. Some of y’all are down 85%.  We should talk about the lessons that we should learn from this experience:  -	There is great power in memes. Seriously holy shit y’all. $18->$500? -	Get off Robinhood. Use a real brokerage like Fidelity.  -	The notion that it’s not a loss until you sell is dumb as hell. It might take you 15 years to recover the money in GameStop. But if you just sold at a loss, and moved it to a smarter investment... you might actually come out ahead by June.  -	maybe don’t buy into a stock that’s up 800% in a week?   When you sell for a loss, you are not admitting defeat. You are saying, “wow, my investment thesis was wrong. I should take this as a learning opportunity and re-examine the decisions and choices and beliefs I had entering this position.” I know you smooth-brain apes aren’t going to have this thought.  Current positions:  -	1000 shares MSFT -	100 shares F -	100 shares T -	100 shares KO -	Sep ‘22 $80 call AAPL -	Sep ‘22 $80 call TSM -	Sep ‘22 $60 call AMD -	100 shares KHC -	100 shares BAC -	100 shares SQ -	100 shares DIS -	10 shares SHOP -	a fuck load of boring ETFs like FZILX and FXNAX  Selling theta on anything 100 shares. Not selling theta on my MSFT because I’d rather hold it than make   every week. Ford theta rates are closer to 3% every week.  Look at these positions. What am I doing with them? I’m farming 3% weekly yield on anything 100 shares and then reinvesting that yield into other assets — namely, shop.   I’m making LEAPS calls on companies I fucking KNOW are going to go up. You autistic fucks think that Apple is boring. Apple isn’t boring at   leverage. And guess what? Apple. Goes. Up.
$EVAX - Evaxion Biotech full DD
tl;dr: not this time. I see many people asking how/where to find new multi-bagger stocks, well I think this might be it. Below is reasoning why I believe this might be the case. There is plenty of time to board the ship as IPO was just few days ago (5th of Feb). Also, this won’t give you any quick gains to write home about. It’s more like casino where you can make an informed bet – and here is the info I could find. It should go without saying, but   I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice!   Just opinion and invite for discussion.  (  Sources in comments  )  I’ve posted a shorter version of my DD last Friday. Will use some of the same sources, so this one could be stand-alone DD.    \- The main source I’ll use is presentation published by Evaxion Biotech. I recommend to go through it to get a picture on how big are things there are working on. It does much better job, than what you will ready below.    Premise  : We as society are collecting more and more data about everything and that includes  DNA  data. Our AI data analytics technology is getting more robust every day. Combine loads of  DNA  data with AI capabilities and we might get the following:  · Highly personalized treatment. We all know that each one of us is slightly different and those differences are coded in our genetics. For example, most vaccines are safe for like   of people and are beneficial for whole community as it stops spread of disease by heard immunity. In my opinion it would be completely ethical to let that   slide if based of their  DNA  composition it’s clear that vaccine might have side effects. It wouldn’t impact success of vaccinations, but would reduce unfortunate events that fuel some of the conspiracies.  · Better understanding of allergies and food reaction. We all react differently to the same food and this depends mostly on our gut biome (sometimes that gang can be very picky!). By analyzing humongous amounts of data AI systems could predict specific reactions to treatments and suggest the best options.  · Aging. Some scientists say that aging is a disease as any other and it might be cured. If this is true, then how we age is, again, coded in our genetics. Amount of data stored there is probably not really comprehendible for most of us, but using a bunch of cleverly written algorithms it does become a ‘crackable’ task, thus there should be a lot of room for advancements.  · Machine learning advances. Most of the algorithms are available publicly at hat helps to advance entire field forward. AI driven medical solutions are getting more and more traction, which attracts big money and that in return spirals even more advances in the field as it becomes profitable and self-propelling thing.  If you want to read more about how AI and big data works together to provide remarkable analytic abilities, antigen and phenotype detection, predicting prognosis and treatment outcomes – check   Source 2  .  Obviously, there are many huge companies working on AI driven immunotherapy solutions (Intel, Microsoft, NEC, most large medical companies aka ‘big pharma’). Evaxion Biotech probably is not going to outcompete them, but they target specific areas of expertise and already have 8 issued patents with 46 pending applications. I wanted to have a closer look and here it is.    Company  : Evaxion Biotech A/S, a clinical-stage artificial intelligence-immunology platform company, identifies and develops novel immunotherapies for the treatment of various cancers, bacterial diseases, and viral infections. The company develops therapies using PIONEER, an immuno-oncology platform; EDEN, a bacterial disease platform; and RAVENTM, a viral disease platform.  Here is what those platforms are actually used for (  Source 3  ):    PIONEER   platform for the identification of patient-specific neoepitopes to potentially transform the immuno-oncology treatment landscape.   Advantages  : Identification of Therapeutic Neoepitopes, Speed, Identification of Therapeutic Patient-Specific Neoepitopes, Identification of Multiple Neoepitopes, Strong Clinical Applicability, Potential for Repeat Use Over Lifetime of Patient’s Cancer Treatment, Favorable Safety Profile, Continuous Improvement.    EDEN   platform for the identification of broadly protective antigens for use against bacterial diseases.   Advantages  : Highly Efficient and Reduced Attrition, Identification of Novel and Unbiased Targets, Data Driven Precision, Ability to Provide Broad Protection, Optimizes Antigen Design, Speed, Scalability.    RAVEN   platform for the rapid response to future pandemic viral diseases.   Advantages  : Promiscuous T-cell Epitopes, Multiple Hits on Target, Coverage of Entire Viral Cycle, Mutation Proof, Neutralizing Focused, Broadly Applicable.    People  : Copenhagen where Evaxion Biotech is based has high concentration huge medical companies. It’s sometimes called a ‘Medicon Valley’   (source 4  ). All of which meaning that concentration of expertise is there and that reflects on composition of company (  source 1  ):     Also check out who is on their board of directors and advisors panel. There’s even a guy who’s a member of the Nobel Award Panel.    Research  : Development of pipeline candidates including lead programs EVX01, EVX-02 and EVX-B1, enhancement of proprietary platform technologies. What are all these codes about you can find in Source 1. I told you, this one is good.    Upcoming Catalysts  : FY2020 results (4/26/21); Q12021 results (5/13/21); shareholders meeting (5/25/21); EVX-01 Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial readout anticipated in first half of 2021   (Source 1  ); EVX-02 Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial preliminary data readout expected first half of 2021 (  Source 1  ); EVX-03 Initiation of toxicology studies and submission of regulatory filing H2 2021 (this is for Skin and soft tissue infections  vaccine – it doesn’t exist at the moment).  This is sneak peak on preliminary data from EVX-01 clinical trial (more in   Source 1   and fist dose info –   Source 5  ):       Industry Catalysts  : Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare Market Size Worth $  Billion By 2027   CAGR of   (  Source 7  ). People like charts, so there’s couple of them (  Source 10  ):        I don’t know about you, but for me it looks like ‘dolla, dolla, bill ya'll’. In general healthcare industry is robust to various economic impacts – we all get sick, we all age, doesn’t matter if economy is up or down.    Summary  : it’s important to understand that all clinical trials face the same risks, just because they go through the same process and we can assign some probabilities here using data about success rate of those trials. This is how all phases of research looks (  Source 6  , more data on success rate of therapeutic areas –   source 8  ):  Phase 1: Several months, approximately 70% of drugs move to the next phase;  Phase 2: Several months to 2 years, approximately 33% of drugs move to the next phase;  Phase 3: 1 to 4 years, approximately 25-30% of drugs move to the next phase.   This where approval of FDA or their equivalent takes place.    Phase 4: Phase IV clinical trials happen after the FDA has approved medication. This phase involves thousands of participants and can last for many years.  Now all above is for a standard clinical research. Evaxion Biotech comes into play with AI driven clinical research and that helps a lot to streamline whole process. Read more on AI impact on clinical trials in   Source 9  .  As mentioned in tl;dr, given all the info above I believe $EVAX could explode once results of current clinical research starts rolling out. This might be that chance to get in something at the very beginning and enjoy the results in couple of years. Place your bets responsibly!  My position: 50 @   (contemplating going deeper on Monday and looking for some affirmation or challenge in comments)  That’s it. Now do your own DD. I’m not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.  Share if you know what's stock performance of similar companies.

Yes... another GME post - Just my thoughts
The general vibe in the sub seems to be that it’s over.   I’ve seen actual evidence that shows it’s not, (Bloomberg terminal screen shots, showing 177% float)  Please correct me (link) but all those that say it’s over, is just theoretical. I haven’t seen any ACTUAL evidence that the shorts have been covered.   Again, for evidence, please link or explain why you think this is over?   I ain’t holding much, 3 @ 65  EDIT: Here, facts...    Please show me facts where this is over?
DON’T BELIEVE WHAT YOU HEAR FROM ROBOTS AND
First off, to the people who sold and got out, we have to respect their decisions. Not everyone can have diamond hands, that’s what makes them so special. These people are highly risk averse or had bills to pay and I get that. But you’re stupid if you risked money you needed for bills.   Now, there’s all this talk of gain and loss porn like it’s over. It ain’t over til we say it’s over. We’re still the ones who own stock and the hedgies are still the ones shorting it and will have to buy it from us. Look at the recent DD’s here and elsewhere. They’ve now shorted an estimated 177% of the stock. Even if that’s way off and it’s only 90%, that’s still far too much. They’ve exposed themselves too much. Don’t listen to the bots or the media or the distractions or those that got out early.   HANG IN THERE MY BOYS, WE’RE STILL GOING TO THE MOON TOGETHER
$274k gains year to date . A lot of it came from you all. Thanks
Love to the OGs and true autists. But be prepared for a battle. Shills be gone.
Retail investors may have a fight on their hands to keep what they have without the government putting their finger on the scale in favor of institutional traders any more than they already do.  1.) GME ran up the ticker to massive levels. 2.) Citron sings a new song. 3.) Retail investors wrecked a hedge fund using decentralized efforts to enrich each other legally and ethically. 4 We all made our own decisions on an individual basis.  5.) Infighting amongst each other is the opposite of why we all did very well for ourselves. We should keep that at the forefront of our minds in the days to come.    Please remember what is best for retail investors is what is best for you because it is what you are.   I will stand and fight for the people on the opposite side of the trade than I am. I will not expect you to spend your money buying the stock that I want to see succeed. However, if you cant see that fighting against the bullshit that Robinhood et al pulled is in    your own best interest    you are far beyond helping. You cant even stand up for yourself.   That being said, if you are here to antagonize other retail traders who made beast-ass trades and were up tens of thousands of dollars before they got fucked: please block me. I'm a down voting motherfucker and I will take the time out of my day to relegate you to all of the fake ass forums that WISH they were the real wallstreetbets. I am here for the people who want to do positive things and make a difference in the world while they help others learn and enrich each other.  If you're not one of them you can eat a bag of herpes ridden dicks and I'm not above letting you know it.  You wish you had the insight to see it coming, get in early, and turn a profit--    that's why you're fucking sour.    You didn't lose profits you made: you didnt have the savvy to get far enough to lose any profits because that would mean you would have had the brains to make trades that made a profit    to begin with   .   (General FYI in closing: By moving to sell only restrictions for its millions of customers Robinhood fucked not only its users  but EVERYONE invested in the restricted stocks.  This was exacerbated, by not providing us with advanced notice regarding when trading would be normalized... again regardless of whether you are a Robinhood user or not... stockholders were unable to make informed decisions regarding future market conditions. Prices are prices regardless of your trading app and they suffered.)    Love to the OGs and true autists.  You make me proud.
Don't forget to give back some of your tendies to charity and your community. A lot of businesses have been struggling this past year while the Melvins of the world were getting richer and popping c . Made some bones on AMC calls so decided to give it back to my local theater.

$BB vs others going to   ($GME, $NOK, $AMC etc)
The title was a clickbait - this post is about $BB and not $GME, $NOK, $AMC etc  Check out these DD posts on Blackberry by fellow retards over the weekend:                 BB seems like a LONG-play and not a quick to    wsBET. I'm long on $BB: I got in @$19.   Remember to do your own DD and not just follow the wisdom of fellow retards.   Lesson from the past couple of weeks: You can learn from the crowd but it's your money, after all!
CHECK YOUR ACOUNT STATUS NOW - SHADY BROKERS
Many brokers have sneakily converted your cash accounts into margin accounts in order to loan your shares to shorts.  If we all convert back to cash it will force the brokers to call in the shares and the shorts will have to purchase new shares to cover the outstanding.   This could well cause another squeeze of unimaginable squeezyness if enough people are able to do it before the 9th.   Copied from /u/pandaemonium   "Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?"    a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account.  Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it.  If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high).  Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.  edit: /u/rozhasi says "Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can’t lend your shares to short sellers."  edit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though new Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.) If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into.  edit3: from /u/brewlee. In DEGIRO you can check it by clicking ladder in top left corner, then triangle right to your name, then its second position from top. You can check your account status there. If it's not custody, I am sorry, you pay for the hedge's. The account at DEGIRO is unchegable. You have to make new account and transfer funds  Credit to /u/pandaemonium for his DD it can be accessed below.
Anyone saying sell, sold, or “look at my gains.”
If you are any of the above I respectfully ask you shove a dildo in your mouth until after we done with the process. (Which is us talking anti-gravity shits in the moon and chucking them at the sun.)  We all remember BIG DAVE PORTNOY, they paper handed cum stain HAD to announce he lost 700k and blamed everyone but himself for selling. Further, if you did sell SHUT YOUR FAT MOUTH.  The big boys are playing and we don’t need anything but BUYS, and SOLID DD’s to educate our smooth brains.   Also mods, instill confidence and quite being suck cucks. You are allowing hedgies to fuck your girl while you watch. PATHETIC EXCUSE for a breathing piece of water garage.   We are on the cusp of sweet, sweet victory. And to all the boys churning out long ass DD’s just know I read them and I follow each and every link you beautiful bastards.   TL;DR: it ain’t that long you needle dicked commie  Edit: Post all the gain porn, statements stating you are selling and celebrating the success of the spike. I will be holding. There will be gains, and I’m hoping that the boys can take advantage of the short position that is being alluded, by many, to have been missed. Until next time my guys. See you on the other side. Don’t delete your comments, because when we are the moon eating tendies together. I’ll call you my fellow retard.

Savings crushers
So, first you follow someone who wants to start a movement and end up devaluing many retirees portfolios because of your own selfish uneducated wagon jumping, and now you are continuing to hold on to your losses and facing carnage to your own portfolios?  This is akin to the unknowing masses storming the capital. What a crazy time
Funny when you think about it, but...
The most Gamestop thing you can do with that stock is buy it at a high price and sell it back for a fraction of what you paid.
Stimmy jump
About 127,000,000 people will be getting a $1,400 stimulus soon. If only 1%(1,270,000) of those people were    and put their check directly into it GME that would be about $1,700,000,000 of stock bought and held. Wouldn't that event alone cut the amount of available shares in half and double the SI%?
The current short situation! GME is riding high
Tracking Articles: Observation Bloomberg hates WSB
See for yourself:      What I'm doing is linking together articles which were published then tagging them to look for data on who and why they were   can help if you like, editing on the Notion board is enabled.

MEOH seems to have a bit of a jump in the last 2 days...`
Weird as no news but huge upswing of a few % a day lately. Like a sleeper value. And the stock target was adjusted down of all things.  Well if methanol fuel cells are a thing soon it would get interesting. Fuel cells currently are crippled by the need for pure hydrogen which makes them quite impractical... look up the Toyota Mirai and its availability.  A methanol fuel cell would be a game changer. Not sure why this company doesn't see that kind of potential.
Nano Dimension long hold
I’ll be buying and holding long term Nano Dimension or NNDM. 10th largest holding under ARKQ which is actively managed by Cathie Woods. Cathie manages ARKQ ARKW and ARKK. All great performing funds.   NNDM Is the only stock under holdings for ARKQ that is less than $50. Its actually $15 right now. It crashed from a $60 IPO back in the day to $3 until ARKQ bought into it and other companies started to throw money at the company evaluating it much higher than it was.   The reason it crashed in the first place was because their original ceo was arrested for fraud. Much better ceo in place as of January 2020.  The company has propriotity 3-D printing technology called "dragon-fly" that can 3-D print microchips. Its a big innovation in 3-D printing. This is good for chip companies and companies as a whole for 3 reasons. Companies would likely buy for these reasons.  1) It reduces costs since theres less waste.   2) Don't have to worry about IP being stolen because companies can produce in-house.   3) Probably the most important. The 3-D printing allows a chip manufacturer to be a lot more precise and fit more in less space. Something they were incapable of prior.   The main thing is the company has terrible earnings because their innovation is new as of last year. But its significant enough to get the attention of cathy and other firms. Enough for her to make it her 10th largest holding as of this last year. Its gone up from 2 to 15 since then but i still thinks its not evaluated high enough enough because that technology alone should prove to be very useful and very innovative for the years to come. And once they start showing positive earnings it'll probably blow up.  For $15 i thing its a good long hold since there could be a lot of upside potential. It's market cap is only 62 million. There EPS is getting better. Getting less negative except for Q3 in 2020.   Definitely going to pick up some shares but thats just me  🏻‍♂️. Just wanted to share, lil risky.
Broker Strat: Cutoff Trading to Reverse Upwards Momentum
Honest question if you were up like +10,000%, why wouldn’t you cash-in? What are you waiting for?
For all us smooth brained apes out there that don’t eat crayons... If I you invested $5k and turned it into $500k ... what else were you waiting for?  YOU WON LOL
$RIDE DD
$RIDE is obviously the leader in more industrial uses for EVs. If you look at the rest of the market and where EV and AVs are going there is an almost certainty in my head that Lordstown will be worth 50B+ in the next year. Get in while you can as this is a huge opportunity that is still early enough for you retards to get in.
Robinhood to Fidelity account transfers come through as margin accounts
Spent   hours on the phone with Fidelity wondering why selling shares resulted in a positive margin balance. After speaking with the Fidelity margin team it seems that “instant buys” on robinhoods side were margin purchases behind the scenes. I had to have them manually change my account to a cash account. Just a heads up for all of those making the move.
Very important DD regarding AMC’s future. Form 8-K filed FEB 1 2021, signed today
Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): February 1, 2021   AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC.   On February 1, 2021, Wanda America Entertainment, Inc. (“Wanda”) converted its Class B common stock, $  par value per share (the “Class B common stock”) of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), into an equal number of the Company’s Class A common stock, $  par value per share (the “Class A common stock”), pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”). No additional shares of Class B common stock will be issued following such conversion.   The conversion occurred pursuant to Article IV, Section M of the Charter, which provides that each share of Class B common stock shall be convertible into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder thereof at any time upon written notice to the Company. Pursuant to Article IV, Section M, the shares of Class B common stock that are converted pursuant to this section shall be retired by the Company and shall not be available for issuance.   The conversion had the following effects, among others, on the holders of the Class B common stock:   Voting Power. Prior to the conversion, Wanda as the holder of shares of Class B common stock was entitled to three votes per share of Class B common stock on any matter submitted to a vote of the Company’s shareholders. As a result of the conversion, all holders of Class A common stock have only one vote per share on all matters subject to a shareholder vote. In addition, the provisions of the Charter and Delaware law that entitled the holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, in certain circumstances, to separate class voting rights are no longer applicable as a result of the conversion.   Economic Interests. Because holders of shares of Class A common stock are entitled to the same economic interests to which Wanda was entitled with respect to its Class B common stock before the conversion, including with regard to dividends, liquidation rights and treatment in connection with a change of control or merger transaction, the conversion had no impact on the economic interests of Wanda.     Capitalization. The conversion had no impact on the total number of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of capital stock; the shares of Class B common stock converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. The conversion also had no impact on the Company's total number of authorized shares of capital stock.  What does this all mean?
Spheri al Graphite and GPHOF
$GPHOF  Highly reccomend checking this company out. Theyve got a huge Spherical Graphite mine being set up in Alaska. Its next to a great spot near a sea port  something that not a lot of major graphite mines have access to. Its had some recent developments, and spherical graphite has been added to the list of "resources of national importance"   Its gone from 60 cents to   and im seeing it being a 10-20 dollar stock eventually with the amount of graphite they have there.
GME cult is a parasite using WSB as its host body.
Please consider moving to a dedicated subreddit for the movement.   We support you but from afar.  Please let WSB resume its normal option trading ways .     I feel like the noobs have a deathgrip on WSB because it provides some form of legitimacy to their cause.   Imitating the lingo here gives them an identity to adhere to.   They know nothing about stocks so leaving isn’t really an option,  they just need to stay close to the source.
Attention captain. These fuckers aren’t sellin!
Hello fuck tards. For those that held, good job. For those that sold, leave now. HOLD and make history. Buying is OK too. Holding 300 here and steady as she goes. If they are still short a shit ton come Tue this will get fun. Let’s go !
My bet is still there. If $GME hits $100 or more anytime next week I’m posting a vid of me and the cat poop. It got close today
GME hitting 100 or more by next Friday is me licking some cat poop like Step Brothers.
I love how since the mods had their little....  kerfuffle    have been A LOT LESS anti-GME chatter and bots in here. Keep up the good work, mods!
All those old mods must've been bought out or something, glad thats over with.
So with all this stock hype and loss porn....
How many people here have told/showed their spouse how deep in loss they currently are with their investments? Keeping it a secret? IF this tanks, how will you go about showing them that your savings have magically disappeared? If you showed them, and they had no clue about your investment until now, how did they react? I wish everyone here the best.
My Broker freely admits to protecting Stakeholders, at the expense of their Clients.
When my Broker, let's call them Eye Gangster dotcom AU, advised of trade restrictions last week, I submitted a ticket with a simple query. I asked;    If I'm allowed to close my existing position, but retail traders are not allowed to open new positions, who's buying these closed positions?    The Eye Gangers replied, several days later, with the following personal email;    Thanks for your email. The restrictions are currently applied to all clients.     To clarify further, all stakeholders and risks have to be carefully considered, and in this case we decided to prioritise safety of stakeholders, and thus take a more conservative approach to this unfamiliar market behaviour until we are confident that our systems can hold up and that risks can be quantified and managed effectively. This is by no means ideal for our clients, and we are not gaining from this restriction, but more-so buying ourselves time to assess and regroup. We hope to allow such instruments to be traded as soon as possible so that the market can be accessible and integrity can remain.   By definition, a "Stakeholder" is a third party with a vested interest in the arrangement between the Service Provider (Eye Gangster) and the Client (me).   I'm not an expert, but my wife's boyfried told me:   1. By restricting my trades, there is an opportunity loss for every time I monkey mashed the "Buy" button, and the Eye Gangsters canceled the order. (Long with funds available in the account, not CFD) 2. Restricting trades by others caused my existing positions to lose value.   As the Eye Gangsters (and presumably other brokers) freely admit they put the interest of Stakeholders ahead of the interests of their Clients, and since it could be argued that the actions of these Brokers resulted in losses, could this be grounds for a Class Action?

Have any of you noticed the establishment actually paying to have ads on reddit to discourage investors?
Rupert Murdock and company (media moguls) Cleary have a boner for the investors here at WSB given the ad blitz of articles clearly meant to discourage investors I'm seeing on reddit. I'm the type to keep my cards close to my chest so community investment strategies aren't really my style but I can respect what you all are doing here. I'm a bit taken back about how brazen the establishment has been in squashing the little guy in this instance. Sucks that Reddit is cashing in on this propaganda   too. Best of luck to you all!
The amount of negative articles being posted around the internet and the attempted narrative on AMC and GME
Am I the only one who looks around at various news sources posting all these negative AMC and GME articles and then asking myself..."Hmm sure is weird how hard they are trying to push the narrative that these two stocks should be avoided at all costs and they're doing so bad and everything.  Seems like to to me if the stocks were really in as much trouble as they are saying that they wouldn't be constantly bringing it up.    Just was wondering if I'm the only one  who thinks this, something tells me I'm not...
AMC: what's your move ? (Plz no diamond hand memes)
So when I heard about GME I said to my buddy I wanna buy 1,000 shares of AMC before the pandemic ends. The cost was 5$ that day and I opened my account on RH and by the time I had funds (also during the shut down) the price was around 17.   Long story short, I managed to get 1546 or so shares at around   cost basis. I bought 6 GME at 118.  Little did I know the AMC hype at the time was due to GME momentum and so it's been closely tied to the price the whole time.  That said, my original intent was, they just got out of bankruptcy by raising 900m $$ the pandemic is ending with a hopeful vaccine deployment by end of spring and 2 years worth of movies backlisted from the pandemic. (2020 hits and now 2021 hits coming out)   It was my genuine thought AMC would hit 20-30 by EOY. That's why I invested.   Positions: 1546 or so shares   or so atm.  Edit: changed tldr to long story short. Feck off.

A little DD on SAVA and its recent news.
Hi all,  Recently I have been following the SAVA boom and decided to do a little research into the product they're producing and see if the juice was worth the squeeze.  Some background on the drug in question:  As you may or may not know, they are currently finishing up Phase 2b trials of their potential drug PTI-125 ( .  The catalyst for the big increase was this article released on Feb 2, 2021 ( .  So based on the data we have so far I'm quite skeptical of the drugs effect to say the least. It appears to function according to its design in reducing CSF levels of circulating Tau protein and other neurofilaments it does not seem to provide a meaningful impact on the actual symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease.  To add another layer of skepticism, according to Cassava Sciences recent market movement they last issued a stock offering in November (  at a price point of $8. Their next opportunity for a stock offering is next Thursday. Take that for what it's worth, which could be nothing.  So, bottom line is I would be hesitant to put big money into this company long term. For the short term holders, you're likely to see huge swings in the price in the coming days and weeks but I don't think it will be based on the merits of the drug.  Good luck and thanks for reading! I welcome any evidence countering these thoughts and look forward to some good discussion.     EDIT: also, I hold no current positions in this company but if I were to open a position it would like be early/mid March puts. I don't suspect good news from the FDA about clearing this drug so some of the potential catalysts are likely irrelevant at best and damning at worst.

Hey, retards - stop willingly feeding data to the sentiment bots.
When you see a post titled something along the lines of "Comment if you're holding GME!!!!!! \[insert rocket ships\]," there's a good chance that you're just feeding data to the bots.  Maybe take a peak at their history before handing the big boys exactly what they want.

Ape can not make TDAmeritrade understand that I am Diamond Hands!!
I'm new to this whole stonks thing, I saw all the loss porn and got semi-erect from it so I bought 10 shares of GME at $106. I cant sit and watch the ticker all day because my wife's boyfriend can not perform well if he isn't being watched. When I try to create a limit sell at $1000 the trade is rejected. "Order rejected:	Your limit is significantly higher than the last traded price. Confirm you are trading the correct security". And then there is no confirm button for this ape to mash. Can someone read the error message for me and tell me how to fix, I am retarded.

GME and AMC basically trading in lockstep? 🤔 Is it you guys that are buying and selling them in equal amounts?
In response to the posts claiming it's impossible that Melvin Capital/other hedge funds closed their short position
I see these posts on why it's impossible that they closed their position and I feel they are somewhat misleading.  First, we must simply admit that we don't know, and nobody knows except the hedge funds themselves. Some posts claim it's impossible based on volume; this is just not true. There were days last week where the volume was nearly 400% of the float. All the shorts could have even closed on the same day. And we saw share price skyrocket up which is what you would expect if they were closing their shorts.  Now, on Melvin Capitals claim that they closed their short position. I find that very unlikely, though we must admit we actually don't know. Nobody knows the truth except Gabriel Plotkin/his team. But here's my argument based on 2 premises:  1. There are no sources to Melvin for the claim they closed their short positions. There are no official statements from anyone at Melvin, no press releases, no evidence, no data, nothing. Melvin even shut down their own website, it's currently just a picture of their logo nothing more. Try to find the source of any one of those news stories: It is literally a news reporter claiming "we talked to somebody from Melvin and that they told us they closed their short position." In terms of market manipulation culpability, how can you find Melvin Capital guilty? You take him to court and he says "I never said that." And you have no evidence that he did, where's your case? News agencies print whatever they think will give them the most viewers, easy to see motivation for CNBC to post without caring whether it's true. 2. It seems implausible that one of the best shorters in the game would voluntarily realize the losses on a position when two conditions hold: The price is currently way above a fundamentals justified valuation hence given enough time it will surely crash. And two, that they have the resources to ride it out until that time. The second condition is often called into question, but I believe it must be true here; if they weren't margin called before the   investment, it's quite unlikely another billionaire investment genius would invest   into a fund which he thought would still be at immediate risk of getting margin called and losing everything.  Now to Point72 and Citdal's   investment. They didn't lend Melvin money, they invested. What they've done can sort of be compared to them shorting the stock at the peak, with favorable conditions due to Melvins position of need. They invested to get a "non-controlling portion of the revenue."  If Melvin is down 50% from their short positions, and citadel/point72's   billion allows them to ride through the peak without being margin called, then when they actually do close their short positions at a lower market price than the price when they received the   investment, then the investors (citadel/point72) immediately see a massive return on their investment. For ex, just suppose for sake of argument that the price dips to the number that Melvin originally shorted at and instead of these losses they broke even from the short. Since they were currently down 50% at the time of investment, it takes 100% of that amount to get back to where they were,   50%+50% = 100%. Thus the   billion Citadel/point72 invested see's 100% return in a couple weeks. GME likely won't drop that low, but it's already dropped from 400+ to 50$, so it's actually already most of the way there. Citadel and point72 are already winning huge.  There are things they could do which would make the claim that they "closed and re balanced their portfolio" technically true while still holding a massive short position in GME. For example, they claim to have closed on days where the price ranged from 150-400+$/share. They could have done some combination of closing short positions and re-opening short positions, as the effect of their buying to close shorts increased the price. As the price increased, they could profit off arbitrage between bid/ask; This can be done by closing at ask and re-opening at bid whenever bid/ask pushes upward. They surely have access to the ability to do this, as Citadel themselves is a market maker and this is exactly why Citadel pays so much for Robinhood's data. They use the data as a market maker to profit off arbitrage by prioritizing their own trades as all the other trades come in. I won't go into the details of profiting off arbitrage, but you can find plenty of sources online that explain how it's done and that Citadel is known to do this. It is questionably legal.  They may also simply not have closed their short position, as they would have to weigh the benefits of arbitrage profit and reduced ability to be margin called from 300$+/share price vs. the high borrowing rate (30%+) to short at the time. So if the   investment allowed them to sit through the peak last week, it may have been better to do that. Again, we just don't know.  So ultimately I feel it's misleading to draw conclusions which predict the market based on the analysis of whether Melvin/other funds closed their short positions last week. What really matters for GME's price in the future is that whatever the short interest rate turns out to be when the actual data is released on the 9th, a large number of all hedge fund shorts are now shorting from 300$+/share price. This is based on the short volume over the last 2 weeks being relatively high, on some days exceeding trade volume. It's going to be much, much harder to get shorts from 300$+ margin called.  Now all these new short positions are ITM and they'd like to realize their gain. If GME stays in the double digits AND continues to have high volume, they will have no trouble doing this. If volume goes down, then they are put in a tricky position as it increases the effect attempting to close their shorts by buying the stock has on the share price. So the biggest hope we have for a future price spike and possible squeeze is to see volume drop.  We are in a situation of balancing forces. The price can only go up so much above a fundamentals based justified price before new shorters enter the game. This is where the comparison to VW fails, as Porsche locked up so much of the float that there actually weren't enough shares left on the market for this kind of balancing of forces to play out.  Not financial advice, am retard.     Edit:   I also just wanted to add that another way Melvin / hedge funds can profit off this whole thing is when they open their shorts at 300$+/share, they can short additional fake shares. Based on the absurdly high failure-to-deliver numbers for GME, this is certainly being done. They simply short shares they don't have when they see the price as so unreasonably high that it will drop   300$+/share, and don't even have to pay interest on them. It increases the downward push shorting has on the stock price and increases your total potential gain for the new short position. And it's not necessarily good news to us retail investors like the post who say 'ahah theyre fucked they have to cover these made up shorts too'; it's just another tool they have that pushes GME price down and increases their profits. It would only become a problem if volume drops very low and/or a whale comes in a locks up a huge percentage of the float.     realized sub is retards, needs tl;dr  tl;dr it doesn't really matter whether Melvin closed their position or not. Short volume incredibly high when GME price was high = whatever the current short % is, most are now shorting from 300$+/share and ITM. And they will have no have a problem cashing out these ITM shorts as long as volume remains relatively high.

They Are Already Deep Fucking DeepfuckingValue In The Prints
I hate Robinhood as much as the next fucking retard who is still using that platform.  However, there are constant updates on the news feed, and every single one that I can see personally, at the moment, are regarding "Roaring Kitty" and how he violated every rule in the world.  It's fucking sad, and I am more depressed about how he's going to get railroaded than I am about how hard we all got fucked by Hedgehogs with all the fuckery that has taken place with Robinhood and the Meme Stocks.  They're already running hit pieces about him on just about any piece of shit 24/7 "news organization" online publications.  Only in the "World's Most Powerful & Greatest Super Nation" will some guy become a millionaire by pulling himself up by his bootstraps with all his gumption, only to be punished by a billionaire for daring to make money from the machine.  I know much of the argument is hyperbolic, but this is fucked.  We all got fucked.  He's going to get fucked more than anyone in this situation, and we need to recognize that.  He made a lot of money because he had the insight to believe that a stock was worth more than what it was priced at, and since he shared that knowledge with people, all of the sudden he's public enemy number one.  When people involved in the institution(s) share that knowledge, it's trade secrets and fine.  When someone selflessly breaks down the fundamentals of why they like this stock, and doing nothing other than share their opinions about it, it's "outsider trading," or whatever shit they're going to stick on him.  There's no real point to my post, and I doubt it will even go through, but if it at least one person reads this, I will fell better that people know how fucked up this entire run is going to be for our diamond-handed God.

Hey fellas, I made a sub called   for shareholders to specifically focus on AMC and its related DD & etc.
Store of Value
As someone who used to trade on most Video Games I just had a quick realization of how similar stocks are to certain rare in-game items in drop/skin based video games. At the end of the day, the drops or skins that the PUBLIC and PLAYERS decide are the best/most appealing/most memeable are always sold at the highest premiums. What happens if we all just continue buying this stock for eternity at all price levels as we would in game items in video games? Most people I know don't sell their best skins/items... So why should we sell our stock? We are the PLAYERS we decide what is valuable NOT THE HEDGEFUNDS. (  Tesla). I will leave you all with this metaphor: A Shark may surely be able to eat a school of smaller fish - but he he can not change the tide of the ocean. Instead of considering ourselves fish - consider ourselves THE OCEAN OF GME DIAMOND DICK HOLDERS. APES TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS IM HOLDING UNTIL I FUCKING DIE!!!!!!!!!!! VALHALLLLLLAAAAAAA

I was a chronically high math/computer science double major, did all of this DD while high, used yahoo finance and S3 screenshots, and am still holding my 39 shares @ 250, so I don't know shit and this could be completely wrong       a. as of 1/15 there were   shares shorted out of a total   shares available to short  b. according to S3 estimates, shorties didn't start covering until about 1/28  c. total volume of gme since 1/28 (inclusive):   +   +   +   +   +   =    d. weighted average of gme price (upon close) since 1/28 (the weight is the price's respective volume as a percentage of the total volume since 1/28):   \   + 325\   + 225\   + 90\   +  \   +  \   = $   e. assuming shorties played a game of numbers and DCA'ed, $  should be their estimated average cost per share  f. current estimated short interest is 39% (  shares), so the amount of covered short shares would be:   -   =    g. estimated total cost to cover (d \  e):  \   \~ $   1) we know this estimate is lower than what it really is because in our calculations we assume that only shorts are covering and no new shorts are being opened between 1/15 and now, however, in S3's estimates, short interest is accumulated after it's first decent from the range of 126% - 131%, therefore more shorts must have been covered and new shorts opened  2) we don't know how many shorts covered nor how many new shorts opened, but I would guesstimate this isn't greater than a factor of 3 (I know, shit mathematics right here, but we don't know these numbers, so this has to be a ballpark estimation)  h. estimated amount spent on gme since 1/28 (d \  h):  \   \~ $   i. given that $  was spent and only $  (within a factor of 3; so max   was spent on covering shorts, it is possible that shorts have covered the amount reported by S3  \ this doesn't account for option plays nor does it account for short ladder volume (I don't know how I would find that)
I'm new, non expert, totally support beating Billionaires - but are there other stocks?
I was in on buying GME this morning ... but apparently it takes 3 days for money to make it inside my trading app (I'm Canadian and apparently they protect me from buying things at low prices for my own good)      I have never bought stock before, and nobody should listen to me but I found a non GME stock and I'm curious what other people think.  During Covid I think video games, weed, self love, streaming services and billionaires cheating will make up much of the economy.  Since no billionaires will help   found a way to invest in weed.     FIRE  1) They sell marijuana.  (In Canada that's legal)    2) The stocks cost like 30 cents each and they trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange (I have no idea if that means Americans can buy it or not)   at 30c each I can afford to buy like more than 7 stocks (unlike GME by the time my app lets me join the party way too late)   3) I thought having cheap stocks was a bad sign (it probably is, I am not an expert) but they seem to think this year they will make money (That sounds like they should probably do that, again, not an expert but that sounds important)     4) i went to their website and they have a video of a guy sitting on a bench that they must think is awesome but I just laughed.  check out the "IO" part of their website.   🌿 ⌚💰😳     I think has great emoji potential and I just like the idea of owning a bunch of weed stock for like no money.   so when the training wheels come off my app - I was totally gonna buy Weed stocks.  Could I still be stupid?  If you want to look at it google   TSX FIRE stock.
To the SEC or anyone who might be interested:
Hey all! I hope you're holding well, I am!  Now that we have seemingly entered a phase of scrutiny from American Agencies I felt I needed to share this, and I encourage all of you to do the same:  User Deepfuckingvalue aka Keith Gill does not represent me, nor can speak on my behalf with regard to my purchase of share(s) of the company GameStop. I am a strong and independent monke and I have a made all my decisions based solely on my personal judgement. I have come to my own conclusion concerning my liking of this stock and was always fully aware of the situation.  I don't know about you folks but to me it sounds just fucking insane that DFV is being targeted by the Federal Agencies this way (well actually we don't know yet if he's really targeted to be a scapegoat, but better not take any risks) and I will not have my actions be used against him.  I have no idea what impact this might have, I'm not even in the US, but I'd really hate for them to pull some sort of "DFV manipulated all those poor people" without me being able to say something about it. And if they're gonna use messages on this subreddit as proof, well let this be one of them.  Obligatory: 1 $GME @ 344 and holding!

What kind of brokerage account are you magnificent     using?
I’ve been using a regular old Robin-The-Hood account with no tax advantages, no gold subscription, etc. But I heard from my wife’s boyfriend that some people are using tax advantaged accounts such as Roth IRAs to buy FDs.  However, it is my understanding that one can’t withdraw the gains (tendies) until old age. Why would I want to wait until I’m one foot in the grave to buy my Lambo?  Just looking for general info here on what kind of account everyone is trading with, and why?  5 GME Long

Hey   good.
We're already getting loads of free advertising right now. Buy more switches and less billboards.
This is the easiest money you’ll ever make. Why? Cause GameStop taught you the lesson long ago: You’ll only get pennies for your sales. Buying/holding is the only way. ♾💵
You know what to do.      ♾💵
Current GME holders : Is there anyone not holding a bag? Post a screen cap to show support!
If you are currently holding GME and not holding a bag, please post to give hope to our diamond hand brothers to keep holding!
I was in diapers last week, literally shitting money in my pants
We’ve learned a lot about wall street this week and now we go pee pee standing up.  We are coming for you wallstreet and Robinhood.  Don’t underestimate us.  We are learning to use the big boy potty.    GME gang hold the line.
PCG to double by EOY. This is a conservative estimate. DD inside.
I've posted about PCG before, I made a long DD post last week that got drowned out by the GME madness. But this is no GME. This is a grower, not a shower. Let's make this as simple as possible, if you want more DD, check my post history and look for      PCG got CRUSHED in 2018 by starting a massive wild fire and killing... too many people. It got gutted. Regulated. Fined.  Massive debt, bad rep, massive safety compliance regulations (hurts profits, but keeps people safe).  So where is the upside?  Nov 2020, new CEO hired (Patricia "Patti" Poppe). Female, intelligent, good track record. Not your typical middle age white executive "I got this job because I know someone", but a straight up BOSS. New VP and customer service executive appointed Jan 2021, and FUCKING   PALANTIR'S   FOUNDRY software announced in the same month... last month!   They are the very FIRST company to use Foundry. THE FIRST! Need a high tech, intuitive, data analytics software to keep your power grid safe and efficient? How about THE BEST SOFTWARE AVAILABLE. Fuckin' Patti Poppe knows what she's doing.   New, boss level CEO steps in, knows this dumpster fire needs 2 things, better management and better software.  This is a recovery story waiting to happen.   They ALSO just announced selling nearly $1 billion in rights to cell providers to use their existing towers. No work required, just a billion dollars check to help cover current debt... just by selling rights to a small chunk of their MASSIVE infrastructure.  They're starting to move, low risk, possible 2-5x return in 1-3 years. Lost half your net worth on GME?  Check out a safer, but bullish alternative.

It's become clear that most of you newfucks have no idea what you are talking about. Most of the front page here lately has been downright embarrassingly bad takes with even worse data backing them up. I have to scroll way too deep into the threads to even find someone who can be bothered to explain the fucking basics.  This is how far we've fallen. The madness is so normalized that people aren't even willing to teach.  It's also clear that most of you don't realize the absolute gold mine you've stumbled upon here. This place is great not just because of the unparalleled memes, unbridled shitposting, and unfiltered humor. It's great because there's a godamned educational opportunity of a life time here.

Nio dd for people who actually wanna trade a stock that won’t go bankrupt
Now that we have   million degens here it’s time to discuss the bull case for my favorite stock.... NIO  Chinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I’m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year.   My bull case....   EV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don’t think they’ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.  Introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.  That beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.  Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025.   Deliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they’re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year’s 43,728 deliveries.   They’ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.  NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA.   Cameras also kill   Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X. It redefines the standards of autonomous driving sensing systems.

DFV - A Request for a Brief History
Hi. Been here a while but never posted until the recent hullabaloo. In fact, I rarely ever looked at the sub.   But I've had some renewed interest in stonks and the GME story was a really fun one to follow - and hell, it still is.   With my renewed interest, I watched DFV's youtube videos from 5+ months ago and in hindsight, man, the dude hit the nail on the head. Tremendous foresight that, looking back on it, makes him a genius in my book .  My question/s is/are: how much buzz was there for GME 5+ months ago? Was DFV posting about it or generating interest here? How did his word get out? Generally, with such good advice, I am wondering how he got people to listen, and also, I am wondering if people, in fact, listened.   Are there any other users similar to DFV who are posting about future good value plays? I know this was literally a once in a lifetime type of trade with such a value increase, but I am wanting to get onboard the next   I need a fucking ticket! Of course, this current rocket is about to go into fucking overdrive, so I can wait.
Join Robinhood, take the next necessary step and get a stock for free up to $500 in worth..... What are you waiting for!!!
I made a real silver GameStop logo to remember the good and the bad
Yall got any more of those gamestonk
I hope this hasn't been done before
A sad and hopefully inspiring story to HOLD 😀
Context: I bought into GME AMC BB NOK TSLA with -$  in my bank account and rent due.  So this week I have found out multiple things. 1) My dad may be going to jail due to being late on child support. 2) I may have to take care of an autistic kid as a result due to my step mom not wanting to take care of him. 3) I found out that I am actually on the spectrum. (My mom hid this information from me so I could be stronger and raised me like a normal kid [I am also 22 so I spent all of my life unaware about this so I considered myself bad whenever I was bullied for not fitting in])  However,  I am going to continue to hold and play this game for the long run. I will literally forget that I even own gamestop stock before I sell for a loss.  These couple of weeks have been mentally draining for me due to all this weight.  BUT I WILL NOT SELL AND I WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD  I AM EMBRACING WHO I AM AND WHAT I OWN  I AM LITERALLY AUTISTIC  IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP OWNING THIS STOCK, I AM SELLING GME@1200, AMC@400, NOK@100, BB@140  YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY CONSIDERED A SNAKE IF YOU EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO TRY TO CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE  THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST MONEY  SHOUT OUT TO ALL MY FELLOW RETARDS FOR HOLDING 💯💯 WE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT EACH OTHER  ALL LOVE 🖤💚🤍
Uranium is the rockstar of commodities. It doesn't mess around - bull and bear markets are of epic proportions.
TLDR uranium is cheap, floats on all stocks are low, float of ENTIRE sector is <$10 billion, utilities are massively short material (not short shares in gamestop sense but short as in they have never had inventories this low in history AKA they need to buy), asymmetric risk return, and most importantly uranium is the fuel for clean, zero carbon, no fossil fuel electricity of the future to power future Wallstreetbets popeyes chicken tendie        What you need to know:  KAzatomprom + Cameco = 70% of the market  \-both of the above have cut production 40% collectivly, and are both buying spot market.  \-mine supply is running at 120m v\`s demand of 180m. rubber band moves both ways...  \-At this stage you want to own the uranium pyramid,  , the safest, KAzatomprom/Cameco, the riskiest, the juniors...     Largest publicly traded producers:  1,CCJ (Cameco)  2, Energy fuels  3, Kazatomprom (on london stock exchange)  Physical funds  1, Uranium participation corp (on TSX)  2, Yellowcake PLC.

Isn't the smart thing to do now is short Gamestop and AMC?
My market understanding is basic, but isn't that the next big play? Bet that the price is going to fall majorly, and since the big companies have struck out, that would leave the profit all to everyone on the sub? And if enough people here short it, in reverse to how GME skyrocketed, would we not double the profit AND have cut out billionaires, essentially making a mockery out of fools that put their life savings into, let's face it, a closed roulette table?   Or is that what influencers have already done? And they're telling this community to keep holding, knowing its crashing, so the market is easier to predict with a slow crash instead of a hard one? Thats what I'd be doing, I don't care if everyone else here goes bankrupt, so long as I've made a little bit back, and you're the exact same.   If I'm wrong, correct me. But everything is now screaming to short.
Lads. I am getting overtaken by FUD
I am sure a lot of you would be as well. I would recommend 1. Turn off your screens. Watch a movie or something. 2. Study more about Finance so in future we are not retards (as much as now). I am doing it now. There are a lot of free courses and you can a lot of basics. Now this doesn't mean you should keep searching for GME / AMC - just the basics or advanced if you'd like.    I am doing number 2 as even though I (personal opinion) feel a lot FUD and I made a mistake and what not bla bla; I would prefer that in future I don't feel this way and all my "bets" are more solid and not as much of a gamble/affected by the extreme manipulation and borderline criminal actions of the "big guys"   Let me know how you guys are feeling? What are your plans?  I will probably buy if it dips at around $50.   From what I see, it seems there might some change tomorrow. But most people are waiting for the data to be released on Tuesday      My positions  28@128 open 10@55 open  45@50 closed
$GME/$AMC SPY inversion
People have been point out the synchronous movements of AMC and GME  for awhile now.  On here, and on Twitter I’ve suggested that it was inverted to the SPY chart which either some people correlated themselves or picked up and ran with my half ass comments. My half assed theory was mainly that MM may be over hedging their position and that the correlation is because AMC/GME have similar beta ratings. If the correlation is true it’s probably because the MM still could have much more money to loose.   I want to say correlation is not causation and it’s irresponsible not to point out that. However, when a fish stinks the head is missing.  Here an example of how a possible correlation might take place.   I notice that there seems to be a lot of large sweeps for ATM the money calls for SPY. These sweeps came in chunks but here’s one that’s open.   390C 3/19 29k O/I premium   mil  SPY    million shares of SPY      They are hedging for   at 50 delta. And that total grows by the number of ATM spy calls with Expiration between now and then.    this is just a half ass explanation for retards to run with.

Any thoughts on it with the Amazon announcement?
CLOV is the New GME Change my mind! Hindenburg, a large hedge fund releases a "scathing report" only to find out its unsubstantiated and they have puts.🤡🤡🤡 Now, Webullers and Redditors are gathering together for the next take down. Screw these hedgefunds, CLOV to the moon!
Question about selling out stock in Canada.
I am just starting to adventure into the stock game after all this GME hype. I did a little research and in Canada if you make any profit when you sell a stock you have to pay %50 of it to your government. This seems like a scam as if you lose money there is little you can do. What ways can I sell a stock and avoid paying such high penalties?
$GME HUGE REVERSAL here's why.
as you can clearly see where price is heading here and it's priced at $      # white line is prior price where price broke resistance and broke out, price is going to retest and see if the demand is strong enough to buy back.    IF PRICE breaks the price line at $    GAME stop is over and has been taken over by   Bears.            RSI 1HR PRICE ACTION SHOWS PRICE RETESTING RESISTANCE    IF THE RSI CAN BREAK THROUGH AND STAY ABOVE ON THE 1 HOUR IT IS SAFE TO SAY A BREAK OUT IS INCOMING.
Now I get to recover again!
WHY GME AND AMC WILL MAKE IT TO PLUTO IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS
Okay, guys, this may get really technical and I know that's the last thing you wanna see, I will use a lot of big words but I honestly think it's worth it to get through this post if you have an hour or two.        So if you look at the volume traded over the last few days you'll notice a trend,        STONKS ONLY GO UP. BRRRRRRRRR
Why Short Interest (SI) could be the same on 2/9
For people who are hanging a lot on the upcoming SI report on 2/9, this is just something you may want to consider. I replied to someone with this comment but have found that I’ve been copy/pasting it a lot because a lot of you guys seem confused about shorts and short interest. So if that’s you, here goes:   “I’ll paint with a broad brush here but imagine that a year ago the hedge funds borrowed the equivalent of 50% of GMEs float to short when it was at 20/shr. (For illustration purposes let’s say that’s 100 shares.) They then sell those shares and collect $2000, confident that when the time comes to return the borrowed shares, GME will be 2/shr, allowing them to buy the 100 shares for $200, return them and pocket the 1800 profit they made originally.   But disaster strikes! A bunch of dumb Redditors band together and invest en masse, driving the stock price up to 100/shr. Meaning that on due date, the HF now needs to shell out $10,000 to cover, putting them at an 8k loss.   But it gets worse. Because these Redditors are MAD. Like, slinging poop at the walls mad. And so the stock looks primed to keep rising like crazy in the near future. What do you do?  Well, if you’re a multi-million dollar HF manager, you devise a dastardly yet overall smart plan: cut your losses and cover your short position at a loss. So you go in and buy like crazy, giving you a substantial loss. But for every short you close, you immediately open a new one to take its place at the current market price, which let’s say is now 200/shr. Now, you’re very confident that these Redditors will eventually go away and the stock will fall back to its position last year at 20/shr.   And now you’re in a position where you’re not pocketing the profit from the stock falling from 20/shr to 2/shr, you can pocket the profits from it falling from 200/shr to 20/shr. Much better position for you and despite the fact that the short interest is still the same, your position is safe because for the “squeeze” to happen, stock would have to be run alllllll the way back up to above 200/shr.   In short, money printer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr for the hedgies, as fucking always.”  TL;DR - SI may very be the same in the 2/9 report but their positions will be very different.
To those who hold
I don't have any experience in stocks or investing but i just wanted to come by and say Thank you and much respect respect for holding the line and sticking it to the rich assholes. even with some of you biting the bullet and taking the loss.     Cheers guys
Little autist brain theory on what’ll happen next week
Alright last week we tapped 500 and then fell to 59 yadda yadda yadda.  But then we got all titlated because we noticed that someone dropped 40 mil on 800$ March calls.  Now here’s what I’m thinking: hedgies will send this up to 500  and slightly above  next week. But because we didn’t sell at $50, they’ll probably hope that we sell at 550 or 600. That ought to make us panic sell, right? Probably no new gorilla blood entering at those heights. It reached these levels before, it might drop sharply again, better grab that profit now...  Except, consider this: don’t sell. Diamond hands it. Let the rage flow through you and just think about setting a limit order in the mid four digits.   If you doubt the reality, just see    Your move, apes.
Motley Fool mentioning $BB as #1 pick right now
Gotta love it when boomers write articles on why the fake thing nobody fell for "fizzled out". (Article from Business Insider)
New Traders please read - in regards to GME, market manipulation & how to move forward.
•  What’s next for GME, do I hold, do I buy more?   - Nobody knows.  Nobody will ever KNOW.  Taking advice from anyone on the internet or in real life, especially when finances are involved is idiotic.  Quickly think about every comment you’ve made pumping GME with rockets and Diamond emojis this month?  Ever wonder why you were doing that?  Because you had a particular interest and benefit of the stock price going up — that’s pumping so you can get the price high enough for you to make money and then leave the others in the dust.  This is the exact thing pumpers are doing to you.  It is VITAL that you stop relying on Reddit comments, start doing research, and put your time to good use since time is in fact, money.  •  The market is so manipulated, it’s completely unfair and the hedge funds always get away with it!   - Yes.  You’re right & that is a healthy and intelligent observation.  The unfortunate truth is this will keep happening.  There are forces at work so much bigger than any of us and if any of you were a part of the top .01% you would also be clinging on to the power and greed of owning the world — or you at least wouldn’t relinquish that power to a bunch of college kids on an online forum.  I love the underdog, everybody wanted a David and Goliath ending to this but it’s just not feasible and it’s time you stop taking your decision to over-leverage and/or fail to take profit,  out on the market.   It is important you begin to study and understand the trends and statistics behind the actual market.  Please, the slightest bit of REAL research could lead to your next play — the one that could save you from this GME mess.  If you learned how to trade options you could’ve bought puts and at least balanced out your losses on your GME shares on the way down instead of just eating those bags.  •  So what, I just sell my GME shares for a huge loss?   - No.  I would never instruct anybody to sell or buy anything.  That’s the entire point of this post.  To encourage others to learn how instruct themselves in the stock market (considering how many of you are completely new & your first trade may have possibly been one of the most volatile in recent history).  Keep your shares, that’s the beauty of shares is that you own them and over time that value may eventually come back, especially if you use other equity to generate enough money to average down your position over time & eventually come out on top.  The only way you will achieve this though is removing GME from your watchlist for a while, studying up & finding new tickers with real promise instead of “short squeeze” opportunities and quick spike situations where you will inevitably be fucked.  •  I used all my money on this last play, I can’t do anything now   - Even if that is the case, I’d hope you still have an income or the ability to collect some money over the next few weeks and months WHILE YOU STUDY.  The perfect opportunity to learn is when you’re forced to watch market action without being able to participate.  You will be able to accurately see trends, and movements without getting FOMO or YOLO-ing in at the top.  Learn about options and you will realize that even $100 can be turned into thousands — I’ve done it multiple times this year (   but the knowledge of trading option contracts and having the ability to make money on green and red days is immeasurable.  Please, I beg of you, go watch a YouTube video or search wsb for a TRUE DD post from a year or two ago in which you’ll learn a ton of shit that can help you.  •  Well the market is closed right now so why does this matter?   • It’s the weekend, get the fuck off your ass and away from DOGGE~DYCOIN and make your time make you money.  Study options, the Greeks (most important THETA) — learn about the indexes; S&P 500 ($SPY), NASDAQ ($QQQ), DOW JONES ($DJIA), and THE VIX — an important indicator of volatility in the market — the VIX ($VXX) can help you determine the direction of the market before it happens, learn it and utilize it!!!  I’m begging you please, this will do nothing but help you and keep you away from $ROPE or   up on the stonk market.  I only want the best for you all so I suggest you drop the retard act for two days to figure out how you’re going to approach this Monday morning.
Mini-Tendies for Bag-Holders
Good Evening Smooth-Brainers  Tonight I have a topic that has come up in the messages I received since my last post several times. I can safely assume that there are about 6million bagholders in this sub now as a result of the insane collapse of GME and AMC over the last 5ish trading days. I sincerely hope this information can benefit at least one of you monkeys.  The topic today is Selling Covered Calls against your shares.   First of all, this only works if you have 100 shares or more. The reason for this is because each call you sell requires collateral of 100 shares (unless you already have a metric shit ton of money in your account and your broker lets you YOLO to your heart’s content).  “But Taco I only have 17 shares of XXX , can I sell part of a call?” What? No. 100 or bust. If you don’t have 100 shares you have two options: buy more shares to get to 100 or keep doing what you’re doing.   This is how it works. I will use AMC as an example as it is more likely to be the stock that you apes have more than 100 shares of because you missed the boat on uber-cheap GME shares. As of 4pm EST, AMC was trading at $  Yeah, that sucks if you bought this 15 or higher, but what are ya gonna do? Cry about it? No way. You got into this biz to make money, not be a chump.  I will be using 15 as the average price for my example below.   Take those sets of 100 shares and make them work for you. Go look at the option chains in RH or whatever trading platform you are using. See there are two columns? Bid and Ask. Bid = Sell, Ask = Buy. Yeah, all these days/months/years you have been buying calls/puts you have been paying the Ask price. Now you are going to jump over to the greener side of the field and sell options to other apes.  (note: you cannot sell options after hours, so you gotta wait until Monday morning, sorry).   So, now that you know what column to look at you are going to sell some calls. Pick the dollar amount you are happy with. If you want to at least break even in the absolute worst case scenario, choose 15. As 15 is pretty far away now, the premium is gonna be fairly terrible, but its your choice.  Once you sell the call you will receive the premium, which is the number in the Bid column. Congrats! You sold a call. Your shares made you a little bit of money. Now sit back and enjoy the ride.  “But what's our max loss?!” Easy. There is no loss. If you sold your options for 15 as I said above, if the stock ends up over 15 by the time the option expires, you will sell 100 shares for 15/share. Congrats you made even money on this trade and you get to keep the premium. If AMC is trading under 15 when the option expires, congrats you keep your 100 shares AND you keep the premium. Then do it all over again next week! Repeat until you lose your shares!  It seems complicated, but it is a fairly straight forward process.  As always I am happy to answer question, just shoot me a message as the comment section has been buggy as heck lately.  (This is absolutely not financial advice)  Jump on board the theta train and let the smaller tendies rain in!  TL;DR:  1) Monkey buys shares of AMC  2) AMC go down. Monkey sad.  3) Monkey Sell call at breakeven or better to make back money.  4) Mini-Tendies!
Have ANY of you left Robinhood? If so question!
When I leave I love seeing like my 3 month or 1 year or all time return   I know some apps when you transfer your investments it’ll start over   I was curious is there any app where say I transfer to fidelity, it’ll keep what my total return was for 3 months, 1 year etc?  Or will it start all over

GME Flair and Filter Please?
Can we get a GME flair and require all GME related posts use it?  Then we could have a corresponding GME filter so that we can tune out all the bagholders and read some DD.  Getting real tired of seeing the same low quality “DIAMOND HANDSSSS WHO ELSE IS HOLDING?!?!” posts.  No one cares if you are holding GME, they just want you to STFU about it and stop drowning out all the other discussion.  Go circlejerk yourselves at /r/GME, don’t ruin WSB.  You’re all going to realize how stupid you look in two weeks when the stock continues to fall.  Can we just speed that up a little?

HIMX - the tendies were nice today...
Thought I'd post some non-$BANG gain porn; HIMX is treating my wife and her boyfriend well this weekend.     Wrote to you smooth brains about this one a while back:     Congrats to all who jumped aboard this rocket ship!

ARKK green thumb just hit $SNAP
Cathie Woods of ARK Investments just bought   shares of SNAP today, five times their DKNG investment and also sold PINS.  DKNG popped 10% the next few trading sessions and counting.  Screenshot from ST:     I’ll be the first to say correlation does not mean causation and history does not always repeat itself in the markets. But come Monday, this could mean good things for $SNAP.   This is coming off a solid and strong ER and some great comments made from Evan on CNBC and during their conference call.  This could be interesting and i also am vested in the situation financially.  Full disclosure, my position:
This looks familiar.
Millions of new members and in the crosshairs of the entire world. A pause to think about the path forward and consider the obstacles as we as a sub move forward
Reposting this just because I tried to get this idea out on a crazy titled post that was removed... but feel it should be thrown up for debate. Or crucifixion more likely. But fuck it.   Here's my sentiment on the current situation of all of us, this situation with GME and whatever.... I feel this merits serious thought so... if anyone agrees lets discuss. Like the intelligent bad mother fuckers we are.   Remember, act like you've been there.   We all should know what we’ve done. Everyone here has now been there. I’m not trying to talk shit for real. I’m just saying that sometimes the real hype and power in your words comes from the cold, calculating and poise inherent to people that know they know what is up, what to do, and how to do it.  If we’re going to thrive as a real group we all need to set examples for the new people here as senior members who have been through it. Think about the long term. We keep our memes and our jokes and our style but it’s gotta be immune to trends and outside influence because we see ourselves as professionals... professional renegades. Autists. Whatever you wanna call it. We need to all reel in the 4 million wild eyed new members and show them the way of WSB. Not for the now but for the future of the sub and the very fabric of the culture we’ve forged in fire here. The GME great short squeeze will go down in history. And it should. But we can’t let our own success be our demise. We can’t give the media and naysayers any ammunition. In fact. When they come here and lurk I want them to report back something somber. That it appears to be the Wild West but once you’re in it for a while you see the beautiful and subtle unspoken rules, respect for innovative ideas, respect for knowledge and respect for those that see an improbable outcome and bet wildly on it and win. Because talent hits a target no one else can and genius hits one no one else can see.  No one saw GME like WSB did. And if they had no other group of people would throw billions at this collective wild ass idea to force into reality what was just a crazy idea like this.  I know this will get downvoted to hell. But the point is to throw your two cents into the machine and hope the butterfly effect is in your favor. Also in that vein I’d like everyone here to consider what effects their own agenda is behind a post and the effect it may have on the whole of the sub. And in turn the lives of those that live and breathe WSB, because for so long it’s not been a group of retards but rather one of the greatest collections of intellectual prowess on the internet. In realizing what we have here I am still amazed. I've been following this sub for about 3 years now and the crazy things I've seen here are nothing on the scale of GME but epic in their own right. The scale of a thing is not relative to the degree of badass it is. We do badass things here all the time if you just look at the DDs and dig into the sub. We all downplay ourselves because that’s the WSB way of being. We don't brag to the point of being insanely opposite most of the time. Hell my girlfriend was flat out appalled when I told her we affectionately call ourselves autists and it's a term of endearment... That's just who we are.  We do not brag. We do not seek to influence others. We all do what we do and at the end of the day love the others here. All jokes aside. Let’s not let GME and AMC take our sights off the long term. And the fact we have to incorporate 4-6? million new members and their ideas and agendas ect.  Now we are weak to outside influence more than ever before at a time when every cocksucker on Earth is setting their sights on us and gearing up the propaganda machines for some social financial engineering experiments that will be, no doubt, some heavy handed and long term projects that are seriously going to be difficult to survive as an 'independent' group of thinkers. For when we cross the murky line from ideas that naturally form here to ideas seeded and nurtured into our psyches and group think no one can see until it's in hindsight. The strongest way to defend against this is to encourage free thinking, intellectual and deep cultural norms that are inherently unwritten such that no imposter or seeded idea can survive the critical minds and crazy ass personalities here much less mimic being one of us... Just like you would know if one of your friends was an imposter because you just fucking know them down to the tiniest little thing, so too should we consciously forge and support this as a group. We should get it going and the new people can assimilate or move on. We should adapt to this new world that we've made, but do it with open eyes and a critical mind because there are serious dangers ahead my friends.    Stop looking outside. The danger is now within. In our own success.
My wife just told me she's pregnant with our 2nd!! 🥳 A) sweet! B) THANK YOU WSB FOR THESE 3M RETURNS! I'm on track to retire early and spend time with my kids 🙂🥲😭

Lessons to be learned from gme
Not a post trying to shit on those who held or are holding gme. I bought gme. I held gme. I held it too late. And I got out at a loss. A pretty significant one.   Even someone like me whose been doing this a few years and is very careful and disciplined can learn a thing or two here. First is you should always take out your initial investment if you are in doubt. I normally do this with most things. If the stock shoots up and doubles really quickly, I pull my initial and play with house money. If it does quickly maybe I sell the rest and buy low or if it stays consistent then I can always buy back in. But this way I don’t lose. I didn’t do this because I bought into the whole short squeeze and the idea that releasing any shares would kill momentum that we all were riding on. Always take out your initial or minimize loss.   Second is don’t take losses too hard. I’ve had and a few downs. Gme was probably one of my bigger downs but it always gets better. Take some time away from investments, clear your head, and get back in there with your new knowledge and learned lessons.   Third is beware of echo chambers and confirmation bias. Everyone in these gme threads are going to tell you what you want to hear (up until recently). The right play is always to hear and acknowledge both sides. Understand what you’re doing and go in when you can prove what you know and disprove what others are saying, to an extent. Now I’ve never been in something this big where the echo chambers were full of so much DD and evaluations and data. It made it hard to see things objectively and realize that a $10 to $500 was probably the squeeze!! Did the hedges and everyone else involved play fair? Hell no. But squeezes don’t just happen because you collectively buy a lot of stock. You can’t just squeeze any stock. A big player has to back themselves into a really terrible position they can’t get out of and have the guts to stick it out while you squeeze them. It’s a very rare thing.   Fourth and finally is you should never put more money in than you are comfortable with losing completely. This is a gamble, even if you do your DD. It can always go wrong for any reason, many which you can’t even see coming, judging by this past week. Always know your maximum loss and assume that’s very possible and likely and make sure you’re okay with that. I think about it as putting in x and then that money disappearing. It never existed for me. Then if I cut my losses.. “Oh look, here’s (x - losses) amount of money that just showed up! I guess I can invest in something else now”   Fifth, do you. If you’re still in gme because you believe in it, awesome. If you’re in it because you really believe in a squeeze, great. You gotta do what you believe in. But make sure it’s your belief that driving your actions and that it’s not you latching on to sentiments from others and trying to fool yourself into believing their yours. Would you still do it if you could no longer discuss it in wsb or on Reddit? Would you still buy or hold? Would you sell? Do you look up your own data and learn about what everything means or do you just believe every little thing that’s posted in an open online forum? Again, you have to decide.   Stay healthy and stress free folks! It’s just money (he says looking at a huge gme loss and crying)
Evidence that shorts are not covering their positions
I would say it was a good month overall 🙂  thanks GME and AMC
Institutional Ownership Increased in 2020 Q4 and Q1 2021 so for for Corsair Gaming CRSR
It's time to load up on Calls and CRSR shares  As can be seen in 2020 Q4 there was 309M of buying from Institutional investors and zero selling . In 2021 Q1 so far Institutions increased there positions buy 24 M, zero selling   Blackrock and JP Morgan are largest shareholders and Pension Funds ,these guys hold long term and never sell.  The company is profitable which is good for growth company . I see it as 5x bagger and price 100 in coming months   Positions - I'm very bullish On CRSR
Just LOL at still bag holding GME
I hear u like GME, so let's talk about Elephants in the Room
I waited a while to post this because tbh i wanted price to fall back to reasonable levels for this DD to make sense. So lets talk about couple of things.     1. Stimulus Checks: Did everyone here forget that there are stimulus checks coming in next couple weeks? Since ya'll smooth brains have short memories, let me remind you what happened last time with stimulus check - PEOPLE BOUGHT STONKS. So what you think is gonna happen this time around? Yeah u guessed it, STONKS. Most of the smooth brains are gonna throw that money into GME to avg down on it. Why? Because we all like the fucking   time we saw stimulus checks of $600 and we all know what happened to stocks like tesla/apple etc and those are not even small companies. Now we have $1400 stimulus checks coming in, and that is very likely to blow up stocks like GME. Dont take my word for it, here's   article on why stimulus money will blow up stock market.    2. Paper hands are gone. They have been torn apart, burned to the ground and most of them are cursing themselves for falling into fomo because they thought they can make quick easy money. Well surprise motherfucker, you're up against the most ruthless people in financial world and this was never gonna be this easy. But the good news is that we are left with ones with true diamond hands. No matter where the price goes, these motherfuckers are not giving up.     3. Lets not forget why the momentum was broken - yeah because of Robinfuckinghood. And that pissed many people off and many immediately started a process of switching brokers. If you remember last Friday, TD/Fidelity customer service were busy as fuck. I imagine most of it was due to the fact that many Robinhood clients wanted to transfer their accounts to them. Now that those transfers slowly going through and accounts are coming back online to trade, many will start buying more. If u liked it at $200, u should be loving it at $50.    4. I think GME's earnings this quarter will be much better than expected. Retail traders favouring to shop at GME because we own the fucking business now is one reason and another obvious reason is how much free publicity they got. I don't have any data on this so if there are any GME employees that can shed light on how business is doing that would be great.  Position: 100 at $72 and will be adding as price moves lower.                 This isn't financial advice, I just like the stock and wanted to share my thoughts.

One thing i dont get about all the Robinhood hate.
What i dont get is why the internet is sending all the outrage at Robinhood and not all the other trading platforms that did the exact same thing?   Or better yet, how about getting pissed at DTCC which  are the ones that upped the colleterial they required, making it impossible for Robinhood to afford to trade GME?  Wallstreet is loving that you guys are all raging at this tiny start up, who exploded in growth over the span of a week and couldnt keep up with increased demand, and ignoring the people that actually caused the problem.
LGBS Reverse merger (Not about any meme stocks)
I have owned a couple thousand shares of LGBS since ‘12(diamond hands still holding strong) Recently I stumbled across news that said they intend to initiate a reverse merger with Global Cannabis Corp. I understand the basic concept of a reverse merger but the more detailed aspects escape me. I have noticed a major trend upwards in the last few days and do not understand the reason for this. Don’t the shares have to be sold at the Global Cannabis Corps offer? Is there something I don’t understand about this?

I think there is a chance we will experiece a crash soon...
I believe we are about to experience a crash. This is because of a few things:  1) housing prices are through the roof. In places like the midwest, many houses which haven't changed in value for 10 years are suddenly up 30-60% in nine months. This level of growth is extreme and introduces uncertainty.  2) All while interest rates are at virtually zero,  our government has printed more money this last year than we have in the last 100 years, they are pushing $15/hour min. wage, politically there is a greater divide than ever before and one party is beginning to shut another down entirely, government spending is so much more recklass than ever before.  3) The market, while I love it, has experience far more upward momentum than it has since the beginning of COVID.   There is just to much uncertainty being introduced on so many fronts. I can't imagine how this couldn't have a disastrous effect on things like futures and derivatives.

GME Fatigue
Disclaimer: I'm not a hedge-fund manager, a big bad banker, or part of Melvin Capital trying to convince you to sell.    Literally any post on the top page is just a pump-up of $GME $AMC for the past 2 weeks.  Is this not getting old?  How many memes / posts of "dIaMoND HaNd$ I'M nOt SeLlInG uNtiL $10,000" can we really enjoy?  It's mainly posts done for quick karma boosts and for desperate attempts to salvage a potentially shitty position because you entered at $400 when you knew jack shit about stocks and now you're experiencing your first loss, and your pea-sized brain thinks that "iF eNoUgH peOpLe seE mY PoSt On HeRe aBoUt GME, My STonk wIlL MoOn".   Bring back some variety and some quality memes.  The Warren Buffet on CNBC interview about his willy type quality.  The way this shit is right now, it should be called r/GMEcirclejerk.  "BuT tHiS iS a HiStorIc MomEnt".  Dude, things like this have been happening.  Ever hear of a stock called Tesla?   In all seriousness, love this sub but I'm hoping we move away from this damn echo chamber pretty soon.    Just some thoughts, I'll take my downvotes now.
I was verbally slammed and eviscerated by a Melbot today.
It took me a long time to recover from the absolute knee to the stomach, karate chop to the neck nature of what has transpired this Friday.  Several minutes ago, I made an innocent comment about the squeeze is not over and hedge funds are manipulating the market.   This is an inarguable statement, as the "s" in hedge funds stands for "short laddering"  .  As retaliation, a hedge shill launched an attack against me.  u/Nungie called me a   bagholder  .  I've been huddled up in front of my screen without it powered on. Just letting myself get lost in the black abyss. Never in my life did I think the vicious rumor that I am a "bagholder" would be broadcast to so many Redditors. I've already received dozens of messages from people informing me that I am no longer welcome on the GME daily discussion thread.  I was at a job interview this afternoon, and it was going great. They pulled the interviewer out of the room to talk, however, and when he returned, he only said, over and over:  "The squeeze is over"  I wound up sobbing and shouting I don't know, I don't know, and they laughed me out of the building. I'm currently with my mom at the moment. She says it'll all be okay and the misunderstanding will clear up soon. I'm not so sure.  I'm going to be headed out for the weekend for vacation (now much needed compared to before), so I won't be able to really do much more than bring this heinous crime to light.     I vow there shall be repercussions if this foul mistake is not cleared up. BIG repercussions.
GME thought I know we're against the shorts, and the squeeze was worth the pain. But is there a second rainbow? Is the company able to pivot?
The company was doing poorly and apparently being smashed by Steam and things like that. Is there a strategy they can follow to turn things around? A downloading service? Other reasons for customers to physically come into store?
GME 500 shares at 57. Should have sold at 90ish and reloaded (Cause thats smart) but yeh
The case for holding GME and the case against it
This entire thing has been crazy. And this sub is different than it used to be, and it will probably never come back. Anyways...    The entire reason to hold GME is the short squeeze. And this revolves around 2 things:   1). The amount of shares short sold   2). The amount of shares being held by retail investors, and so are not on the market being traded.    We have no idea the true values for either of these things. For 1, we have estimates that vary wildly and everyone will follow their own biases on what they decide. And for 2, we will never know but there is good reason to believe as of today, february 5th, its a lesser portion than it was last wednesday-friday. So people holding GME are gambling on these 2 unknown values being in a good proportion to drive the price up.    The only real reason i can see that would say the amount of shares shorted is still very high is this:    Why/when do investors short a stock? When they think it is going down. We all know that by now. So when these hedge funds shorted at $5 or $10, oh yea they were making a risky ass move and paid for it. But what stopped them from covering these and shorting again at $200, or $300, or $400? They probably did, at least to some degree. And theyre well in the money with these shorts.  And they also could have closed these shorts as the stock price fell and continued to go down. Over and over again.    So right now, short interest or the amount of shares shorted might not really matter. It may be really high but you dont know at what price they shorted, and it could be very high. I think this is much more likely than them keeping their original shorts they had before all this.     Something to think about. Sorry to burst the ehco chamber, im guilty in this too. Im just hoping to have a conversation about this and to maybe save a retard who yolod their life savings into this.  So really as far as holding goes, you are betting on things you dont know currently being what you thought they were a week ago. You may be right.
Gonna start eating different nuggets of potpourri to see which one makes me throw up...

OTM vs ITM Leaps
All the people who make a lot of money here seem to be trading leaps. Do you recommend 2 OTM yearly contracts for $500 each or 1 ITM yearly contract for $1000 each. Which is better and why? I notice the delta for 2 OTM contracts seems to allow you to control more shares, but the breakeven is also higher. Do you think this theta decay risk is a major problem? I’m curious what y’all think. Especially the people who trade LEAPS profitably.
Very complex theory I need u guys to know of. (Please. Please read)
I huge portion of me thinks the whole GME short squeeze thing is over. I’m still holding 20 shares. And I’m officially labeling it as dead money. i dont plan to sell regardless of the float this tuesday. BUT LISTEN.   Remember in the movie the big short. How the banks realized the entire housing market was about to crash.   But than manipulated the price of the mortgage bonds to go up. Thus leaving anyone with a swap holding their dicks in their hands.   THEN went and purchased swaps on the bonds they have just sold. I actually speculate that it may be happening with these short squeeze stocks too. because. i feel one thing we can all agree on. was there was mass manipulation going on with these stock prices. and even rn i feel like, if there are still huge shorts open, OR DD shorts as most speculate. why wont the hedge funds go buy a ton on worthless option calls , so when the float comes out and the stock is hyped again. they can axtually be on the profitable side of it... And please dont tell me this is not something they would do. (BTW JUST SPECULATION. NO REAL FACTS TO SUPPORT MY THESIS)   but remwmwber what BURRY said "do u mean that you are ready to price my swaps fairly now that you csn make money on them?"   im just saying. they wont do all this alleged manipulation and fraud if it is not what we thoygh it was. AND i wasnt an OG on this page. i used to stop by here and there for the last yeAr ti see the insane stocks you degenerates yolo on. but never ever. has a stock got me hyped like GME.   PS . it would really suck if im wrong on this one. cuz so far the only stock i have purchased as a bust in my life was ACB a little more than a year ago. i purchased hundreds of securities in my life. and i was never wrong. ever. just acb and potentially this.   it really sucks this happened to most. and that the war we declared on HF's retaliated so hard. but all is fair in war.   WE WERE READY TO BANKRUPT THESE MULTI BILLIONARES. idk how we didnt see this coming.
A summary of the past week
YES!
What is to stop hedge funds from illegally covering their GME shorts, and simply paying a negligible fine of a few million as opposed to hundreds of billions of dollars?
Ok so we all know that hedge funds are bullshit and buddy-buddy with one another as well as politicians, even if they occasionally war with each other as Mark Cuban said.  It seems like Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and everyone else who stood to lose hundreds of billions combined, came together and put a stop to the GME short squeeze.  It seems like whenever these hedge funds commit fraud, they already know beforehand and calculate the penalties into their accounting for the year. A few million, even tens of millions, is chump change for these people. They gain or lose that amount within seconds on the market. These guys stood to lose hundreds of billions if the GME squeeze was successful, but it seems like they have so many tricks and underhanded ways to deal with the squeeze, including some probably illegal stuff that they will just pay a fine for... what gives?
A little bit of DD re: Elon's takedown of Vlad and the ongoing role of Citadel
If you haven't listened to Elon Musk's interrogation, i mean interview, of Vlad the RH CEO then you are missing out. Here's the entire interview both audio and text:     Here's some spicy bits about what happened on day Robinhood sold out it's customers- Jan. 28 Thursday :  >  Vlad Tenev:   And so Thursday morning, so I’m sleeping. But at three thirty   Pacific, our operations team receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation. So basically, as a broker, as a clearing broker, and this is where Robinhood Securities comes in, we have to put up money to the NSCC, based on some factors, including things like the volatility of the trading activity, concentration into certain securities. And this is this is the equities business. So it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything   they gave us a file with the deposit and the the request was around three billion dollars, which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.   >   >  Elon Musk:   So why is this kind of like this seems like like it sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital.

So it’s a big number, like three billion dollars. This is a large number. So basically, the and you know, the details are we don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula, but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is value at risk. And that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things, although it’s not it’s not fully transparent. So there are ways to reverse engineer it, but it’s not kind of publicly   then there’s a special component, which is discretionary. So that’s that kind of acts as a multiplier and basically…   >   >  Elon Musk:   discretionary discretionary meaning, like it’s just their opinion.   >   >  Vlad Tenev:   Yeah, it’s it’s a little bit I mean, I’m sure there’s there’s definitely more more than just their opinion, but basically…   >   >  Elon Musk:   I mean, I guess what they’ve gone through, everyone wants to know whatever it was like, did something maybe shady go down here?

Among other things that Vlad doesn't say but must know is this-  Citadel has huge influence on the DTCC/NSCC - a non-governmental industry consortium which put the demand as was well evidenced by this redditor's post:     Bottom line RH's biggest of all customer Citadel was able to play the Telephone Game to get the message loud and clear to Robinhood.

AMC: Not GME, an insider conundrum, and a ticking time bomb
Hi Everyone,  This post got a lot of great feedback in   so I figured I’d cross-post it here, without the options component and dumbed down a bit for the smooth brains here. For everyone considering an investment in GME's little sister - wanted to open the floor to a few facts and why AMC is not GME and how "big finance" has already dumped on retail investors, and why you should worry about round 2.    1.     You’ve already gotten played and are licking some big finance nuts:    In the midst of this mania, Silver Lake & Mudrick Capital, two scummy vulture investment firms have already blown their load on you and quietly extracted almost   $1 billion   dollars from retail investors and diluted the stock further. See  . These guys are celebrating the best play they've ever made on their yachts in the   right now... to put the size of this into perspective, the value of every AMC share combined was   $500M   two weeks ago.    2.     Most of you are too smooth-brained to understand dilution, so they’re buttering up your butthole for round 2    A lot of you are saying the share price is barely above pre-COVID, so the downside doesn’t seem that bad if you’re bullish about the future of movies… except you’re missing the real story...  The current MARKET CAP (value of all shares) is actually \  what it was, because there are now 3X as many shares, and they’re continuing to use an infinite money glitch to dump more shares on you because you haven’t noticed that and keep buying. It's basically a disguised stock split, where you're actually paying \~$21 to get the same ownership that you would have had pre-covid. See  .   An analogy:  You sell your house in 2007 for 100k. In 2008, they offer to sell it back to you for the same price in the middle of the housing crisis. You LIKE THE STOCK, so you’re seriously considering it, even though your neighbors at Cinemark are down 40%. But there’s another catch – the house now comes with 3 other roommates (dilution) and a mortgage (more debt) now, and they’re trying to sweep that under the rug and sell it to you for the same price anyways    3.     But forget the fundamentals, SHORT SQUEEZE!    I'm weary of debating short interest %'s - I'll just say this - a squeeze is improbable, but not impossible in the short run. What we can agree on – it’s a worse candidate than GME in pretty much every way with more float, less short interest, less concentration of shorts, and more volume. But the story get worse…  Unlike GME, AMC’s already told you that if the prices stay this way, they’re considering   for good.    4.     But wait, there’s more! The insider conundrum…    What might seem bizarre and bullish is that based on the SEC filings to date, the largest insiders have NOT exited their positions yet, unlike insiders at several of the other pumped up stocks. Unfortunately, altruism and optimism are almost certainly not the explanation as share prices are/were still far above what they would've rationally expected for years to come. These insiders are bound by both SEC laws and their fiduciary duty - they can't say no to raising more capital if it's in the best interest of the company... but the SEC won't allow them dump their shares if they're on the verge of diluting them. They're mulling over the capital raise carefully, because doing so would also reduce the value of their stake unless they can put the cash to work in a value accretive way. They're left with two options:  \- Issue more shares and see if they can effectively take advantage of the cash in a way that overcomes dilution ( , buyback, content plays)  \- Wait until enough time has passed for their lawyers to clear them so they can blow their load on you too    5.     The play:   Both of the above will absolutely dilute you and kill the squeeze. I don’t recommend shorting this stock since I’m not ruling out a squeeze entirely in the short term, but this is NOT a game where you can just HODL forever. It's a ticking time bomb. I am/will be loading up on Put Debit Spreads as IV comes down.  tl:dr: AMC is disguised as a a cheaper version of GME, but it's a pump and dump scheme where big finance has already blown their load on you, and insiders are edging right now for round 2.  Disclaimer: This is not investment advice and I am not your financial adviser. Also not an endorsement of GME. But one of these two companies has issued more shares during the mania and has told you they're debating whether to do it again, and that creates a more interesting investment thesis than betting on reddit psychology for the next month. This one also doesn't depend on others joining the cause or holding the line.

An explanation of GME's last few weeks through an analogy.
Imagine you’re playing a game of chess in a tournament. Your opponent has been in the world of chess a lot longer than you and has a suspicious history of winning. However, in this particular game he over-extended himself in an attempt to ~~make a quick buck~~ defeat you quickly. You noticed what your opponent was doing, and, while sticking the rules of chess, you took advantage of his greed and foolishness. You have now cornered your opponent; all he has remaining are a handful of pawns and his king. You still have the majority of your pieces. Your winning of the match is all but inevitable. It’s your opponent’s turn now, and after he moves one of his pawns, he ~~not so~~ subtly knocks one of your bishops onto the ground. He tries to be sneaky about this, but if you were looking at him, it was pretty apparent what he did. It doesn’t matter; even though you’re down another piece, your opponent is still stuck in his predicament with no way out. You move your knight to a position where it will be mate in 3. It’s your opponent’s turn again. He moves another pawn and then knocks your ~~Robinhood~~ knight off the table. Again, as long as you were paying attention, it was pretty obvious what happened. However, the ~~SEC~~ referee of this match wasn’t paying any attention to your opponent. In fact, the ref NEVER seems to be paying attention to your opponent. He doesn’t think he has to. The ref is sure your opponent is just an all-around good dude who pulled himself up by his bootstraps and would never cheat. The ref, if anyone, would know that since the ref and your opponent actually go waaaay back. I mean, he was best man at his wedding and their daughters play lacrosse together. No action is taken, and the pattern continues, and as each ~~day~~ turn passes, your pieces continue to be illegally removed from the board. Your position (pun intended) is beginning to look dire. Taking a glance at the board, though, this makes no sense. It is nearly impossible for the board to have gotten to this state through a series of LEGAL moves. Going by the rules of chess, this game should have been done (or close to it) by now with you as the undisputed winner. Even though you have chipped away at your opponent’s remaining pawns, you are now at a fraction of the number of pieces that you started with, and most of those missing are mysteriously on the ground. Your opponent looks at you and asks if you want to just ~~sell your stocks~~ surrender the game early. At this rate, he says, you’re bound to lose even more pieces before the game is over. You shake your head; there is still hope. Although your pieces have been decimated through means that the ref has turned a blind eye to, your opponent’s king still has not left his corner. He is still stuck! It is at this moment that hordes of ~~hedge fund shills and fake redditors~~ cOmpLeTeLy RaNdOm bystanders come over to spectate your game. They begin heckling you; they are calling you ~~a bagholder~~ stupid for DARING to think you could beat an opponent with such experience. They are vehemently urging you to quit. And their urges are definitely coming from an “unbiased” place since they are definitely “not” ~~simps~~ friends of your opponent. During all of this chaos, somehow more of your pieces were removed from the board even though ~~the markets closed~~ it wasn’t your opponent’s turn. You look at the current state of the board and contrast it to how it was shortly after your opponent got greedy. Sure, it’s a disaster, but you can STILL WIN. It may be much tougher now, but THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL GOOD. The way the game is going it looks like it may end up carrying on for a long time, but you know one thing. You. Won’t. Quit. Whether it be a stalemate or the win you deserve. You won’t give up the game to a cheater.  Fuck cheaters and fuck everyone who hates on GME being a movement.  If you’re here as an investor who is not about this being a movement, THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL GOOD.  If you’re here as a compulsive gambling addict who is not about this being a movement, THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL GOOD.  Hold the line.   ✊    -✊      Feel free to take this and copy/paste it anywhere. With the current state of WSB, I’m not surprised if this gets deleted quickly.

It's not much, but I reached an important milestone today
You need to read this. It's not over. Best DD
Seriously,   read it   \- it's the best DD you will read all week.   \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \   Please credit the original poster u/RubinoffButtChug69  As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke the momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.  Link is    Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.  I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.       Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?    As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.        Per S3, Short Interest was   as of the 27th and   as of the 28th. The net SI is (    This means the net short position reduced by   shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.  Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum,   retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.  To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $  If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened   more short positions. \~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining   positions would be opened between $350 and $480.  This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add \  short positions at an average \~$300. This is assuming   no covering   was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price   went up.    Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only   in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover   positions, and   of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only   could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that   covering would drive the price up, not down.    Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of \  in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add   at an average of \~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.  So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of \~$280, while covering only   at exorbitant costs.  This likely didn't happen, for several reasons.  First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.  Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase.  Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time.  Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was   hard to borrow.    What is more likely is the   inverse   of the above, which would mean shorts covered   shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold   shares at an average of $250, before further covering   at an average of $250.   Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.    That means hedge funds   are not   kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.    Part 2: What About Last Friday?    Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.        Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is   how could it be remotely possible?    S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.     So on Friday there was 50M in volume.   of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (  SI as of the 28th)+(  shares sold short) =   In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as   =   shares.   How do you cover   shares when there is only 50M volume and   of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?      There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most,   shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (  = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.    Furthermore I want to draw attention to   other times shares were covered   and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.    that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from \~69M to \~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an >100% increase.  They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally   exponential growth   in the share price   despite no change in SI  . But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?  There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of >31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price?    Part 3: How Could They Do It?       Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered   when they have not    There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.  Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also   did not   shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position.  They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.  TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

Did Robinhood screw you ? Did it seem unfair when their CEO said on live TV that they didn't have liquidity issue yet he banned trading in the name of preparedness for liquidity ? Why couldn't he work on getting liquidity without banning trading ? Here is how to -official- transfer out of RH
manipulative and work-for-rich-screw-the-powerless sh\ t job done by Robinhood.  Liquidity is needed by brokers. Agreed. But...  Robinhood had enough and were already planning to raise. And they did raise $1B in a couple of days. So they were working on getting credit, didn't happen overnight.  Hedge funds were not going to have to close short positions within those two days. So Robinhood banned retail traders from buying. why ?

Melvin is a private player but how to fix SEC? My idea is to put recall laws on SEC director and other big positions and put trial by peers of jury over them, in fact put Recall laws and Jury over all Federal, Province and Local level over all government positions to make investing a fair game!
So I see that people are blaming Melvin Capital and other Hedge funds but they are Private companies what what about SEC, who supposed to work for us and they are sell out for these big guys, how to fix SEC? Let’s share ideas guys - mine is to put recall laws on SEC director and other big positions and put trial by peers of jury over them, in fact put Recall laws and Jury over all Federal, Province and Local level over all government positions to make investing a fair game! What are your suggestions?
Too late to join the frenzy?
Hi everyone. I’m blown away by the success of this community. I feel like maybe it’s too late for me to jump in on getting GME stocks, and I have zero experience with stocks, but I’ve always been interested, so is there any hope? I’m only considering this now because I’m in a serious bind myself, and I don’t have a lot of other good options at my disposal. If the ship’s already sailed, then it is what it is and I’ll just have to figure something else out to pull myself up. Regardless, I’m rooting for you all in your battle against Goliath! This is some of my favorite history to see unfolding.

IM NEW and leaving WallStreetBets (hear me out)
OG WSB is right: us brand new baby fucks are making this sub toxic. And retarded to unprecedented levels (which is saying something).  Let’s be real, we’re the goddamn flat earthers of the investing world. Leave these retards have their big boy fun, and flock to the subs dedicated to your meme stock of choice. I for one, will leave. I’ll learn without the influence of chanting, echo-chambered empty words (or emojis). I’ll be back when I know wtf I’m talking about. Let them have their WSB back.  Edit: you don’t have to leave, but at least ease down on new posts every stupid minute asking « who’s still holding [diamond hand emoji, ape emoji]!!! » Y’a know? Is that fair?
If nobody is selling why does the price keep dropping?
I understand that HF are pulling tricks like short ladders and more. But if we are all holding shouldn’t the stock stay up in price?. I’m sure there are some paper handed bitches tho.
Buying is the best thing you can do right now
At any time to build the economy pumping the system with money is always a good thing, especially now that the government is pouring money in. THat is a good faith measure if I've ever seen a sign. On the other hand it could be the precursor to the next bubble popping. Those bets are called shorting but even those don't win in the long run.
Day trade analysis partner needed
Im a data analyst by trade and brand new to stock, but Im mesmorized by this new discovery that if you hit the buy button when the little line is going up and sell right after it starts going down, your computer gives you free money.  My intuition is that in the short term,  this behavior is less governed by the financial merits of the company, and more by predictable patterns of human behavior (ie other WSB idiots on other computers trying to do the same thing).   Is there anyone else intetested in exploring this idea with me. Ideally, someone with the market experience to help explain things to my dumb butt, but could benefit from my abilities with advanced Excel stuff.  Coulld be a group if there's enough interest.  Edit: grammar
I paperhanded...
But then bought them back 2 hours later for the same amount because you got my retarded brain going again! LETS GO APES!  TO THE MOOOOOON!!!
From +25k to -26k to +4k above my break even (you can guess what happened there...) just to hold on to GME and AMC.
We made it through the week
It was a tough week but we made it and are ow up from yesterday which is super important. Everyone take a break from this sub over the weekend. Go for a run, eat/sleep well. Doom and gloom was rife but I think we have hit an important psychological barrier and the trend is now up. Morale in the sub is definitely up from a few days ago, we will succeed
First amendment??
Fuck it I’m just gonna sell...
All my fucking belongings to buy more $GME!! I’m an absolute retard, but I’ll finally be with my own people when we make it to fucking Pluto!!!       Edit: I’m responsible for my own investments. I don’t want advice from shills and paper handed bitches! Thanks!  Edit 2: for my fellow degenerates that truly are concerned, no I’m not selling all my belongings, and I’m not risking my entire future. This post was originally meant to troll non believers as well as boost the morale of my fellow HOLDERS!  GameStop has a very close place in my heart as I lurked the racks and demo consoles regularly as a child and teenager.  Edit 3: Last one! HODLing strong 18 @ ~$270  FOMO will be the end of me   Apes strong together! Can’t stop, won’t stop, mother fucking GameStop.
Maybe I’m a tard
but I love GameStop, always have. It’s probably one of my life most visited websites. Other than prn. But look hbo is making a movie and who knows what else. GameStop is going to be a name in the history books now because of this, when people look back it’s going to be the “Reddit thing” / “oh you mean the GameStop thing?” So look the stonk is down but I still like it and I have faith that the company will have an outstanding few years given all the news they have had. Free advertising.
GME is Still Worth Holding Even if there isn’t Another Squeeze.
After all that’s been said and done, you’re just apart of me I can’t let go. TLDR at bottom.   Regarding GME, worst case scenario is that the shorts report on the 9th and it all goes tits up. Whatever, maybe we don’t get 10k a share. Doesn’t change the fact that it was a solid play. The rules got turned off on us and no one saw that coming. Crazy volatility ensues. That’s why silver went up btw. Because people thought the market was insolvent and wanted to stack precious medal just in case the market exploded - there is money to be made off the panic, but I digress. Let’s say we missed the ship, This doesn’t change the fact that if you’re in now, there’s still reason to hold  GME.   The GME stock craze was like an adult tickle me Elmo phenomenon. America loves this shit, and we need a national feel good narrative now more than ever. The story alone  is worth enough to have two movies already in production about it. A corporate underdog movie of this magnitude has never been done before. It’s gonna make GameStop iconic.  GameStop HAS to survive now. It’s too marketable to lose.  It’s not out of the question for GME to have a comparable value to let’s say,  TTWO which is a $200 stock in the video game industry. Depending on how they capitalize on their new situation. I’d have to imagine that GameStop has a few new options available now.  GameStop could pivot to streaming or some shit and change the face of Videogaming into the future.  They could build an E-sports stadium or build a  team that will be worth what the Yankees are worth in 2031.   I’m just saying, video games are only getting bigger and are at the forefront of technology and GameStop is an important Institution.  I don’t think America wants to see another Blockbuster situation. I just like the stock I guess.   This is obviously stupid and it’s important to know I’m not a financial advisor. I’m just a silly little stink that loves pudding.   TLDR: GME could capitalize off of national sentiment and organically earn a $400 a share value.... eventually.
This guy gets it.  🤲 why all the BS if they arent still losing/lost money. Fuck you holds are my favorite. I really like the stock
Chamath supported GME and WSB, and now his $CLOV is being shorted.
Chamath is one of the biggest supporter of GME, which leads to the stock price from below 100 to 150 before Musk joined. And because of this, he is being attacked by short company and they are shorting his $CLOV.
Would like to discuss two investments not called GME or AMC... But rather-
CCIV, & VGAC  $CCIV is rumored to merge with the likes of Lucid motors to complete with Tesla by producing 400,000 EV Cars this year $VG is an interesting blank check company that's merging with 23&me  Pretty new to this, but trying to research, and not buy hype.. So has anyone else seen this in news or anything else interesting that's not a meme stonk
Should I buy GME now? Is the dip over?
Half hour into an Alison Wonderland Show and the fam is HODLING HODLING HODLING!!!!!!
Ouuuffff. Holding till December
Do we need more hype for this too work?
How do we get back the hype to GME? I feel that after the major manipulation that we saw for the past few days it has pushed away many apes from the community. We need to get GME trending in social media to bring more attention back to this.
This subreddit has never been a stock-pumping subreddit
If you’re depending on others to invest with you in order to gain a profit, then you just might not be investing in the right things.  The stock market isn’t a team sport, and there are other things to talk about rather than nonstop $GME and $AMC pushing.  It seems that the entire identity of WSB has been consumed by a get-rich-quick mentality.
Next Bets?
What are you going for next? I haven’t picked yet. Didn’t join the squeeze, but looking for the next hot stock. Already missed COVID vaccine stock. Who’s in the space for capitalizing on continued quarantine? Or who is the first to blow up after these are done?
WSB is springing back to life, we can do this guys. Hold and buy the dip for a trip to the moon!
I don't know what happened earlier this week but there was alot of negativity here and while my diamond hands didn't shutter (I'd ride that shit to 0 just to say I did and brag about it like the retarded ape I am), I was worried about the future of this new financial movement that was created here. It seems just today the mood here has turned around for the better and I'm excited for next week. Us common people have a chance to make a better life for ourselves and I know many including myself are ride or die as long as there is the tiniest chance of this happening. I want to buy a house and get a history degree, we all have things in our lives we want to happen. Right now, this is the way.
Still holding! If you are panicking, remember you aren’t alone and selling at this point is pointless and dumbest thing to do! I keep holding AMC & GME
Microvision YOLO update! I really like this stock! Perfect justification for buy and hold.
$AMC and $GME tight correlation is not proof of manipulation
You clowns are looking at correlation charts of GME and AMC like it's blatant market manipulation.  They are tightly correlated because the same fucking apes are buying both. Holy shit this sub is full on fucking inbreds at this point
Everyone is sharing so I thought I would as well. Still holding because I like this stock, I am a Stubs member and still play video games            Weird how those emoji are just right there now
A little due diligence saves face
I know everyone here is pretty low on the brain power spectrum but that being said I think we all know how google works if not I'll link it. Just type whatever your heart desires in the little box and hit search!      That being said spend 5-10 minutes at least if you are going to make a post or send a reply know what the heck it is you are talking about. I've seen a ton of posts and even been replied to with blatantly ill informed people. If I can find a rebuttal in less then 5 minutes your comment was a waste of my time and everyone else's. Stay well informed and provide actual content here were trolls yeah but there is a little more to WSB than strictly trolling bring something to the table thanks guys and girls.
Want to boost morale with a give away.
Last semester in college and it was gonna be the first time I wasn’t going to have to work full time.
Welp. First shift is tomorrow. Thanks GME
How Can We Trust the Report on Tuesday?
I’m just a retard with 43 GME shares @ 160; I don’t know why, with all the other manipulation that we’ve witnessed, we can trust the report that comes out on Tuesday as true?
There is no way the normal mods are back.
This sub is a fucking disaster. The amount of posts about holding gme and amc is out of control. We get it, you're holding, we don't need 500 posts a day about it.  Am I the only one that sees this sub has been completely derailed?   Honestly starting to consider that the HF are in here and they are now longing GME and just trying to build the hype back up with 5000 of the same fucking post. Mods never would have allowed this chaos a month ago.   Can any mods chime in on the state of affairs in here?
It's easy to hold when you're down. When I was up $200k I didn't   . Keep holding.

Thoughts on Robinhood IPO?
I just find the whole concept weird. I realize Fidelity is traded. Weird to think Fidelity ever limiting the buying of its own stock. Can brokers sell their own stock?  EDIT: I learned Fidelity is not publicly traded. EDIT 2: Would RobinHood be the first one?
With all of the discussion of shorts lately, wouldn't a company that sells stools and ladders such as Lowe's be a good stock option?
Listen, it’s easy
The problem with billboards.
I keep seeing posts of people buying up billboard space. I don't get it. 99% of the people who see it will have no idea what the balls Diamond Hands, To The Moon, or even $GME means. I just feel like it is a waste of money. Unless you are buying in Times Square, put your money elsewhere.
Late to the party, but prepared to hold
It's taken me 2 weeks to digest this opportunity, sign up to a brokerage, deposit money and buy 3 shares in GME because i am what doctors describe as, mentally retarded. But like you, I will not let my disability get in the way of sound, unverified advise on the internet. Diamond hands till $10,000 or i'm eating moon dust in my bran flakes!!!

If I downgrade from a margin account to a cash account in Robinhood, will that trigger any margin calls I owe to pop up?
Want to get them out of the way but I don't know how to trigger them. It says I haven't used any margin but I've seen people try to transfer their accounts out of Robinhood, it gets rejected and sent back to Robinhood, only now their margin calls are triggered and they owe all this money, even though it said they hadn't been using it.  Robinhood then locks them out of the account, preventing them from even being able to pay the calls, and Robinhood liquidates their stocks to pay for it. Trying to avoid that if possible. Thank you

AMC flooded the market with shares?
Why isn’t anyone talking about the recent dips being an effect of AMC dumping   million shares to stabilize themselves on Monday?   This is not financial advice. Just an ape looking for more bananas.
$GME remains #1... The “N” is falling off “BANG”... $CRSR is up from #18 to #7 going into the weekend on wsb.
SLAM. Let the boys be boys. Steroid aficionado and Jenny from the block want in on the SPAC market.
This SPAC market is so jacked up right now A-Rod is  issuing a new blank check company that is looking to raise $575 million to merge with a sports/media or wellness company. This market is so fucked. Add to this the fact they got God damn Ja Rule on CNBC talking about stocks during this whole GME debacle. We are truly in unchartered waters right now. Tread carefully. Up those cash positions.
Any interest in BMBL
Every single woman I know who uses dating sites uses the app Bumble. The IPO is happening on the 8th and they're targeting the 28$-30$ range  (I'm sure they'll open at a much higher valuation).

Stash Still has my purchases as pending
So I’m new to the game and I started using stash I tried to buy the stocks about a week and a half ago and it still has them as pending transactions what am I doing wrong please help
Important note... this sub is slowly returning to non-GME DD, and you need to keep in mind we have 9 million members
With the majority being new, you have to understand the possibility that this sub is compromised from the outside in. If we really have been seeing bots lately, why would they stop at stopping one particular rally?   Why wouldn't these same players just switch tactics? Maybe start posting rosey, but misleading DD to inflate a stock, or spam buy/sell sentiment to spark a mob.   I can't say this will be a legitimate problem, but with the attention we've gained, someone is bound to dip their toes in and make an attempt to manipulate us.   All of us, new and old have to learn, and fast to do your own research and not just hop on and repeat things you heard someone say.
There are algorithm bots combing youtube thumbnails that auto-target the "mascot" image which paste text trying to dissuade people from investing.
I recently used the wallstreetbets guy in a thumbnail for a video of mine that had nothing to do with investing, the subreddit, or anything gamestop related. It's simply a "tips and tricks" video for a crappy MMORPG. Here's the image:      I've been getting comments from bots that I assume scanned the thumbnail with an algorithm and are completely off-topic with my own video and just info-dump a bunch of random crap about investing. I've been heavily moderating it and removing the off-topic posts that have nothing to do with the actual video but here's a snippet of the kinds of posts I get. They're usually just a few paragraph info dumps. (The text cuts off cause it's the notification preview window and not the full comment.)       I wonder how much money these fatcat hedgies are burning trying to astroturf literal MMORPG guide videos. I find it quite kek but I thought you guys should know what's going on.
Don't loose it guys!
Short Ladder Mathematics
I've seen several posts refuting the possibility of "short ladder attacks" but I think they all make the same fundamental mistake - they assume that an institutional investor does not have the money to create the volume necessary to move the price. I don't buy that, and here's why:  Let's look at the 1-minute interval beginning at 12PM last Friday. During that minute, 170k shares were exchanged, and the price dropped from about $64 to $62. I can't access the historical order book for that time, but in general, order books follow a gaussian distribution about the mark price, with 95% of all orders within +/- 5%. So at exactly 12PM, we could expect the order book to have bids for 60k @  , 20k @ 65, and 5k @ 66+. Likewise, you'd expect asks for 60k @  , 20k @ 63, and 5k @ 62-.  In order to naturally drive the price down, an investor would need to have 85k shares in the first place, and sell them all for as little as $62. The argument I've seen against the viability of short ladder attacks is that shorters don't have the shares to begin with, and they couldn't afford to blow $5M every minute all day.    But there's another way!   Rather than driving the price down naturally, a participant with access to high-frequency trading can  literally wipe the order book  and pick the price it wants for the given interval. Specifically, they  buy  all 75k asks and nearly instantaneously turn around and  sell them for a loss . This costs them 75k times the average difference in price, in this case about $150k. This is much more sustainable, and can be arbitrarily activated throughout the day. In fact, the cost to manipulate the mark price up or down by $ X  per share during an interval with volume  V  is approximately  X     V  / 2. Couple this with some well-timed FUD and momentum psychology, and it seems entirely plausible that a relatively small actor could manipulate the mark price of a stock significantly.
Your a retard if you sell amc tomorrow
I know theres been a lot of talk about people selling at cutting there losses but selling amc tomorrow makes no sense. The short % report comes out Tuesday and that would tell us if  if a squeeze is still possible. Youve been bullish and watched your portfolio drop for this long, why sell now, your wifes boyfriend wouldnt be very proud. Also if its any consolation theres been rumours of amazon buying out amc and the stock price will go back up after covid is in control so long term your not gonna lose as much and may make a profit depending on where you bought.  BTW not financial advice just a retard with 64 shares of amc at $ , if you need the money for rent or cant risk it (you shouldnt be investing money you cant afford to lose) sell.
DD: How the short interest report for GME and other stocks on Feb 09 could be falsified, and why YOU should pay attention.
Disclaimer 1:   I'm a novice. I'm informing you of what I'm aware of, and what I know of. I would extremely appreciate it if commenters can post some DD or any related facts on the topic.     Disclaimer 2: This is based on my current understanding, which may be incorrect.     If you object to any of the points I make, please make them clear in the comments and state why.       Disclaimer 3:   I'm not a financial advisor, and this is my PERSONAL opinion.     Disclaimer 4:   This post is making the assumption that you already believe, or at least believe in the possibility, that hedge funds have not covered and the squeeze has not squoze. If you don't, just see the hundreds of DD's floating around on this topic. Here's the most recent one I read by           Disclaimer 5: If you disagree and think the squeeze has squoze, then I really have no idea why you're wasting your time and energy reading this and posting negative comments with your paper hands.

For example, NASDAQ references the use of FINRA as the source of their short interest [\      >"Member firms that have short positions in OTC equity securities and in securities listed on a national securities exchange, such as NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, Cboe BZX, and IEX, must file a Short Position Report with FINRA via the Web-based system"  [\   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # What is my concern?  My concern lies with the potential of firms to inaccurately report their short interest levels to FINRA. From my understanding, it is the short investment   firms   that send these reports to FINRA, and not the company itself \[Gamestop\].  What is the reasoning behind my concern?   It is the penalty/fines for frauding the short interest that is the issue.   In the most simple terms: The amount fined is extremely low.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # Some examples of fines in the past:     >FINRA fines NOMURA   $300,000   for violations of short interest [\    >   >FINRA fines Barclays Capital Inc.   $125,000   for failure to accurately report short interest positions[\    >   >FINRA fines Morgan Stanly & Co.

If you haven't been living underneath a rock the past two weeks, you should know about all the market manipulation going on for GME. All the short ladder attacks against GME by hedge funds, all the media manipulation, the brokerages restricting GME orders and plummeting the price, the immense failure-to-deliver orders on GME; There's honestly way too much to list.  Hedge funds are spending millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, every single day for these strategies and to pay off the interest on their expired short interest and failure-to-deliver positions.  Do you really think they wouldn't pay a million-dollar fine in order to save billions on their short position?  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # Get your tinfoil hats ready  A lot of people are waiting on the February 09th date to decide what to do with their GME stock positions. We will probably see the wildest price fluctuations on the 9th, whether it soars or plummets. I know, I know, most people here will HOLD GME to the god damn ground. But unfortunately, a lot of people are looking at the February 9th date to understand the situation.  And Hedge funds should know that.  They should be aware that, if the Feb 09th report is accurate, it will show their short-positions. It will rally the stock again, and it will soar to the moon. At that point, there isn't much they can do to manipulate the stock. Everyone will know they lied to the media about covering their positions, and won't believe a thing they say. Everyone will have moved on to a real brokerage by then and can execute trades again.    So why haven't they covered yet?    In my eyes, there are three possible reasons why they haven't covered their position yet.  1. They're waiting for the February 09th date. After the short interest report is released (and it inaccurately shows the low short-interest due to fraud) there will be a huge selloff in the next few days. They will probably cover their positions a few days/week after February 09th: as the GME stock will have had plenty of time to react and fall in light of news of the fraud short-interest. At some point, the increasing interest in their expired short-positions and failure to delivers will outweigh the decreasing GME stock, and they will cover. They would also want to sell this before FINRA catches wind of this, and publicly announces that there was fraud regarding GME short interest (I personally think it takes FINRA a while to discover these things, so don't count on it. But GME might be an exception they're eyeing due to all the attention surrounding it) 2. They're going to cover on February 08th, before the news is released. They will use everything they have left at their disposal, all the media attacks, the short ladders, EVERYTHING. They will bring the price as low as they possibly can, and close out their positions towards the end of the market day. If we see huge downwards movement tomorrow despite low volume, this is probably what is happening. 3. They are somehow clueless that the short-interest report on Feb 09th will cause a retaliation of the stock, and increase the volume. The stock will rise immensely within days, and they will be caught with their pants under their ass. The paper hands will again see their opportunity, and join back into the stock as the price keeps rising  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # What should you do?  If the short interest report comes out, and you believe, based on your DD and research, that the short-interest levels simply don't match up to what they should be: You should   HOLD.      HOLD   through the crash.   HOLD   through the FUD.  The shorts will cover a few days/week after Feb 09th, and there will be a very indicative spike in volume and price. This will also probably be followed with momentary confused hype around the stock for a few days, further increasing the price. Keep an eye out for these days!!!  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # TL;DR  There is a possibility the February 09th release of Short-Interest info will be fake, frauded. This is because the fine/penalty for reporting false information is EXTREMELY LOW (anywhere from 100k to 2 million on average in the past). Hedge funds will save BILLIONS by taking that measly 1 million fine. They already are spending millions every day on interest for their expired short and failure-to-deliver positions, short ladders, media manipulation, etc strategies.  Be prepared to HOLD through this. Expect them to cover their positions after a few days/week after the rising interest cost of their expired short position and FTD > the continued decreasing price in GME  At the very least, just read the "So why haven't they covered" part of my DD so you know what MIGHT happen in the next few days and what to do.
Anyone else upset that DFV likely won’t be posting on his YT too much after the dust settles? Wish I would’ve found him sooner
This dude is unbelievably smart and just such a genuine and charismatic dude. I’ve been watching his videos and old streams for hours on end and I just wish I would’ve found him sooner since due to legal pressure I just can’t imagine him posting anywhere near the same frequency. He’s one of those gems of financial education online (like Graham Stephan for example) and stresses the education of his content so heavily and you can just tell he cares so much (also he’s so good at walking through it all). I figure this post won’t do too well, but was just curious of how others who have also watched his content felt.  Positions: PLTR 36C 3/12  Edit: His channel is “Roaring Kitty”, this was known before the doxing of him btw but I still had hesitated at first
Y'ALL STILL OUT THERE?
This might be the best time to inverse WSB
The sudden change in sentiment on this sub is insane. We went from "THE SQUEEZE IS NOT SQUOZE YET $69,420 IS NOT A MEME" to "lmao fucking loser bagholders imagine buying in at $330".   I don't buy it. I don't buy any of it. It's all fucking SUS.   call me crazy, call me a bagholder. I don't give a retarded fuck. In the past even when people made retarded plays and lost money, both sides still took it in stride. Now its like, "hey lots of people lost money, look how genuinely stupid and bad they are at investing. Let's even downvote them if they express their thesis we don't agree with, because haha why not."    WTF? When wallstreet  BETS   become r/stocks???      something is fishy     I've seen bots on both sides. I've seen mods get removed. I've seen actual DD posts getting deleted, and random shit getting censored.   And now suddenly everyone is posting their gains? Bull fucking shit.   The "third parties" have got this sub exactly where they want, and we're being played like a fiddle.   Buy, sell. Do whatever the fuck you want.    (btw I'm not even salty because I sold my calls on the way up and even if GME goes to $0 I still have a profit. Fuck all you apes lacking balls).     TLDR:   I'm inversing this place and holding until something happens. sincerely fuck you all.
When you hold $GME from $40, the feels
GME gain. I’m still in disbelief. Withdrew $30k and one big step closer to being debt free. 36 years old and married, no car payments now.
For some perspective, GME’s ATH before the squeeze was $61 in 2007, when the company was showing record profits and expanding store locations.
Surge coming F O R D
Forward Ind.  entered a six-year deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars with Alphabet. Ford also named Google Cloud as its preferred cloud provider for its entire ecosystem. Edit: A new revenue stream IS coming  ;-)  Watch closely losers but you bet get on this
Woof!
What are are your thoughts on WOOF now that it's public again?
Last week I was a 📝🤲🏳️‍  . No regrats.
My fellow retard brother uncle told me to by AMC
PSA: if you're doing a thing that might not be legal, don't talk about it on this or any public forum.
If you even have a whiff of gray legal gas, don't fan it over here, bro. Google it, ask someone privately, or just write about it in your diary so your grandkids can read about what a dumbass you were. Reddit is not nearly as anonymous as you might think, even if you use your free trial VPN you got with a spoofed debit card.
The current short volume is up 163% from previous month. Current price is   most likely will hit 5$ within this year. What do ya’ll think? Get a bunch of apes together and cop up like they’re hotcakes and stick it to the hedge funds who have been betting against it.
Thank you wallstreetbets. And 1 advice/conclusion
I just want to thank wsb for the gains i had.. And i want to say what i learned:      Never tell someone you know irl about your investments. If you loose money, people are assholes. "I told you blabla". If you make gains, people are also assholes. They are envy because you made it and they dont. Either way, ive learned, just keep it for yourself whatever you do.      I told 1 person, he should buy gme (monday 2 weeks ago). We both bought at   He sold to early. Then he bought again at 300. Also he told like 5 persons they should buy the stock to. All of them lost, while i made a life changing gain.      Now they all hate me. They are to dumb to make their own dd or they have no balls or whatever. But they blame me now.     My conclusion is: i will never tell someone again something about stocks. I am a suit guy, i sell life insurances for a living since many years. A negative feedback from a costumer is rare for me, very rare. But when people loose money on a stock, they will blame you for it. They will blame you and it will never be the same again with those people.      I love you all for beeing retarded autist apes. Thank you for changing my life in a positive way. Im still holding 250 shares of gme btw.      I also think/feel the real short squeeze will come in the near future. I somehow know and feel the whole thing is not over yet.      Last: thank you swissquote (swiss broker) that you, different as robinhood et al, did not manipulate buy orders of any stock, ever.
What do you think the next big thing is?
I'm very curious as to what everyone thinks is going to be the next stock to boom.
RH getting desperate!
Anyone else have eyes on SCR? Thoughts?
Been keeping my eye on them for a week or two now, just curious if anyone has any thoughts or experience in companies that run off "Gambling". Suggestions? Looking for positive and negative stand points.
PAY TO LEARN, or be weird and learn from the fault of others
These past few weeks have been very reminiscent of March imo, and I think anyone who was around then knows what I’m talking about...  If you don’t, know their was a lot of similarities:  Everyone hopped on the same train except the execution was essentially the opposite,( 🧸) and almost easier.  You could literally pick any company, I mean like, ANY company; and from the start of March to the end you basically couldn’t miss, just throw a dart and buy a weekly put for that company, up 300% in two days.  (FIRST ONES FREE)  Everyone made a lot of money fast, some got out but a lot of others, me included! Tried to double down and got absolutely wrecked. My account went from 30-70-115k, then on 3/24 I doubled down and was back to 60k 3 days later, and finally sold on 4/2 for 30k...  Went into a huge depression, tried to win it all back just as fast, but continued to go up and down. mostly down , until July solidifying a  50-70k loss across different accounts.   I’d like to say I learned a lot, and basically I hope u read this and learn quicker then I. Whether you won or lost this past month.  RESPECT THE GAME  understand what you are doing.   DONT TAKE OTHERS WORD AS LAW, if they were that good they would b running a fund...  Still Try and learn from everything, just take with a grain of salt  And if your down, Don’t kill your self! life goes on, death doesn’t. Call someone or message me    POSITIONS, at the moment:  $PLTR $FUTU (shares & options) $AAPL (shares & options) $ETWO $PSTH  (personal favorite) $and others I’m embarrassed about.   I have pictures in recent posts to show proof but can repost if ur heart desires
Lmao GTFOH
Year of the rat ends on the 11th of Feb. It is the reason for the crazy year we have   that day everything will be back to normal.
I LOVE HOLDING GME
I love holding GME and I am so excited to hear future news from Ryan Cohen! ESPECIALLY knowing these MM's will have to buy a FUCK TON of GME shares and WE GOT IN BEFORE THEM!! I will continue adding on dips, dollar cost averaging, and accumulating shares. I have no doubt that future hype will come and additional shareholder interest will develop because the future of Gamestop is looking BRIGHTER THAN EVER!!!
GameStop shares halt slide after Robinhood lifts trading curbs
Random question for someone new to wsb - is the avatar supposed to be Leo from Wolf of Wall Street ?
Hello fellow investors, it’s time to bail!!! Papa Musk would agree!!!!
Hey fellow WSB investors, it time to bail out of the stock market. Early this morning I saw a news article from Tesla that they had invested in a certain company. I can’t mention in this post because auto mods take it down. So long story short, as retail investors, everyday we are manipulated, played and our accounts wiped clean from shorts.  Hedge funds are killing our calls and puts and using shorting to ruin our portfolios.  When we go to fight back we are restrained by the very companies we use to buy our portfolios.  This system is rife with corruption.  We can’t win against the big hedge funds, but there is a way to make them pay and that’s to not  even play.  If we all jumped into the BC and EU like Tesla did yesterday, we can push the price to infinity. It’s the new revolution for the new investors.  Forget about calls, puts and stocks.  It’s time to move on to bigger and better things that can’t be manipulated . And that’s Why it was created.  Bigger returns, less stress, and backed by our boy!! As long as you are not weak with volatility you will be more successful in the future of this revolution.  Tell me I’m wrong. Btw watch the bots and the shorts comment on this, it will be fun.
Me looking for that GME squeeze I keep hearing about
Is the optimism towards GME and AMC still realistic? I mean I am holding because like most I am at a loss and feel that I have nothing left to lose.
As much as I appreciate the optimism of this group that GME and AMC will go to the moon and beyond, I wonder sometimes if it is just blind optimism that keeps a lot of us hopeful that it would do so.  I know a lot of people posts graphs, trends, etc to backup their theories and claims.  But just like a lot of the rubes who joined the group after the GME stock surge, I really don't know what I am looking at and take the word of a stranger that everything will be all right.    I have lost about $4500 which was a big chunk of my savings and blame nobody but myself for gambling on the stock market and the gamble didn't payoff.    In a way, I feel like a lot of people feel the same way I do and I know and expect to get a lot of crap on this post, but I do want to hear from people who feel the same way I do and what you're next move is.    For what it's worth... I am not a bot who is trolling people who are unsure of what to do next.  I am a real guy who is just wondering if I should just accept my loses and move on.
Pure memes only
While you were busy arguing about GME, I studied the blade. Daddy Elon is using it. Mommy C. Wood is buying it. Grandpa Gamma wants to squeeze it. You need to try it.
What is ‘the blade’ you ask? It is the sword that we live and die by. It is the ultimate high-risk, high-reward investment.  What if I told you that there’s a single company, currently valued at       trillion dollars, that has an actual possibility to grow into a       trillion dollar market cap company?  Let’s look at the companies it can steal money from:    It’s a social media replacement. FB is worth 763 billion.    It’s a Zoom replacement. ZM is worth 122 billion.    It’s a podcaster’s paradise. SPOT is worth 58 billion.    It’s a personal trainer platform. PTON is worth 43 billion.    It’s a dating app platform. MTCH (maker of tinder) is worth 42 billion.    It’s a language learning platform. Rosetta Stone and Duolingo are worth about   billion.  Add that all up and you get     trillion dollars.   That’s 100x the company’s current value. Will it get all the way there? I don’t know. This isn’t WallStreetFinancialAdvice.  Oh, I forgot:    They also do telemedicine or some shit (literally worth an arm and a leg).  What company are we talking about? Agora (ticker: API).  Do you remember when Gmail was invite-only? You should have invested in GOOG back then.  Do you remember when FB was invite-only? You should have invested in FB back then.  Guess what’s invite-only now? Clubhouse. That’s the app that Elon Musk used to roast Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. It’s a platform for audio-only chatrooms. It can’t effectively be described with text—you have to try it. Did you ever marry someone because of her tinder bio description? (the answer is no. hopefully. some things just can't be explained via text.)  I saw some articles about Clubhouse a couple days ago, and I thought “yeah yeah whatever. New social media thing. I was a Facebook guy, never got the hype about Snapchat, now lots of people are moving away from Snapchat, I bet this Clubhouse thing will pass too.”  Holy fuck I was wrong. There’s really nothing I can write about Clubhouse to make you think it’s good. You just have to try it.   Anyone else who has used the app, please comment below with your honest review.    The nice thing about the app is that it just fucking works—no lag, no choppy audio, no bullshit. It’s just effortless. Zoom, Discord, Skype, and all their competitors suck a big fat donkey dick compared to Clubhouse.   I literally use Clubhouse 16+ hours per day. My girlfriend fucking hates it.  But Clubhouse is ackshuallllly just a User Interface. The true magic sauce in this tasty tendie basket is the audio-processing platform. Agora (API) makes this software, and they charge Clubhouse a certain rate per 1000 minutes of use.  Think about that for a minute. The more you use Clubhouse (yes, you! the person reading this!) the higher Agora’s revenue goes, and the higher Agora’s stock price will go for its stockholders (again! this could be you! You could be a stockholder!).  This is like buying Xboxes at GameStop, except you don’t have to buy anything, you just have to use a fun app (which you are going to get addicted to anyway).  API has Clubhouse by the balls. Nobody, I repeat, NOBODY would use Clubhouse if it was laggy, choppy, or full of microphone issues. API is the rainmaker, the money printer, and the rocket fueller. There’s a gold rush right now and API patented the fucking pickaxe. Maybe a competitor can match them. Maybe Bing will be better than Google some day. Who knows.  Using the platform for the first time feels like you’ve been living in a 56k dialup world, downloading “Mr. Wilson from Castaway” themed porn (frame by frame), when suddenly the clouds part and the two co-founders of Agora (both named Tony) hand you a StarLink-powered 8k Jumbotron pre-loaded with Mia Khalifa’s greatest hits and the new Spongebob movie: Sponge on the Run.  It’s good shit.   It’s addictive. Do a web search (yes, do a web search with “google,” that search engine that you should have invested in back in 2006) for a graph of the user growth. Clubhouse’s membership is literally exploding faster than WSB’s members did during peak GameStop mania. You are going to be reading a LOT of articles about Clubhouse in the next few months. You don’t wanna be fucking late.  That said, you’re not early to the party. The stock gained $50 last week, closing around $100. All call strikes were ITM. They’re making new strikes up to $135. There’s a serious chance that these strikes could expire ITM as well, yielding a gamma squeeze. It's up about 8% right now. no big deal.  This party could go on a long time. The market cap is only $10 bn right now. Back when Google was a 10bn company, if you had invested $10k, you would have $1,420,  now.  Yes, I just compared API to Google. Why? Because tech matters. Google was just a search engine back in the early 2000’s. It grew because it was the best search engine. Agora makes audio processing platforms. It is BY FAR the best. Work from home is here to stay. Audio is fucking important.  Clubhouse might stick around, or it might be the next MySpace, idk. But whatever audio-chatroom app takes their place will have to pay Agora to use the audio processing software. Cha-ching. (Oh, and Agora’s voice and video platforms work in a million other industries too, like telemedicine, which might be useful since there’s a pandemic).  Cathie Woods threw a fuckton of money at Agora shares to get them in her ARKW etf. Additionally, unusual options trackers noticed that some big fat whale bought a fuckton of calls with the highest strike, $135. Some very smart people like the stock.  Do your own research, don’t gamble more than you’re willing to lose, and try out the Clubhouse app for yourself. It’s invite-only right now but you can join the waiting list and it might let you join in a couple days. It’s iPhone only right now.  Again—if you’ve used Clubhouse, please post a review below. And if you have questions or concerns about Agora (API) post them below as well—I get all my info from the internet and I want to know if I missed something.
NOK plans to buy back 550 million shares!!   the 21 million 'new' shares are for obligations! You see: Don't follow the FUD and do your own DD

Buying $800 3/19 calls?
So I’m sure many of you have seen that financial institutions have bought a shit load of  $800 3/19 calls. Would it be dumb to follow suit and buy some as well?
We like the stock
If not for the short, if not for the money, if not for the point, we like the stock. We trade these because we believe. We are not a ponzi scheme. We are not a hedge fund. WE ARE INVESTORS. WITH DIAMOIND HANDS AND BROAD BACKS. Apes with simple minds who can get behind the idea of watching a movie and playing some games. That is all
I gotta admit... I'm kinda retarded.
Case for $TGTX
Retards and autist. I smoked a fat jay with my roommates 20 minutes ago and now i'm stoned in my room. Been a good day, up 28% on calls for tgtx. This shit is bouta hit the outer atmospheric crust of uranus.   #CASE:   TGTX just got approved for Umralisib. If you're an autist like me that sounds like something you hear watching tv with your grandmother eating chicken tendies at 9 year old. You're right. Marginal zone B-cell Lymphoma is a cancer which cannot be treated[](  medicine is the first orally taken medicine which inhibits the growth of the cancer, at least in current studies. This shit passed, it's now in the BLA filing, which is an application to who takes up the standard on distributing this medicine in communities, to hospital, nursing homes, care centers, any shit you can think of even homeboy on the street corner is counting his bands with this news. You should too.  Sources:        Get in while you can  edit; not a financial advisor, get calls far otm 1-2 months out after their earnings.
IBKR won't let me buy options?
Let me start this off with saying I'm from Canada. I can't get Robinhood/think or swim/webull etc. So basically IBKR says anyone under 21 can't buy options. I'm 19, does anyone know if there's a way around this?
Yo...
Damn. You guys are warriors.  I sold everything in my IRA which is only $340.  Can I get in on this madness come Monday or am I way too late to the party. I want to be part of the battle.  Please advise.
How do stock calls really work? Noob here
A little confused, googled a lot... Need help.  Soooo stock calls. Say I bought a stock call at $3 (3 x 100 = $300).  Question 1: Is my maximum ability to lose than $300? Or can I now lose more then that?  Continuing... Say a month goes by, it’s now worth $6 (6 x 100 = $600) so now I sell the option call and I doubled my money... right? I’m done?  Ok let’s go scenario 2... Stock drops.. $2 (2 x 100 = $200) I sell the option, do my losses equal $300-200 = $100 in losses?  Is that basically it? Or am I totally lost? Also I can sell my option at any time before expiration? Also what happens when I hit expiration?  Sorry super noob questions... Teach me your ways!
I love this Gamestonk
Sh t got a lil real this week
You people need to understand that you are not waging a war on hedge funds.
This isn’t some ideological battleground. This is the stock market. There are hedge funds taking long positions, there are hedge funds going short  and hedging their bets with long positions .  You’re not “sticking it to the man” holding GME.   Trade based on what makes you money. Not ideology. Who gives a fuck. We don’t celebrate losses here to prove a point, we celebrate the stupid risky plays that the person took regardless of the fact it blew up in their face.   If you think you’re going to profit off holding, hold. Stop letting people hype you up and manipulate you by framing this as some act of defiance against a corrupt system. You’re being played.
Warning: Watch out for short-ladder attacks during the super bowl
Robinhood and the other hedge funds will take advantage of everyone being distracted by the game and will come with their best short ladder atacks. The like of which we haven't seen yet. Keep an eye open.
Just found a GME power up newsletter in my email and holy fuck I’m impressed with their trade ins
Observations and Analysis on S3 Short Interest Data Over the Past Week. SHORTS HAVEN'T COVERED. [DD]
As we all know S3 (aka S3llouts) are a bunch of slimy mother fuckers trying to spread misinformation about short interest numbers on our beloved stock. They attempted to change their formula and the way they represent short interest data after likely receiving a hefty lump sum from Melvin and Company.    compiled a list of their data they so 'kindly' gave to us and took a little deeper dive into what's going on so here it is:     S3 is literally pulling numbers out of their ass at this point and they can't be trusted. It's mathematically impossible for the shorts to have covered their positions.  If there's enough interest, I'll make a copy of this data and post it here so that you guys can fuck around with the numbers to see what you can make of it.  #TL;DR  S3 are CNBC shills who post fake data. Shorts haven't covered yet, mathematically impossible. Diamond hands, the squeeze can still be squoze.         -   Hey SEC, CNBC, S3 and other shills, this is NOT financial advice. In fact, this is completely satire and you should not listen to anything I have to say. I just like the stock.
Are share certificates still a thing? $GME TO MY WALL
I want a printed GME share to frame and mount on my wall to prove I was here. I held. Forever.
The analysts have it wrong with $BYND🍔
•Growth in plant-based foods is an obvious trend for many years to come. Not only for vegetarians but anyone looking for healthier options to add to their everyday life. Impossible Foods is their main competition here, but I believe there’s more than enough room in this growing industry for both companies and I’d buy into both if I could.   •Powerful partnerships: Pepsi, Yum Brands, Del Taco, and likely McDonalds soon. Beyond is also in countless smaller restaurants around the country and soon the world.   •More than just burgers. Remember when there was just 1 or 2 plant based milk options at the grocery store? Now there’s rows and rows of almond and oat milk variants. Same will happen with meat substitutes but in an even bigger way.  •Shorts to bust. Analysts have taken the wrong side on Beyond by failing to see the bigger picture. This will cost them.  •It’s a ‘virtue stock’. Retail investors increasingly like to buy stocks that are in line with their values. Beyond is a double whammy with both ecological and animal rights benefits.  •Covid has stalled Beyond’s progress, mainly because restaurant sales are down, but I believe this has provided a great buying opportunity before this stock goes to the moon and doesn’t come back   This is not financial advice I just like the stock.  1/21/22 170c
Admit it
If you actually care about DFV you would hope he sold and made his money. Not to say it won’t go back up, but his calls would be shitting the bed if he still has them. I’ve been seeing people on other boards at least admitting how much they’ve lost lol do you guys think it’ll hit 400+ again? Genuine question
Are you guys not worried about censorship and control of this subreddit?
since this subreddit became mainstream, it had major mods ban and other things. doesn't this show that this subredit is now corporate shillspace and controlled. i mean users are getting banned, posts being removed. how can now anyone be sure its a place with organic views. not saying centralization is bad. but reddit is really the big boss here and what govt says or does reddit will comply.
Retards, I have a serious question....
Day by day I watch as we dump more money into GME and in the morning we climb that ladder, and as the day progresses that ladder falls over due to these so called ladder attacks that end at the end of the day. Now I am by no means a stock market expert or a financial advisor, but my serious question is, what if someone were to build the ladder at the end of the day?Not a financial expert, just a monkey trying to learn how to use a ladder.
Help a fellow Ape
I wish to return to monke. What should I use to buy some of this GME?
Am I doing this right??
I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL
I don’t understand what everyone is freaking out about.
Hold your fucking shares if you want to hold or fucking sell if you are scared. Tell me to sell all you want but I’m going to buy more. We all find out the truth when the report comes out. Everyone wants you to do good until you are doing better than them. Those who sold are going to get salty if this report shows it was all a bluff. I’m going to get told “I told you so” if it comes out they did get out. At the end of the day it’s your own decision. I’m just glad I made the right one. But just know... when this report comes back saying these suits thought we were soft... it’s already too late.
If you sell, your wife's boyfriend will leave her. If you cared about her you wouldn't do that.
They're even paying for Silver Ads on Reddit now.
STILL HOLDING    YOU ONLY LOSE IF YOU SELL
Stonks

AMC YOLO UPDATE as of 02/05/2021 fun fact these are down less percentage than shares today.
Lmao look at this shit
This god damn Melvin. Knocking the house down next door for tennis courts. Look at all that shorted money. Click the link and take the tour of this cunts mansion
Squeeze is over apes. Short ratio is under 50%. I’ll hold with you retards. No hope 💩 💩 💩
Question about the Pressure on DFV
Hey all, first time posting here, but I was just thinking about holding and the impact that each of us has. Obviously, some more than others just due to when they started and how much they have. While we don't know if/when we will ever take off, if it is within the litigation period does that screw DFV completely?   As in could they freeze his account or some other stupid means of controlling him? I don't know that is bad, per se, as it forces him to   . Or on the other end of the spectrum could they force him to sell his shares?   I doubt the ladder is possible and the former is more in the ways of the law. But I was just curious. Any thoughts?  Positions: GME 1@250, 2@340, 2@200, 8@150 AMC 11 @
Please Explain The Hold
I’ve been in the shadows of this since the beginning, but also have some GME. What is the point of holding GME. I know so many of you are about to erupt on me, but, be nice.
Dang... Guess it's time to HOLD BABY
What should be the limit sell price for AMC?
I am wondering what is the realistic limit sell price? I already have it set at $100 but what is the realistic price it could reach?
Lets not forget why we need to win this fight if at all possible, We take care of each other when it counts.
Fellow GME shareholders
When is the next meeting? And do they usually serve snacks at those? Trying to become more hands on with my investments and see in person how they are performing. Bought 1 share @450.
How to sue the hedge funds (Repost #1)
Preface, I'm not a lawyer, don't message me gahdamnit.  First start by googling "Securities Lawyer". Find one in your area if you can, otherwise find one that's fairly close. Don't be shy, and don't self-reject. Some of them may tell you no, but you can be sure almost every lawyer in the country is dry humping their phone waiting for your phone call so that they can get their name on this guaranteed resume booster.  Once you find a securities lawyer, you will want to contact them. Use their form, and let them know a why you are contacting them.  1. You are wanting to sue for Market Manipulation, Potential Fraud, Potential Losses, Harmful Disinformation, Defamation, and Damages. (that should get you started in the right direction).    1. Let them know how many shares you have / had, and tell them your losses will be calculated based on the price of the shares when you believe the market manipulation happened ($518) 2. You will be hard pressed to find a lawyer that doesn't want in on this, so make sure you calculate the following two ways of paying for their services with that in mind.    1. Pay their lawyer fees. This is the way. If you can afford doing it this way, you will avoid paying them a percentage. Plus, in your law suit you can sue for lawyer fees and these hedge hogs will have to pay all of that for you.    2. Contingency Fee. This is the one you go for if you can not afford the upfront cost of lawyer fees. This one means the lawyers get nothing from you, but take a percentage of your winnings (if you win). Typical fee is 30%-40%, but due to the nature and national attention of this lawsuit, I'd say you try to negotiate them down to like 10%. This one isn't all bad though, it really gives them incentive to win for you. 3. Do your research. There is another Law Suit by   and you can google "Gary Carlin Law" and find a ton of articles about it. Use this to your advantage, and make sure in your lawsuit you sue every mother fucker that guy is suing. Also, feel free to hop on any class action lawsuit you see. They don't pay well, but ape together strong. Hop on Gary's class action.  That's all you need to know to get started. I fully expect the mods to remove this, or the bot to remove this, or the SEC / FBI to show up at my door. But I don't give a fuck, I'm squeaky clean and I'll just add all those names to my lawsuits. I'm not a lawyer, but I have sued the living dogshit out of malpractice a few times.  POS: Have a bunch of shares, you probably know which tickers.  Edit: The downvote bot army descended, so this is a repost.
Maybe someone could explain to me, could a short not buy a stock that's being shorted by another person (or even themselves) to settle their positions where they were shorting a $2 stock to be holding a $400 short?
What does holding do for us if we're using day trading apps  and the like, could they not still loan out our shares to shorts at the peak, sell them to other shorts (driving the price down in the process) so whilst the short percentage doesn't change it just moved to a higher break even point and refreshes the time they have and reduces interest payments? I'm a total mongrel with just one share on revolute but it just occurred to me that bar that number in the app I have nothing telling me I actually legally own that share and that they can't loan it without my permission
NYSE Short Interest Report
As many of us are waiting on the FINRA short interest report on 2/9, does anybody know where we’ll be able to access it? The only source I saw was behind a pay wall through the NYSE and The Ice. I haven’t been able to find anything outside of consolidated data for the entire exchange.  Would’ve been nice to see the previous report to see what we’d be looking for come Tuesday.  TL;DR: 🧐📚
An absolute must read on GME  🤲
The trick would be: “Make it look like we’ve covered our shorts when we really haven’t (because we can’t), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.”
I love owning a piece of a company and I want to give back. Who else would be interested in getting a gift card donation organized for those in need? Shareholders should set an example for what corporate goodwill is.
With some people stuck at home with the pandemic, I'm sure a lot of people are playing more video games. For those that can go out, I bet seeing a movie would really lift some spirits. Many students are struggling to pay for laptops and remote equipment.   I'm sure we all have or know someone who has been struggling.   For people who own stock, remember that you're a micro owner. Party of being an owner of a company is setting a good example.   I would like to see if people would be interested in doing a gift card donation to those in need or those who just need a smile.   A smile and random act of kindness can change the world.  We can do it on the assistance subreddit.  I figure we could get it up and running within a day.
Thanks for the add guys!
Hey, I've got 64 dollars and a phone with wealthsimple loaded. Anything you like?
Why do people think WSB can't move a stock like GME?
I have seen people saying shit like " WSB didn't move GME it was really the whales!! "  Lets do some basic math  We have   million members, let's not talk about all the lurkers. On average we can assume everyone has about $  the low end imo)   That's   billion in potential purchasing power.   What's GME market cap?   billion Am I missing something?  For all the OG WSB people, what's the whole reason we got into GME? Has anything changed???
DKTS
What is happening with OTC, DKTS over the last few weeks?   I normally do not play any OTCs however I try to follow some of the activity that goes on around them. A while back I found this sub-penny ticker. And have noticed volume starting to come into it and recently the price is starting to move. Just trying to understand what's happening with this ticker and what kind of play or strategy people are trying to accomplish here?
The SEC website is basically a government regulated forum of companies saying “I like the stock”
Think about it.     The SEC Website = WallStreetBets (But with government regulation)   Their forum is set to “Approved posts only mode”   Retards (The Companies) submit content basically saying “I like this stock, I bought xxxx shares”   MODS approve the post   Other people read their posts, the market reacts accordingly   Where as here, retards say “I like the stock”, their words are posted immediately and the market reacts almost instantaneously. All without big brother up our ass (for now).  If the SEC is here reading this - You’re just jealous that we have cool flairs and shit and you don’t , so suck it  SEC forum is basically legal market manipulation, don’t try to convince me otherwise because im retarded as fuck
Everyone banking on Tuesday’s SEC report.
I know everyone here is still grasping at straws here for anything to validate their decisions to hold. But be honest with yourself.   What makes you think this report tomorrow will change anything, they’ve cheated the system this whole time. Even if $GME is still super shorted you think they will just play nice this time?  Hedge funds clearly don’t play by the same rules as us and will find a way to fuck us no matter what we do. They will take a fine and lie about shorts or our apps won’t let us buy shares anymore, they will spread fake news again.   Why is this different than before? I know all you retards are fighting the good fight but I just have 0 faith in this “Free Market”.   Good luck bois.  Edit; I know this is gonna get downvoted to hell, but I’ve been on this sub a long time. I know how the diamond hands game ends. You can’t beat the market.  I’m not telling anyone to sell or buy, just throwing out my thoughts. A lot of butthurt folks here.
Call me paper hands but let's be honest, we are retarded.
We didn't sell at a peak. We are dumb as fuck and eat crayons.   Don't fuck your entire investment, or do.... But we lost this one. We didn't sell at 400$+ or 15$+ on gme and amc.  Me personally, I'm gonna keep what little money I have left after being dumb hoping for tendies but my dream is done.  (I'm on my 18+ account so ban me if you will)  This isn't financial advice.  Just my story of losing.
Short information coming out on the 9th for GME
I just wanted to bring attention to those who do not know, the short interest information is coming out on the 9th in regards to GME hedge short positions.  Now there have been a lot of posts talking about why the short interest is still going to be substantial.  I believe on Jan 15th the percentage was something above 80% shorted shares of the outstanding shares.  Since then, the media and hedges have been doing everything they can to drive the price down.  It is blatantly obvious...  For the last few days, GME has seemed to hit a wall at around that $50-60 range.  Which means they are struggling to drive it down further even with the manipulation.  I think the second part of the squeeze is imminent.  This is not financial advise.  If you don't have money you are willing to lose, don't invest.  Your finance decisions are entirely your own responsibility.  Let me know what you think is going to happen on Tues.
Robinhood's piece-of-shittery extends to them preventing me from withdrawing my money as I attempt to leave.
Like many who were appalled by Robinhood's behavior in limiting GME buying at the most critical time, I made the easy decision that I'd abandon the platform in favor of a real brokerage (Fidelity for me). This morning I attempted withdrawing my funds from my Robinhood account only to experience two different errors, shown  .   One error is about some mysterious additional verification that I need to complete, but with zero ability to initiate that, other than going to their support team. It also suggests the issue is due to the account I was attempting to withdraw to.  So, I tried withdrawing to the other one of my two linked bank accounts, only to receive an "unexpected server error." The error message suggests trying again later. Well, I've tried about 10 different times today and get the same message every time.  It appears to me that RH is making it as difficult as possible for me to move my own money off their shady platform. Is anyone else experiencing this?

PSA: Fidelity accounts (prevent GME/AMC shares from being shorted!!)
Fam,  Just spent 30 minutes on the line with Fidelity. Bottom line: if you have a   MARGIN   account with level 3 or 4 options approval,   THEY ARE LENDING OUT YOUR SHARES  .  However, you can request that they   DO NOT   lend  specific shares , or even  all of your shares . You just have to call them. It will go through a 3-5 day adjudication process, and they will either approve it 1) with no changes to your options approvals, or 2) approve it and lower your option level.  Retirement accounts: mine are at level 2 options approval, and the rep told me my shares are   NOT   being lent out to shorts due to these being IRAs and the level 2 options approval I currently have.  Non-qual accounts: if you have level 3/4, they may downgrade your account to level 2 if you request your shares to be "un-shortable." This ultimately comes down to the adjudication process.  I hope this is helpful to someone holding shares, and I hope it hurts those cocksucker hedge funds.  Not financial advice / I like the stock / GME & AMC to the 🌖       Edit: Fidelity customer service 800-343-3548. Don't tell them I sent you ;)  Edit 2: tighten the fucking noose on the shorts. If you're on other brokerages - call them and post the how-to for others. Major military battles have been won by attacking the enemy's supply lines. You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.  Edit 3: I'll hold your hand all the way.... click the tab Accounts & Trade > Account Features > Brokerage & Trading > Options. That will show you your options levels. Tighten the grip!    Edit 4: hard to quantify, but if   ALL OF YOU   call your brokerage and cut off the lending of shares it will have a major positive affect on the GME share price.... let's call it a "synthetic" buy order to further help the short squeeze. Hedge funds know the rules, it's time we stop being dumb retail traders and learn how our "CoMmIsSiOn FrEe BrOkErAgE" makes money off of us

TDC 5x immediate upside
Hey Lads, I've been lurking on here since 2016, and today I bring you TDC.  I think Teradata (TDC) has 5x immediate upside. I could post some more in-depth DD, but I 'm trying to get this idea posted before market open so anyone who wants to can get in before the massive ripper. I think the following cuts to the chase  I was lucky enough to pitch this shitco to an investment club in college back in 2014. At the time, TDC was being disrupted by Hadoop/the cloud and all signs pointed to the slow death of this legacy data warehousing business. My idea was basically laughed off the floor and the club didn't buy, and honestly I couldn't blame them in hindsight. I followed this business for the next 7 years and saw it ripped 30% last week, and is now up 11% in premarket.  Apparently, TDC has managed to launch a cloud-based data warehousing alternative to Snowflake. This business segment just achieved $100 million in annual recurring cloud-based revenues, with yoy growth of 100%+. This compares to Snowflakes \~$400 million, which is also growing at triple digits. I would say that TDC is a pretty serious competitive threat to SNOW at this size.  SNOW is valued at 175x sales (\~90 billion market cap), and TDC is valued at   sales ($3 billion market cap). If you were to slap a 170x revenue multiple on TDC's emerging cloud business, it would be worth $17 billion, up from $3 billion this morning.  TDC has about 20% short interest just received a buy rating from BofA. The squeeze has already started and the stock is up  37% on the week, but I believe we are in the early innings of a 500% ripper. Major sellside analysts are starting to upgrade the stock.  Unlike GME, which is a dinosaur facing two asteroids (death of the mall, death of physical game discs) TDC is a recovering shitco with an extremely attractive cloud business that is going to compete directly with SNOW. There are some very attractive quality underpinnings to this trade -   this isn't a pump and dump, it's a classic turnaround that could rip past $100 this month.  I'm buying weeklies on open, see you fellas on the moon            edit\  will post more DD later  Recent   for anyone interested. TLDR; cloud annual recurring revenues were up 100% in 2020, guidance suggests 165% growth in Q1 2021 and 100% growth for FY 2021. Strong results, and sell-side is catching on. This isn't just some short squeeze.
DD: Why Gamestop GME is worth $1000 without a squeeze
A little background first.  Gamestop was heavily shorted last year as hedge funds though it was a dying company.    However in September Ryan Cohen who is the largest individual hold of Apple stock and founder of hugely profitable digital per food company Chewy started buy huge chunks of GME stock and indicating he was going to turn the company from brick and mortar retailer to a profitable online gaming juggernaut.  Also Michael Burry of The Big Short fame sent a letter to the GME board     Once WSB got hold of this we saw the huge inflows of retail traders which pushed the price to $480 before buying was restricted culling the potential short squeeze.  Now Gamestop's price to sales ratio (P/S Ration) is currently less than 1.   (Market Cap $  /Annual revenue ~$7BN).  This seems fine for a dying brick and mortar but if the company becomes profitable (likely in next earning report in March) and starts to transform into a tech digital platform for gaming (likely as e AWS exec hired as CTO) it's P/S ratio will start rising to match other tech companies.  Square (SQ) for example has a P/S ratio of 14+    If GME had a similar P/S ratio (after the above happens) the share price would be well above $1000 per share.  Also remember the market is forward looking so if it seems signs of profitability and transformation then it will head to that valuation well before the process is complete.    I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice, this is my personal opinion only.  Edit: Thanks for all the awards folks.  Ignore the bots and shills with "this is retarded" comments with no counter arguments. Why would they make comments like this, they must be scared.  Edit 2: This is an update for those who have a hard time understanding my post.  I'll dumb it down a bit for you guys with eh limited IQ's.  Tech companies are valued at higher multiples than brick and mortar stores.  The new Gamestop board is looking to transform it into a tech business.  See Tesla vs legacy auto and the difference in multiples there.
Reminder of what ACTUALLY happened with GME.
All you people saying things like 'the squeeze happened, you missed it', 'don't gamble on stocks', 'the bagholders were the greedy ones', 'people with no experience trading shouldn't have bought gme', 'GME was a stupid play from the beginning', 'I was wrong to buy GME', 'I should have sold GME'. Are all talking complete fucking bullshit and are twisting the truth and recollection of what actually happened, in reality, for actual fact. I don't know if they are bots, people who missed out or bitter bag holders but they are just fucking dead wrong about what the GME play was attempting and came within a few hours of accomplishing.   GME went from $40 to a peak of $483 within a WEEK. The biggest shorter got bailed out for $  because of how bad their position was. WSB was getting national fucking coverage. This sub went from 2 million to 8 million subscribers. There were 60 million shares shorted going into thursday and at its all time high, would have cost a staggering 29BN dollars to buy back less whatever they were shorted at and that is not even counting the price going up by doing so.   So no the squeeze didn't fucking happen, no you weren't wrong for buying in at 200 or 300 or even 400. The play worked and it got within hours of paying out.   I know this because the brokers got margin called by the clearing houses for fuck sake. Now RH and other brokers might say it was liquidity issues but I can tell you for a fact that all those shorters got their shares from somewhere and if you think a few million people buying shares with CASH deposits in any way compares to the ALMOST CERTAIN losses that the brokers were facing due to likely defaults by shorters was the reason they turned off buying, you are dead fucking wrong.   The brokers got margin called any way you look at it and they should have margin called the shorters. But they didn't. They pussied out and did something criminal. They affected one side of a trade and not the other, that is an unprecedented manipulation if ever I have seen one. But I ain't suprised by it and neither should anyone else and that is not the point of this post anyway.  Stop saying it didn't work, it was never going to work, we got greedy, we got stupid and all the other hind sight self delusions to make yourself feel better. The play worked because it went by the rules these people had set and you can't blame yourself or anyone else or redicule people for getting involved, when those rules get changed at the last second. The GME play was solid and made history, never forget that you fucking pussies.  Edit: I sold at   the other week and put it all back in on friday just gone, make of that whatever you want  Edit2:     yeah i took some profit, i never said i was the hero of this story..  Edit3: Can't keep up with comments. Either you believe brokers restricted buying because of increased collateral requirements due to USERS buying in CASH. Or you believe that maybe, the tens of billions of increased buyback costs on shares they had lent out where somehow setting off the clearing houses tolerance alarms.. your choice.  And I have not and will not advise anyone to do anything regarding the future of GME, make your own fuckin mind up. thank you for all the pretty icons

How 75% of GME Shares Are Still Shorted. S3 is Wrong.
\ First off, this is my opinion based on the facts available. This is by no means financial advice. I am not a financial advisor\   If you are not familiar with EDGAR, it is the SEC’s database for various types of company filings. One of those filings is called the 13G.   \ “The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Schedule 13G form is an alternative filing for the Schedule 13D form and is used to report a party's ownership of stock which exceeds 5% of a company's total stock issue. Schedule 13G is a shorter version of Schedule 13D with fewer reporting requirements.”\   When a company decides to dispose of beneficial ownership of stock, and holds more then 5% of shares available, they are required to AMEND the filing 13G, making it the 13G/A. When these documents are submitted, they are filed under both the beneficial owner and issuer of stock in EDGAR.   In the case of GameStop’s “short squeeze”, and understanding the exchange of shares during that time period, BlackRock Inc. (BLK) was the only institutional holder, owning over 5% of shares, that liquidated their position SO FAR. BlackRock Inc. liquidated 9,217,335 shares of GameStop on 1/26/2021.     \ -f: GameStop  BlackRock is the SECOND largest institutional holder of GME, behind FMR LLC with 9,534,090 shares, according to Yahoo Finance. So… you are probably wondering, “How many shares of GME do The Top 10 Institutions hold combined ?”     Let’s Count:  \ FMR LLC\    9,534,090  \ BlackRock Inc\     - 9,217,335 (According to 13G/A)  \ Vanguard Group Inc.\  5,288,507  \ Susquehanna International Group LLP\  4,444,128  \ Dimensional Fund Advisors LP\   3,948,114  \ Senvest Management LLC\   3,225,740  \ State Street Corporation\  2,609,487  \ Morgan Stanley\  1,995,842  \ Paradice Investment Management LLC\  1,832,526  \ Norges Bank Investment Management\  1,811,792  Total: 25,472,891 Shares of GME or   =   54% of Float Shares       On the same Yahoo Finance page where we found ‘Top Institutional Holder’ data, if you scroll down, you can see ‘Top Mutual Fund Holders’. Combined, these funds hold   =   40%   of float shares.  \ Note that two of these mutual funds own over 5% of shares, meaning they would need to file with the SEC if they were to sell. These two mutual funds hold   22%   of float shares. \   Accounting for BlackRock’s liquidation,   54  % of shares are held by the Top 10 Institutional Holders at the moment. Lets say, worst case scenario, only the two biggest mutual funds are left holding shares, making that   22%   of float shares. So far, we have accounted for   76%   of all shares.   The last data we have on short interest is \~  122%   of float shares. The media has reported numbers as low as   33%   short interest post squeeze  ,   according to S3 partners. Mathematically, this is impossible.   If short interest is truly   33%,   that means these institutional holders would have filed a 13G/A…. But they didn’t…..meaning they did not sell. This means that there is still,   at a minimum, 76% of float shares shorted.    This is VERY high and could cause another squeeze.    TL:DR    As you know, lots of bagholders around the world are not selling. It just so happens that we are not alone. We have some of the BIGGEST institutions bagholding with us;   minimum     76% of float shares in fact  . If you thought that we were the only greedy and vengeful mfs out there, you are sorrily mistaken. These institutions (  Fidelity, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley) want to see this second squeeze just as much as you. Until then, HOLD THE LINE!!!  Edit: I made a mistake. The 13G/A that BlackRock Inc filed on 1/26/2021 was a statement of ownership form, declaring that their position of GME was 9,217,335 shares. There was no liquidation of shares.  Edit: An institutional owner that owns more then 5% of float shares needs to file a 13D/A within 10 days if their ownership changes by 1% or more. This is important when searching for updated data on what institutions exchanged shares.
Why I’m big on oil
Back again with the oil DD. Last time was right and got some juicy tendies.   Short answer: it do go up  Long answer: Many reasons. Oil futures market is in backwardation. I know it’s a long word, but it just means that there is a short/medium term mispricing in the commodity market. Signaling a possible shortage in supply.  Also, lockdowns are easing, I don’t have to explain to you what this means.  Also, majority of shares took a beating after earnings report. It does not take a genius to know that stonks only go up.   But which stock you say?   RDS. I like it for the long term for various reasons, but it is one of the few oil stocks that has good news in the short term: it has just increased the dividend and made some cute acquisitions. Also, it’s much leaner after the post covid impairments.   Disclaimer after you freshies flooded the sub: this is not investment advice.   Positions: 500 shares, 10 Dec2022 20C, 10June2021 18C  Rockets:
You're buying TTWO before earnings, right?
• ATVI & EA had great earnings so TTWO probably will thanks to NBA 2K and that new heist for GTA Online  • Best positioned for the PS5/Xbox Series X console cycle since they have a lower revenue base to grow off of and higher revenue mix of console games  • The assholes are charging $  for games on the new consoles, which means the $10 bump means margins & profits are going to be a bit higher  • Stock rockets when GTA 6 gets announced  • Most importantly: GameStop makes money by selling their games. You like GameStop, then you better fucking love TTWO
$SLV is Currently Undervalued Whether There is a Squeeze or Not (Physical market price discrepancies)
Last week there were a lot of people hating on the posts about silver going up. These people instead pumped stocks like $GME and $AMC (which went down 75%). There are real reasons why silver is going to go up.  First of all, physical silver is becoming more and more difficult to get by the day. Currently an ounce of physical silver will cost you anywhere from $34 - $40. This is $7 - $13 over paper silver prices. It makes you wonder why physical is going up so much when the paper market is still staying flat/going down.  There is manipulation in the silver market by big banks such as JPM and Goldman Sachs. COMEX can just create paper silver contracts out of thin air, which keeps the silver prices down. The COMEX cannot possibly fill all of the open interest on the silver futures contracts. That's why when silver started to go up last week, they raised the margin requirements on the contracts by 18%, forcing larger players to sell when they received margin calls.  With all the money printing going on, and rates being held near zero, its hard to believe that the price of silver is fairly valued. I believe that all this money will eventually find its way into silver, just like it found its way into the stock market.
Don’t Leave!
I’ve seen a lot of new subs pop up claiming to be “the new WSB” and yes we’ve seen this before for various reasons. But this time may be different. We are fragmented and frustrated. WSB has amassed an enormous following, whether they are bots, shills, normies, onlookers, boomers, retards etc.   It may not ever be the same as it was but it may become something better... a collective super autistic intelligence beyond what anyone could have imagined!   Let the normies learn the way of WSB and assimilate. Let the bots be purged and the haters lose interest after a month or so. I believe most new members are like me when I first joined, wanting out of the boring world of boomer stocks and responsible investing. I’ve been here for over a year and in that short time I’ve learned that stocks only go up and so should our member count. I’ve made more in a single day than I did working an entire year at any job thanks to this sub. I’ve also lost enough to be physically sick. We will get through this as we have before so stick around and keep up the good work!

Can someone explain to me a few things about AMC stock?
For what we know it is not as shorted as GME, correct? If I remember correctly it's only at 70-80% shorted vs GME closer to 120% 2 weeks ago. Is there any way the    could use the remaining to fill their shorts over time by trading between each other?  👍   GME 45 @ $170. All are in my will. Free PS5 or XBox whatever's for all of us.
Any space ape     podcasts involving $GME I can fall asleep to over the weekend?
Help me out.
Can we short DISNEY for firing Johnny Depp?
Last year, Johnny Depp lost his libel case in the UK High Court against The Sun newspaper, who referred to him as a "wife beater" - an accusation he strongly denies. His wife Amber Heard, who the star married six years ago, alleged 14 incidents of assault by her ex-husband in the case. While now Depp and his legal team are set to receive an oral hearing in March as they seek to appeal the court's decision.  After losing the case, Warner Bros asked Depp to resign his role of the villain Grindelwald in the Fantastic Beasts series of films, which he accepted.  The star had only shot one scene for the third movie, with Mads Mikkelsen replacing him in the Harry Potter prequels.  Meanwhile, supporters of Depp have been wondering if he'll be able to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 and beyond.  Well according to The Hollywood Reporter, producer Jerry Bruckheimer wanted the 57-year-old to at least cameo in the upcoming Margot Robbie-led spin-off, but allegedly Disney balked at the idea.  Nevertheless, Depp's fans have been right behind him in calls for the star to be reinstated as Captain Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.  And now a   titled "We want JOHNNY DEPP back as CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW" is fast approaching half a million signatures."     Let's go fam, time to short the s\ \ \ t out of Disney and any hedge fund supporting them, and have them re-instate the pirate legend.
Do I still hold $GME and $AMC????
I’m new to stocks and have just been buying shares based on everybody on social media. I have no clue about any of this. If anybody can refer me to some good ways to learn stocks that would be great
What if the big guys start betting more on GME going up than they did it going down and you guy us make them money?
The best thing about GME was WSB
;’) Yeah I’d pay $300 for you  😭  Ps noooo ffffff flair is too hard for a noob
Can we really trust the February 9th release of info on shorts?
I have a very bad feeling that hedges are waiting for this date to show some kind of mis-represented or misleading information on the shorts, and causing the stock to crash further before selling.  Everyone here is saying s3 changed their formula, as well as other sites. There's a general consent that [its very possible] hedge funds using dirty tactics to also make it look like they've covered when they couldn't possibly. As there simply wasn't enough volume and upward stock movement to cover.   If they can't manipulate or misrepresent the nasdaq results, then they should be very aware of the high possibility the stock will rebound on Feb 9-10. So unless they cover their positions on Monday (which is VERY last minute) they're going to be paying way way more to cover than it is now. On top of that, I'm expecting the volume / price on Monday to go up, as many people are similarly speculating  possibility of GME making a comeback with the Short news.  However, if they can manipulate or misrepresent the NASDAQ listings, it would make a lot more sense: as a lot of people are holding onto the stock for the Feb 9 results. If that happens, I imagine they would cover on the 11-12 after the price drops   What are your thoughts on the matter?    Edit: to clarify I'm very bullish on GME. I'm not trying to spread FUD. I'm trying to explain why it might be a good idea to hold past Feb 9th if the stock crashed. As well as why the short interest might look the way it is
EFTs and basic industry standards for morons
Hey scrubs, financial advisor here. I will not disclose the firm I work at, but regularly do business with just about all of the big ones, including Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, JPMorgan, and more. None of what follows is advice, but education for the unwashed masses who keep asking the same questions over and over that I'm tired of seeing, all over WSB and the other investing subreddits. Here are some basics on settlements, linking bank accounts, EFTs, wires, and transfers to/from institutions.    EFTs and linking bank accounts    1. When attempting to link a bank account to a new account at your broker of choice, the firm will attempt to establish contact with your bank and confirm that the account exists and that it belongs to you. If the bank has the infrastructure in place to verify this digitally, your link will be instant. As a result, big banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo should instantly link and allow you to transfer funds. 2. If the link is not instant, your bank was unable to verify immediately. This is common for credit unions, small banks, and is about 50/50 for the online banks. They simply do not have the infrastructure in place to instantly verify. A good broker will now require you to upload proof that the account is yours - generally a voided check or bank statement. This is a security measure to protect you idiots, and you should be grateful for it. IMPORTANT: If needing to submit documents as proof, this will normally take up to 3 business days to approve. However, as it is the busy season for brokers (see the bottom note on this post), it's likely that their back offices are overwhelmed and it may take longer. Pick a different bank if you have a problem with this. 3. EFTs typically process within 3 business days, or 72 hours. If this is a NEW relationship with a broker and you make a larger transfer, the very first transfer may take longer, generally up to 10 business days. Once again, this is a security measure to protect against fraud. Subsequent transfers will now adhere to the 3 business day rule in most cases, barring extenuating circumstances. 4. If you're desperate, you should be able to locate wire information for your broker. You can now wire funds directly to your brokerage account for instant settlement.    Wires for dummies    Bank wires generally settle instantly or very quickly (within minutes) IF YOU MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:  Process the fucking wire before 4pm EST, because that's when the central banks start to close. If you process close to 4pm or after, it will settle on a best efforts basis, which usually means the next morning. Don't be an idiot.  Also keep in mind that many firms charge a fee to send a wire, but some do not. I know of a few that do not charge to send or receive wires, but I'm not here to advise or tell you idiots where to go with your money.    Transfer of assets (TOA) via the ACATS system    1. ACATS is the system by which most brokerage firms can transfer shares back and forth without selling. Doing so requires you to have an account of the same registration at the receiving firm to the one at the contrafirm that will be sending the shares. Roth IRA to Roth IRA, taxable brokerage to taxable brokerage. 2. Most assets, particularly ETFs, individual equities, and bonds will transfer in-kind. Most mutual funds as well. Be sure to verify that you do not hold any institutional mutual funds before transferring, as they may be required to be sold. This isn't a big deal in a tax-deferred account, but can screw you over in a taxable one. Penny stocks are accepted on a firm-by-firm basis, so be sure to check your firms rules. Again, this is to protect your stupid asses. 3. Initiating a TOA is done on the receiving firms end and generally requires you to upload a statement from the contrafirm dated within the last six months which shows your account registration, number, your name, and the positions within the account. Settlement is generally 7-10 business days, but often process as quickly as 3-5, if you're transferring between large firms. 4. If your cost basis and metadata doesn't show right away, sit the fuck down and chill out. It will follow within a few business days most of the time, but can take up to a full month, depending on firm. E-Trade is notorious for being slow about their metadata.  5. A full account TOA will result in the receiving firm "sweeping" the old account for a month. Residual balances, cash, dividends, and more will sweep over. If you still have a balance after a month, simply initiate a new TOA. 6. Most firms will not require paperwork for an ACATS transfer, but if you must fill some out, it's because the contrafirm wants a signature for whatever reason. Stupid, but sometimes necessary to move on with your life. If you're charged a transfer fee by the contrafirm and are actually transferring real money and not the lunch money your mom gave you, call the new broker and request that it be reimbursed. If your new broker has local branches, start there - you'll have less of a wait time and will likely get to speak with a senior planner, but they're generally only open during normal business hours.    DTC transfers    DTC transfers are not as common as TOAs via the ACATS system, but are sometimes necessary. If needed, check with your receiving firm to acquire their DTC number, then call your current firm to request the DTC transfer. You'll need your new firm's information, your new account number, and the new firms DTC number handy.    Basic customer support availability    1. The busiest times for brokerage firms are at the end of the tax year and the beginning of the new year through tax time. The reason for this is that many clients who have actual money - which excludes most of you - have tax-related items to address and typically put it off until the last second. For end of year, this includes last-minute tax-loss harvesting, charitable giving strategies, required minimum distributions, retirement account contributions, and more. For the new year, it can be some of the same but, more often than not, is all of the planning, money movement, and close-of-business that clients put off during the holidays and now want to address in the new year.  2. This means that your hold times are likely to be long, so be nice to your goddamn reps and try calling before market open, before lunch, or early afternoon. Around the open, lunch time, and just after normal business hours are typically the worst times to try and get through. If you have an advisor in a 1:1 capacity, they may or may not be able to help you "skip the queue", but may or may not be available themselves. Also note that while many of these firms offer 24/7 support and service, many teams are only available during certain business hours. Generally advisors/planners, specialist teams, etc. Ex - you wanna talk to your firm's strategy desk after market close? Tough shit, they're probably gone.  These are some of the basics. Ask away if you have questions, but I'm drinking now and can't speak for the quality of responses.
Down almost 68k, but all i care is that today was green, i’m a retard through and through. HOLD
Retards holding multiple hundred shares of $GME
I don’t know how autistic you guys have to be to know this game is up because you guys attracted too much pussies in game and those pussies sold at stop loss.   So go ahead and sell call options for the shares you’re holding. If GME falls you still get something from selling the options. If it reaches the strike price you still get to sell at strike price. Literally win win situation.
Buy SLV
For sweet silvery tendies
Listen up you smooth brained imbeciles. This is where the money is.
GME is so yesterday. AMC is tanking. BB is the fucking wave. Partnering with Amazon. Google is eyeing them. Motley fool had them in top 3 stocks this week.. blackberry is incredibly undervalued and will continue to rise. Too the fookin moon mates     🤌🏻
And just like that, all the folks on reddit that thought they were smarter than Wall street “Nah bro im holding strong!” “I was planning on losing that money anyway sooo” “Im just trying to stick it to the HF’s so Im happy losing money” “ This is just money I had to burn”. You fucking idiots 🤘🏻 .
Public announcement
Ok so there’s a couple things I would like to say to those that have recently joined this sub thinking it’s the Alaskan gold rush. 1. When you win, please be great full. I know I’m no og but for those of us that have been here prior to the GME craze understand when to be happy about a win. If you make money you should be happy. No it’s ands or buts, you have a dollar that you didn’t have before be grateful for god sake. 2. To the losers (not in a negative tone). If you thought the market was going to be easy and just print money for you I am truly sorry to burst your bubble. If things where that easy then everyone would be rich. You may think that you are special so you can win in this game. Well hate to break it to you, you may be special but not special enough to win in this game. 3. UNDERSTANDING: be aware that the market has ups and downs. Panic is not the answer. Some days your up some days your down. If you want to succeed in the game you need to be persistent but not naive. Understand when a loss is a loss but don’t get to trigger happy. 4. Everyone has won and everyone has lost don’t think your special because you just so happened to be on either side.  5. LASTY: if you have taken a large loss, remain calm. Everything will be ok! I’m not telling you to double down but I’m not saying to quit. You need to evaluate your financial position and make an educated decision on whether or not to continue. If you have lost greatly, sometimes it’s best to take a break and revaluate at a later time. DONT WORRY YOU WILL BE OK!  Synopsis: it’s a dangerous game. Have fun, be safe and make smart decisions that will benefit you in the long run. Know when to take profits or when to call it quits. Good luck to all!
YOLO - Holding till the moon or I die. Ignore the massive shill army - they're here because we have Wall Street by the balls. WE HOLD & THEY BLEED.
There is now a GME-dedicated sub. Please go there to post about GME!
If you want to post about GME, please go do it on this sub! I used to love the variety of different stocks WSB was doing DD on and investing in but now everything is Gamestop. This is turning people off from the sub, and pushing people to start other subs because only GME posts gain traction. Many people have spent a lot of time and effort to post DD on other investments only to have gotten down voted and/or banned.  This will probably get downvoted to the ground, but it needed to be said. Take it from a pre-GME wallstreetbetter, this sub was a lot more fun when it wasn't dedicated to one stock.
Most recent $GME Short Interest data according to S3 Partners puts shorts at an average short of just $53 a share as of 2/5
Please bear with me, as this is my first post here after reading a thousand posts over the past month or so.  HODLing 120 shares of $GME, I am not a financial professional, definitely don't buy on my advice alone, do your own DD.    As we all know, finding accurate short interest data is hard to come by.  By the time the official numbers are released (coming this Tuesday 2/9!) it is too late, as they are for almost 2 weeks prior.  As such, we have to rely on estimates of the data.  One of the companies providing those estimates is S3 Partners.  Many of us here have very mixed opinions about them, and my own is still being decided.    Regardless, if the information they are providing is any way accurate, it gives us a sense of what price the shorts are in at, which is a huge factor at play.  If they had covered earlier, and then shorted the stock at 350 a share?  Bad news for us.  However, it appears this is not the case!  Read on, those of you that can.  Have a banana for those of you who cannot.  2 days ago, the twitter face of S3's data, Ihor Dusaniwsky tweeted this:     "   short interest is $ ;   shs shorted;   SI % Float;   S3 SI % Float; 11% borrow fee and rising. Shs shorted have decreased by   over the last week. Shorts are down -$  in 2021, which includes up +$437M on today's -18% move."  Now I'm no expert, but a dollar amount on the short interest, coupled with the number of shares, should give us an estimate of the average dollar amount that shares are being shorted at, right?  If I short 100 shares at $10 apiece, my short interest is $1000, no?  Well, take that $  and   shares shorted the other day, and you get $   Which makes sense, because he goes on to say that they are up $437M on Thursday, as the stock was down 18% at the time and the numbers work out.    Likewise, he tweets again the day tomorrow, 2/5, with similar data, BUT one big difference.  The number of shares shorted is barely changed, however the short interest is only $  now.  Read:     "   short interest is $ ;   shs shorted;   SI % Float;   S3 SI % Float;   borrow fee. Shs shorted have decreased by   over the last week. Shorts are down -$  in 2021, which includes down -$368M on today's +27% move to $68."  And much like the day before, the numbers add up!  They lost $368M because the stock rose from $54 to what he was seeing at the time, $68ish, and   shares shorted times $14 apiece is a loss of $368M.  Furthermore, it lines up with the price they are now shorted at, which was $  a share ($  shares).       Okay, if you're still with me, and I'm totally off base here, let me know.  I'm actually not a true believer in a short squeeze still happening. However I am a true believer in not allowing hedge funds to short a company to oblivion.  They are neither fraudulent nor in financial difficulties, they have new leadership and a path forward, and while one could argue what the true price of their stock should be, you could say that about half of the speculative stocks that exist in the market today.    Anyway, thanks for reading, looking for additional data that you may provide in the comments below rather than the recent twitch chat spamfest of the past few weeks.

Ticker ABML is a no brainer if you can buy Recycling batteries
Ticker ABML is a no brainer if you can buy Recycling batteries  Nancy pelosi’s som is a big investor.        To the fucking moon   American Battery Metals Corp (OTCQB: ABML) CEO Doug Cole joined Steve Darling from Proactive with news the company has been awarded a $  million grant by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office. The grant is part of the DOE’s effort to reduce the US’s dependence on critical materials by aiding American companies.  Cole says what's more, the commercial pilot pilot will produce 20,000 tons of recycled battery metals, translating to $200M in revenues. Cole adds the group will work towards producing 200,000 tons. The company completed three key milestones regarding its pilot recycling plant located in Fernley, Nevada. The company announced that it purchased the land at 345, Winston Lane in Fernley where ABMC will build five buildings as part of the  .  Additionally, the company also managed to clinch the crucial water rights for the plant.  It is a major development for ABMC since the company will be able to operate its pilot plant at full tilt for many years without any scarcity of water.  Last but not the least; the company also revealed that it appointed the services Miles Construction to be the designer and contractor for the pilot plant.

My hemorrhoids are flaring up
Every time I wipe shitting on these people selling, my diamond hands split them open.   I proudly wave the bloody white flag of surrendering to the tendies.  Our time is coming. Hold the line. Hold for the memes. Hold for the cause. Whatever you hold for, remember what you're doing it for.  Bloody baboon asses unite, what are you holding for?
GME and future of WSB ?
Fellow retards,  I have a couple points I'd like to discuss. I owned GME and sold it most of them when Robinhood screwed us for good. I made TENDIES which is what mattered and why I have been in the sub. I'm not a paid hedge fund bot or shill but I AGREE that hedge funds would love the current state of this sub in my smooth opinion.  I've been following the sub around a year. I was a retard and brained washed by boomer financial advices which didn't make me a lot of TENDIES. I got hooked in during March/April when the stock market crashed and autists made fortunes with puts on SPY and calls on Tesla. I was amazed by beautiful retardness.  WSB did something truly amazing. GME was the trade of this quarter century. A dude in basement with DDs and bunch of retards did something crazy. Thousands of retards made thousands of dollars. It has changed lifes for good for many people.  However, the sub has been fallen victim to its success. Let me be clear, the GME was to make Tendies. Taking out a hedge fund was a bonus not the purpose because we know the game is rigged. It's what it is. Unless you have a trillion dollar, you are not likely to change wall street for retail traders and retards. When GME took off and went viral, truly mentally challenged people of reddit homepage jumped on it and it has been transformed into a "movement". TVs, newspapers show this as little guys take on wall street and Elon Musk and Mark Cuban supported this(positions or ban?talk is cheap) I read bunch of comments and got heartbroken that people got in to make money and destroy hedge funds. Now, GME is the only thing. We have lost Tesla gang,Palantir gang,Palenton gang,theta gang who had provided real DD and were the people who came up with GME along with many other trades. Those people made WSB a place where retards gamble but with some sort of fundamental that can increase you change from 0 to   Now we cannot hear them due to noise.  Now, the sub is filled with people who just yell "HOLD!!!!!" "BUY MORE" "WHO HOLDS????" "GME WILL GO TO MOON". I hope it does and people who got fucked recover. BUT THIS REDUCES THE SUB INTO A SINGLE TRADE where previously there were chances you can actually hear new retarded things that could make you money. Guess who benefits from this current state? GME Diamond Hands with $1000? or Wall St. who is playing carrot on a stick.  A hedge fund made $700M on GME. Citadel who has shady relationships with Robinhood made tons of money as market maker because of insane increase of volume. A lot of hedge funds shorted at $300s and made millions. And we are bombarded with truly stupid posts of "WHO HOLDS GME????$5000 IS NOT A MEME" I'd love hearing DDs like DFVs and explain the game plan but these people are actually retards. They just yell some slogans and getting emotional. Sharing the old finra report won't help US.  I wholeheartedly hope that GME holders are right, it goes to $5000 and makes millions. I'd be happy for them but if we narrow to one trade (or BANG), we actually give up millions of TENDIES on other trades. We don't get new info. We don't get new DDs. Please stop spamming and provide actual DD so it can actually bring people back on GME if you are right. This would help you too.  We need to find our next GMEs. That's how you make TENDIES. We need retards who got stuff right like messiah DFV so we can win. Everytime we make a good trade, you actually fight off the rigged system.  tl;dr: GME narrows down us to a single trade. We need to restore our DNA and get DDs,reduce noise and hear new things that can make us TENDIES. Otherwise GME can be cancerous to this sub which holds you back to make TENDIES  Thank you for reading and now fuck off
Why not use the power of y’all Reddit apes and wall streets for good shit?

How long til all the Q-GmeOn Shaman give up and move on?
I plan to make a bit of money off these idiots as they pump the stocks every morningbefore they run out of funds, but how long is that really possible? At what point is it rude to take the tendies and leave them with the bags?
Just gotta say
Ya'll are a pretty decent group, retards, autists, apes, and all.  Yes I know this isn't the kind of post this forum is for and I'm sorry but there aren't many places where my sense of humor is appreciated so I just wanted to acknowledge that.  Also it makes me gleeful seeing the 'diamonds are a girl's best friend' tagline picking up, looking good ladies!  /Sappyness

GME holders got skunked 🦨🦨🦨
Let's level here. We all fell in love with the idea of retail investors sticking it to greedy hedge funds. GME value was hyped into an undisputed bubble, because people wanted to see the narrative come true. I see people with diamond hands calling to hold despite losing over 80%, but let's be honest, holding doesn't make stock prices go up. You need buyers for it to go up. And people are out of money. The smart players bought low and sold high.  You can tell me to fuck off and that you'll laugh at me when GME rebounds, but I feel sorry for the people who bought at $300+ and got hella skunked.
Dfv needs to plead the fifth at the Congressional hearing. Not because he did anything illegal, but because the elite want to tar and feather him.
U/deepfuckingvalue needs to plead the fifth at the Congressional hearing. These people are out to get him.   He took billions of dollars from the elite and they want their pound of flesh.   If he talks to them, it's only so they can trap him or hit him for some rule violation. His testimony will not help them 'fix' the system. They are out to get him period.   They are already looking into his mass mutual job and if he violated and security rules because he holds a license. This is utter nonsense as from what I've seen, he has not broken any laws or rules.  U/deepfuckingvalue please, if you testify make a prepared opening statement and then clam up and say to each question, "on the advice of counsel, I invoke the fifth amendment". You owe them nothing and they, the elite, are not your friends.
So just to divert attention away from the complete tom-fuckery of the last few weeks, how's Tesla going?
No DD here, just a thought.   Tesla shares have been pretty volatile, and for the last 3 weeks its been jumping between 800 and 900, but is yet to see any serious gainz. My theory is that with how the last few weeks have gone, tesla hasn't really felt the love of this subreddit, and it showing it. So I would expect that as the current hype of the stock that shall not be named dies down, tesla will be getting its much needed attention back, and with it bouncing off the 900 mark a few times, the retards of WSB will be more than enough to break the 900.   Currently at 852. Potentially 950-1000 by end of month?  Edit: not sure why, but I am not able to see all of the comments, currently can onyl see 5 out of 13. So, like I would reply but yeah...

First time posting. Am I doing this right?
What if we are underestimating the size of the GME powder keg?
Purely speculation but given how absolutely excessive the hedge funds, DTCC, and brokers have tried to keep GME from squeezing, I'm wondering if we've completely underestimated the damage a real GME squeeze might do?  Do we actually know what the real OTC short interest is at and can we trust the reported number? What if it's 10x or 100x higher, we'd have no idea. If the short squeeze actually happened, which is a theoretical infinite squeeze, drive the GME price so some ridiculous million dollar mark, even if briefly?  Melvin will go bankrupt, sure, but they're a pretty small fish, it seems excessive to do all this manipulation to save a fledging hedge fund unless the brokers, DTCC, maybe even the entire market is under threat, causing the coordinates attacks we're seeing in an effort to diffuse this.  We also haven't heard a peep from anything from inside these organizations or hedges, it feels like a strict gag order is in effect and the one insider post (if you believe it) seems to paint a picture of an absolute panic inside the financial system, which again seems excessive if only a few smaller hedges like Melvin are being taken down.
Started literally at the bottom. With a few hundred down. I’ve been able to survive because I made some good investments. Too be honest I have won 1 call option and lost like 8. Don’t waste your time or money, invest in stocks.
Discussion: Hot take my losses straight into $JETS
Since technically I don’t have $2500 into this, I cannot “YOLO” but I feel like $1000 is yolo-ed enough for my small wallet.   Coming back from RONA, I believe that airline companies have the unprecedented opportunity to recover drastically from the pandemic and make a MOONFULL of profits after successful rollout of the vaccine.   Points:  - United Airlines is already delivering large quantities of vaccine from overseas, and partners with Clorox to keep their planes squeaky (1)  - AA has expanded domestic and international testing for its passengers to make travel seamless to highly popular leisure destinations, and announcing more promising data from 2020 seeing less losses than expected (2)   - Delta Airlines has stated that they will keep middle seats blocked until the end of March, and they have kept their daily cash flown burn to about $10mil a day (just think what their profits will do when they open up that middle seat) (3/4)   - Southwest Airlines unfortunately has posted its first loss in the company’s HISTORY, but stands to profit off of losses as leisure travel still dominates (which is their whole operation). Also, they continue to shift focus on opening new destinations across the United States DURING RONA (5)  - Frontier and Spirit Airlines are making enough profit to continue their pilot hiring, which in turn, leads to more flights being flown (6)  All said and done, people WILL want to keep traveling after this is said and done. Airlines stand to make MAD MONEY profit as flight loads from not only shipping the vaccine, but filling up with leisure travelers starts happening  best case scenario  late Q2 or mid Q3 (you can already see this as big airlines are flying fuller large wide body jets to places like Florida and Mexico).   Loss to riches all in to JETS baby, let’s make that comeback COME BACk! I’ll be going in every paycheck until I can post that YOLO flair.  tldr; Travel come back, Airlines make money, yay  Citations  1.    2.    3.    4.    5.    6.
DOWN   gs BUT STILL HOLDING
LETS FUCKING GO U MONKEYS. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. THIS IS TRENCH WARFARE AND THE BAD GUYS HAVE TRENCH FOOT!!
Realization
Are people actually starting to wake up now? Are people actually starting to realize that this whole thing was sheer luck and it was only a matter of time before the ACTUAL veterans of the stock market would put an end to this? This is it, if you’re still holding you lost. If you sold congratulations on not letting morons that think they know how to play the market fool you into holding.
POWER TO THE PLAYERS BABY! CANT WAIT TO WATCH THE WSB MOVIE AT MY LOCAL AMC!!!
Real talk abou my GME
I’m pretty much over the hype. Lost two grand and I can see a lot of people lost more. Do you really think that this is a thing or are you all just trying to hype yourselves up every five minutes to keep yourselves from just fucking killing yourselves?   Like everyone keeps saying it’s ladder attacks and shit but come on. We all know everyone is selling like wtf are you talking about. Super tight but it’s my own fault and again I know people lost a lot worse than me.   But honestly who has any proof this shit ain’t already dead and done
GME Fatigue
Look, I like GME just as much as the next guy       ✊ etc. I’m still holding and buying dips but the ONLY thing I see is GME posts. Is this just me or do multiple people feel the same way.
Coincidentally, -21,  is my favourite number.
Could've moved out of my parents house but at least I don't got no paper hands
Terms and conditions... y’all dun fucked up.
So uhhh, y’all are angry at RH, but, and hear me out you sick banbot mods, see RH terms and conditions section 13 and 16. And also the agreement to arbitration. All of this is a contract we signed when joining RH. I’d drop a ‘lmgtfy’ but it’s all perfectly written in your app. Hit the person in the bottom right. Go to help. Hit Robinhood terms, then post your loss porn because if you’re reading this that’s all you have left.  TLDR: South Park blah blah blah terms and conditions you damned dirty apes.   PS: if this gets removed it’s market manipulation because you are removing relevant information from the apes. 🤓📚📚

GME short percentage question
I know the short percentage is supposed to come out next Tuesday the 9th. Is anybody able to tell me at what time during the day or the best place to see this information?
What do y'all think the GME stock will end up looking like after the dust settles?
Do you guys think that the stock will rise before falling again? Or rise and stay at a high price? Or crash??   I really want to see people's predictions :)
Numbers don't lie. If you look at who made money then you need to consider that this whole GME thing was probably engineered by hedge funds (Citadel & SAC) to suck in retail. Retail short squeezing a hedge fund was the only narrative that could have allowed them to sell GME for $300.
Citadel has access to Robinhood's order flow, their whole business model is to front run you, so what are the chances that a short squeeze flies under their radar? After the "squeeze" Melvin received fresh capital, they never got squeezed. WSB lost money. This was probably a set up by SAC & Citadel to squeeze retail with GME. While everyone here was going all in hoping to stick it to Wall street someone else was unloading worthless GME shares for $300. Then they continued from $300 down to $50 while WSB was being advised to hold with diamond hands or to buy more, adding even more liquidity for whoever was exiting.  In the end you guys became famous and lost money, while hedge funds made money but were  humiliated .  Edit: Till this morning accounts with less than 1500 couldn't comment, now they can suddenly comment again since I posted this and another post about extreme silver positioning.   This subreddit is captured by hedge funds, the SEC needs to investigate admins and all reddit logs about the activity here. These guys engineered a PnD (gme) and hid it in plain sight by making it look like retail short squeezed a hedge fund.   SEC are you watching???!  Edit 2: grammar
MGNI has been printing all month but today was good. Earnings are on 2/24. I sold these and opened $60C 3/19.
Honestly, was there any other play?
We should stop sharing and commenting our positions in here and anywhere
If HFs can keep their positions secret then we should as well so they don't know where we stand.   All they need to know is we're not selling
BB Stock
As I sit patiently on my GME and AMC stock I have been looking at a few others and the one I am probably most interested in is BlackBerry. I am, however, on the fence. Can anyone here give me their reasons or justifications why they think it is a good stock to invest in? Maybe your reasons will tip me into it.
I Believe.
I know you guys don't give real advice but beware of RH...
This can't be   deactivated my account 5 days ago, then put my entire portfolio on margin immediately even though there was cash covering over 80%. Well for days I've emailed and requested access they don't respond. The issue was somehow they fd a deposit and cause it to be blocked. On the first day after they deactivated they put me in a margin call(of course). So my $5000 portfolio only had $4000 to cover investments. I attempted to deposit cash countless times to cover the $1000. Well today they sold all GME and AMC assets(even though I have 2 others that weren't sitting @80% loss that could have been sold to more than cover) so now I have no GME and lost most AMC @ +80% loss. Then what do you know the option to reactive was given literally in the window where the Margin call appeared IMMEDIATELY after the margin call.   TL DR:  RH fucked up a bank transfer  RH then deactivated and put cash backed shares on margin(with no ability to reactivate)  RH then did a margin call  RH sold +80% losses  RH immediately gave option to reactivate after sell.   RH is actually a fucking scam. They play so fucking dirty.  Edit: because I think you guys are missing my point. THEY DEACTIVATED THE ACCOUNT AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO COVER UNTIL IMMEDIATELY AFTER SELLING. I EMAILED AND REQUESTED ACCESS MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY EVERYDAY. I'm still deactivated 6 days from initial deactivation with emails from them on day 1 saying they would respond I'm 1-3 business days with NO FUCKING RESPONSE.
$CHGG (Cheating Chegg) Puts--A Decent Opportunity
I got most of the answers for this DD from some Indian guy on Chegg, and copied them word for word.  Alright, so Chegg has recently broke the $100 wall and has nicely ran up to an ATH before its earnings after market close on Monday.  I believe that it's going to tank immediately after earnings. Why? Well, obviously their subscriber, revenue, and profit numbers are going to be great. Hell, everyone's been cheating with Chegg lately, paying $15 a month to access shitty homework answers.  Nonetheless, they released similar spectacular numbers in October 2020, and immediately tanked from 87 to 77. Why? Because back then, they foresaw their growth slowing down in 2021. The slowing growth projections caused them to tank in the short term before recovering.  Recent earnings from Unity ($U) and Peloton ($PTON), for example, are showing that even with stellar profits, PERFECT future guidance is important right now. Both of those ran up to earnings. Both nose-dived right after. And with Chegg diving on its last 2 run-ups to earnings, I don't see why this time will be any different.   TL;DR:  Chegg is running up to an all-time high before earnings. The reopening of schools in the somewhat-near future will probably provide a slight   to its growth projections. Last 2 earnings tanked from ATH's for the same reason. Recent earnings like Unity and Peloton show even slightly toned-down growth projections tank the stock despite good profits. A put debit spread is the way to go with this one.   Positions:  $CHGG 2/19 100/105 Put Debit Spread for $260 (selling 2/19 $100P, buying 2/19 $105P)   You could also YOLO the 2/19 $90P for $200. If the stock tanks, it's probably going to at least $90. If it soars, well, the puts are fucked anyway.
Change of dialect. Will wsb speak with a new tongue?
This really is a humorous place. I just read how some one complained that we don’t call our selves retarted now instead we are apes strong.   I have a problem with this.   Before I ever joined wsb I had dumped thousands in penny stocks for 300% gain but would have been happy taking 10% instead of -70%.   Then I started buying FD’s before knowing what they were. You know $20 calls for GE and Ford . Don’t get me started with tsla weeklies especially before the split. You know when you could think of getting rich buying a $2000 call option when tsla was $9-1200  Anyways I said to my self that I was dumb as shit and it was clear when it came to the market I was “retarted”   I don’t think it really echoed to my personal life that it was that stupid but it was great reflection of self. Maybe the way I trade stocks is really the reason I’m fucked up in life.   Idk but I would still continue to buy fd’s the following Monday. And if I lost which of course I did I could come here and laugh with the community. Be happy someone else was a worst trader then me or just more naive.   This is a great group with a certain type of risk takers that is unlike any thing I’ve ever seen. And yes majority of these risk are on fd’s that will never print but the beauty is when we count up potential profits. In our minds we have came up with the recipe for success. Unfortunately we just picked the wrong expy and striker. Who would of thought.  Yet we can spit more game on premium then the herd mentality who’ve never even had nuts to invest or trade rather, investing is easy (Hence the 401k)  In close I hope the language of this place stays the same. I don’t want to go to another wallstreetbets make up. That would be weird. It would be equally weird to watch this place change how we discuss topics.  I’ve been here for almost a year. I don’t know if it’s just the way you speak when your on Reddit but this sub has a certain way you speak where it just clicks with a certain side of your mental. Either it’s your or not and you get it or not. Only a certain type of people can laugh at smooth brain jokes and relate.   What do you think? If we stop calling our selves retards and we view are losses in a more politically correct way will we stop trying to hit it big. Since the conservative approach is 10-15% a year?  Edit   I may have worded something wrong. I like being a retard I know that I will be smarter one day and make better decisions. Right now I’m still trying to figure out why my gme calls for March 5 300 and 350 will make or not
The Karma farming has gotten out of hand

Loss porn Down 29k this week doubled down on every position on Thursday to cut my average cost
GME
Is anyone else sick of only seeing Gamestop on this forum and AMC? I mean like I have only been a part of this sub for a year but at least beforehand it was people losing money or gaining money in multiple stocks. Especially when the “squeeze” already happened. Before people would post good DD and their was more to this sub than just “ApE bUy ThIS”. Someone show me some gains or loss porn on something else Jesus. Probably just get downvoted but seriously come on GME was up 8,000 percent at one point, do you really believe here shortly it’s going to do that again?
The emerging agricultural LED tech market
Grow light technology is rapidly evolving beyond simply growing plants indoors with the prevalent "full spectrum" marketing slogan. There are many specially tuned light type arrays and intervals, which effect everything from livestock behavior/growth speed and the color/taste of produce.  There's a major growth opportunity with this tech, coupled with emerging environmental and sociopolitical climates, such as:    Climate change is shifting the tropical rain belts in the Eastern hemisphere (Europe/Asia) more northern per the recent  : where there's less sunlight on average, forcing LED adoption to offset crop loss from shorter days, particularly in subarctic regions.   Climate instability: with flooding, drought, etc. climate patterns becoming harder to predict, both livestock and plant growth need moderately reliable patterning to accurately meet future agricultural output goals and projections.   There's a growing demand for stable food security and production across Asia, as a matter of national security, especially in the wake of pandemic food supply chain disruptions.  Plants and livestock both benefit from specifically tuned LED color combos, which effect growth speeds, enhanced flavors, etc. and where a few companies are now innovating.  Additionally as user   PhotoMacro1   states:  >PhD in plant science here. Another big source of revenue will be using Red and Blue LED light post harvest. Even in grocery stores.  This snippet from the Everlight Electronics   is pretty good TLDR of the space:  >In 2019, Everlight's newly formed optoelectronic R&D team introduced tunable LEDs to maximize animal husbandry and aquaculture.   >   >For instance in poultry farming, exposing a chicken to white light takes 172 days to reach reproductive maturity, while exposing to red light reduces to 168 days, but blue light increases maturity to 182 days. Green light exposure makes poultry gain weight faster, due to growth hormone receptor stimulation and enhancement of satellite glial cells which promote muscle development.   >   >The R&D team also introduced UV LEDs for eggshell surface sanitization and water disinfection for waste water runoff. In collaboration with Dr. Kun-Hsien Tsai, Professor at College of Public Health at National Taiwan University, a novel ovitrap was introduced which pulses Ultraviolet C to regularly destroy collected mosquito eggs.   >   >In 2020, Everlight collaborated with Professor Wang Yong-song’s team of the Institute of Fisheries Science, National Taiwan University to develop a special LED   for grouper fish aquaculture, where specific wavelength exposure reduces cannibalization and loss of fingerlings by over 40%.   >   >In 2021, Everlight released new horticultural LEDs in spectrums tailored to augment the red pigment of strawberries. Strawberries rely on sunlight to produce their red color through a process called anthocyanin biosynthesis, but in areas with little sunlight horticultural LEDs can be used to catalyze this biochemical process instead.  Major players (public companies):                   Major players (private companies):    Valoya   Lumigrow   Illumitex  For more context,   details more on one area of emerging research into far-red LED light for plant development.    Positions:   3k shares in Everlight Electronics due to their global exposure, particularly in China.  This is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor.

Hope to Hold for Now and Forever
Since many a ape will lose bananas and their own sanity throughout the weekend. I find it useful for any that are giving into negativity by the hands that give hand-jobs with the quality grip of paper, to realise GME is not just a mere speculative bubble anymore but a plausible and prosperous business model with longevity in mind. Here is an extract from a research paper of what to think about while you hold with those diamond hands of yours. If you must get further approval from your wife’s boyfriend then do so but make your own choices.  “Although the years-long short thesis implies a terminal value of zero (bankruptcy), we see this outcome as virtually impossible given the current state of GameStop’s financials, incoming console revenue, and proven ecommerce results trajectory. In fact, our analysis clearly shows 3 distinct paths to profitability:  • A Bear Case ($  tracking the existing “GameStop Reboot” initiative, with successful footprint rationalization to 2,000 stores in North America by 2023, steady ecommerce contribution, and a continued market decline in physical games not offset by major business model updates.  • A Base Case ($  that is similar, but with a material increase in ecommerce revenue contribution, plus greater impact from digital revenue sharing with vendors, and some participation in other digital-first businesses.  • A Bull Case ($  based on a full transition by 2025 to the ecommerce- first “cultural gaming hub” hinted at by Ryan Cohen, with a significant increase in revenue attributed to ecommerce, new vendor partnerships, meaningful participation in the advertising revenue pool for gaming, and growth acceleration in the overall TAM for gaming.”   Source:     I need to confess I sold as the doubt kicked in and the paper hands got to me. So that makes me a paper hand chimp now (forgive me). My hands may have became paper, however I promise I will turn these disgusting so-called hands back into beautiful diamonds by holding till they touch the dark side of the moon to repent for my sin.   Mandatory Emojis:      📈  💰🤑  I do need to say I have lost more money in life than I’ve made, with very poor life choices resulting in further poor outcomes. As such, I am not and never will be qualified to be a financial advisor and everything I wrote is fictional at best.

Grimy Tactics Exposed
I don’t give a shit about your wholesome story regarding your gains
It’s the most cringe shit ever, post it in r/all or r/wholesome cuz that’s where it belongs. I’ve literally seen motherfuckers post “I paid off my chemo with my GME gains” or “I finally have enough to buy my first car because of GME” and “thanks to GME I can finally pay for my sisters wedding”.... NOBODY FUCKING CARES!!! I literally guarantee you maybe 1% of pre 2020 WSB users care. This is not a place for you to share you heart warming story about how your life turned around. People here make $200k all the time. And you know what they do. Post a screenshot of their account and that’s it. Cuz that’s all it’s about. Literally take your karma farming bullshit elsewhere you NPC’s  📉📉📉

Bots or Real People: People Crying on Personal Finance of Losing Money?
I follow a few personal finance subreddits and keep on seeing different stories of people putting all their life savings into "meme" stocks.  I just can't shake the feeling that these are written by bots/HF people. Have the same sob story  Thoughts?
SEARS IPO
This will be a good way to root out some bots but does anyone have any info on SEARS and when it’s scheduled to IPO? Any impending news that would affect it?
Alternative communities
Hello boiz/girls  The whole gme and the combination of my new job got me back into investing. Now i am looking for active communities that like to discuss the market and give advice etc.   Are there any groups/pages/communities you guys can recommend for me?
If you hold GME for a loss just claim it as a loss on taxes (even more reason to hold)
I bet half you retards didnt know if you dont hold GME for long enough you cant claim the loss from GME on 2021 taxes.  Also fuck you im not a tax professional or financial advisor i'm some fucking moron who willingly threw 300$ for a share of GameStop because I felt like loosing money, thats what we fucking do here, Buy high sell low, and never sell.  So dont be an autist and hold your damn GME stop being a paper handed baby and claim that loss (if the squeeze has indeed sqoze) on your taxes you dumbass
Should I do it or am I too late?
Seriously we just put $400 in an account for stocks. It finally went through. Should we still do it? We don't know what the hell is going on... I know I'm dumb. I'm just hoping somebody who actually knows what they're doing will be kind enough to tell two unemployed people whether they should spend $400 on this or not.
Anyone has any ideea what this could mean ?
$RKT   mortgage
Remember this ticker?  I’ve been watching it for a while.  It’s been basing since it’s IPO in August and been largely rangebound.  We’ve got earnings coming up on the 25th.  They make good money and rates are low.  Everyone is refinancing.  That means more business for  .  This week we ended up after bouncing off of $21.  The previous base was $20.  We also saw a brief poking out on this run up above the range.  Volume is also picking up over the last 2 weeks.  Also seeing more articles popping up.  I’m hoping this is the dip to load the truck.  Positions: Im up to 525 shares and $1500 in contracts ranging from next week to 2023. (So 11500 total, mini yolo). I’ll add more when it breaks out.  TL/CR

WSB has been taken hostage by new mods allowing bots and fake accounts overrun the sub with GME hate #GME
The only reason the narrative would change so drastically is because of this. Watch my post get bombarded with extremely hateful, disrespectful, fear mongering comments. The mods have been compromised nobody on this sub can be trusted anymore and all of you should know that now. STAY STRONK GME STONK    👾💦📈
Something seems off about this volume difference. Could just be me 🤔
Why are posts being removed?
All of a sudden I see posts, especially those about GME, being removed which wasn't the case until this couple of
Investing Resources
I’m a newbie here, but is there discussion somewhere about good stocks to invest in other than GameStop memes? Does anyone have any investing resources for someone new to it?
🏻  GME 500c 2/5
A letter to WSB, from an elite.
You all have failed. It is time to give up now, go back to your jobs and continue working for us untill you get too old to continue, then you have our permission to live off of $1,000 social secruity checks and in poverty untill your dying breath. You know why me and others were born rich? Our fathers and mothers realized that there are people born to live in filth, and there are those like my family who are simply gods among men. We own the average worker, we are the reason you are able to feed your families. Dont even think about getting into our game, the stock market is too deep for you too swim.   Really you all should feel lucky to be able to have anything at all, but we do need you  sigh  your labor is the only reason we can relax all day and trully enjoy our one time exhistence guilt free 🙂 keep working and don't forget, Walmart has a deal going on with chips, make sure you get them for the super bowl party!
So are we gonna make a sub dedicated to finding the next meme stock or just do it here
"Get your GME shirt and show the world that you're at the front!" Whomst of you motherfuckers did this? :D
Can WSB build a wall and deport every $GME pusher?
It’s true, and WSB used to have the best and the finest. When $GME sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people  But I speak to WSB and they tell us what we’re getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They’re sending us not the right people.  It’s coming from more than $GME. It’s coming from $AMC and $BB, and it’s coming probably— probably— from $NOK too. But we don’t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. And it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast.
If you dont think Hedge funds can possibly buy reddit accounts look no further after (  seconds) seconds of intense research.
they sell some here, if its that easy for me to find some im pretty sure they can get a fuck ton.  Edit: someone also posted google trends of "reddit accounts to buy"
AMC?   🍿   or 💩
Simple question: AMC, sell or hold?   I was under the impression that this was a movement, to send a message to the big guys but now it seems like a flash in the pan type deal. Well at least it was fun while it lasted...   Peace and love peeps!
NOK’s NEW SHORT INTEREST
As of today the short float is up 16%... I know we all thought this wasn’t a short squeeze play but it might’ve just joined the squeeze gang. Let me know you thoughts 🤔
Wow, the narrative is finally changing. Maybe a bunch of retards that think $2000 is life altering money don't have the capital to manipulate a stock
What's stopping brokers from restricting trade again?

Just a little pit stop on our way to the moon!

Got a problem with Robinhood? Let me know here.
I saw a couple of threads as I started to investigate, and I'm starting to think my issue is shared by many people recently. I'd like to get everyone together to confirm their experiences and how we are going to get our issues resolved. Any issue at all.  I moved my account out of RH last week and my shares and options showed up after 5 days, but along came a 4000 dollar debit which I can't explain. I'm now on margin with my new broker who also doesn't know what this charge is. Come Monday I'll start paying interest on some margin I never had. My RH account had margin disabled and was just shares, a few options, and a little bit of cash. Where's the 4k from? Where's the 700 from that this poor mook in /r/robinhood is missing? Where's the 2k the other one is missing?  I saw posts on /r/robinhood and /r/robinhoodtrades that aren't going to get traction because they're tiny subs and the mods there don't want any discussion except for gains threads. Fuck em. Post on WSB. There's 8 million retards here that make up a large portion of RH's clients.  RH does not have a phone number to call. Put in an email on their support page, tell everyone here, tweet them, email them again, complain wherever you want. If we can't get answers, we're going to file with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We're going to tweet Vlad and he can reply from jail.  Fuck Robinhood. You owe me 4000 dollars, whatever was in cash at time of transfer which you haven't given me a statement on, all the money from any liquidated partial shares and whatever percentage on margin I end up owing to TDA. I'm gonna get my fucking money. Cuz I want my margin cleared up so I can buy more meme stocks.
GME & The Tale of The Retarded Apes.
Stop with the ape crap.
It’s in your best interest to stop acting like a bunch of dumb sheep who bought GME simply because they were following WSB, DFV, or the crazy FOMO price action.   That stupid ape narrative will only be used to “protect you” with more trading restrictions for the lower classes. Think of the part time day trading rules, which make it harder to make money, but worse.   If you’re new here, “apes together strong” was never a thing until the last couple weeks. It showed up with all the new people (bots?). Before then, we called people retards, not as a sign of strength in numbers, but to make fun of people that think they understand the market and get burned.   I mean, yeah, it’s a joke about us being dumb. But along with loss porn, it’s a reminder to fucking be careful. Anything could happen. Use risk management.  This is a fucking casino. You could be right about some stupid stock going up 5% tomorrow. Or the whole god damned market could crash, and you’ll just be another loser down 20%, regardless of your amazing DD.   We all know the risks.   So don’t whine about losing all your money. Don’t ask for handouts on this sub, because you risked more than you could lose. More than anything, stop acting like ignorance makes you strong. It never did.   It’s your money. You made grown up decisions. Own your losses. Don’t let legislation take more freedoms away from us within the “free market” to protect us, the ‘poor dumb apes.’  WSB is being scapegoated for this fiasco, even though many of us had good reasons to invest in GME. The thing that wasn’t accounted for by most people was the sudden restriction on buying for multiple days until all momentum died. The ability for brokers to abruptly make that decision needs to be challenged.  So pull yourself together and do some research about the way brokers created an artificial selling pressure to push the price down. Then, maybe contact your state representatives with something more coherent than diamond hands and ape noises.  Edit: typos because it’s 1am, I’m tired and retarded.
This sub is going to die.
Old mod coup and massive influx of new users= dead sub  been here a long time and its sad to see the sub go like this.
So what about the GameStop business model makes GME a good buy? Or is it simply a meme stock?
I mean seriously, GameStop has been slowly becoming the Blockbuster Video of gaming and people are thinking that GME is a longterm investment.  They have been closing down stores left and right.  Get at me
RH hate is dumb and misguided.
Stop crying about RH, your GME movement is crying about RH and touting sticking it to the billionaires, meanwhile RH only folded in that moment because they are a smaller new platform with no where near as much $ - I’m sure if RH could have afforded to continuing letting retail consumers buy shares they would have - then you all flocked to multi-billion dollar brokers while claiming you hate the 1%
"Hold" means "moon" in Hungarian. And my auto correct changes "Hold" to "Gold" frequently. I love GME! Go RC!!

No more GME
Dearest Tards,  While you have your breakfast of glue covered crayons, I’d like you to hear my suggestion.   My girlfriends husband is in this sub and all he’s been doing this past weeks is reading the GME threads and claiming to know exactly what the price of GME ought to be. He’s never visited yahoo finance, and doesn’t even know what an investor relations section is. He listens to Robinhood Snacks podcast which is where he gets all his stock advice from.   The GME thread is all he is counting on, and it’s giving him an unrealistic expectation that this play is a “sure thing” rather than realizing it’s one of the riskiest bets currently available on the market.   What’s even more retarded, him and his boys club can not stop publicly announcing every single thought thats on their mind, which means every single player on Wall Street can see exactly how to manipulate these apes.   The GME thread made sense last week when it got filled 4 times with 100k comments (the limit), but today, it’s an invitation to advertise you’re retardedness and it does more harm than good.   If newbies need a GME thread to ask questions on, well guess what, every fucking question has already been answered if you just use the fucking search bars. This subreddit is very well organized and we don’t need an extra retarded thread.   TLDR: no more GME thread. It’s an invitation to coordinate and let’s HF see exactly what you are thinking.
This is easy weight boys, keep fucking holding you damn dirty APES
Where did all the retards go?
I’m gone for one month, done nothing but wank , drink and work like 70 hours at my day job , all been one fucking blur  I hear this game shit and ignore it , fucking Normies . I think to myself , texting my wife’s boyfriend and drinking my moo moo milkshake.   I go on wsb , it’s been a while. The first comment I see is someone saying the word retard is inappropriate .   The hairs on my ballsack stand on end and I know something is wrong   I look further in dismay . Paper shares , congratulating each other ? What is this an investing subreddit?   Mods pls fix   Also everyone get calls on google , shits about to explode          Edit : Martin Shkreli is a hero , NESTLE is Goat , fuck dem kids
Cramer is working hard to take down videos of his admission to securities manipulating in a 2006 interview
Plenty of you degenerates have seen the interview from 2006 where Jim Cramer talks about about stock manipulation being a "fun game" from his hedge fund days. He goes as far as saying the SEC isn't smart enough  to go after hedge funds for fomenting, or feeding false news to the media to stir up uncertainty for retail. It's basically 11 minutes of him bragging about his past and saying that you won't make it if you don't employ illegal tactics. What does that tell you about how wide-spread this is in the industry? Now extrapolate that 15 years and here we are today.  All the videos have since been taken down within the last day or two by The Street.  "What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth to develop a fiction. And, um, the fiction is developed by almost anybody who's down."  Everyone have a good hard think about this. This guy's got coke sniffles while he spits in the face of the SEC and every retail investor in the stock market. He's allowed to continue without consequence, yet we see people like DeepFuckingValue getting railed in the media and being asked to testify because it fits the desired narrative even though the dude did nothing wrong and should be allowed to live peacefully.  I met Jim Cramer over a decade ago. Can confirm he is a prick.  EDIT: Here is a transcript of first 2 minutes 40 seconds of the interview if you can't watch the video (in comments). It goes on for another 8 but this should be enough for your ape attention spans:    A:   Welcome to Wallstreet Confidential, I'm Aaron Tass(?), joined again by Jim Cramer. Jim, Welcome    Cramer:   Good to see ya.    A:   Thanks for being here. Uh, so, economic data out today but wanna talk about something else first. Again today we have the misdirection from the futures. The futures pointing up in market. as of right now it's actually down again. Is this just because it's the holiday period that we're seeing this?    Cramer:   You know, a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund, and I was position short, meaning I needed it down, I would create a level of activity before hand that could drive the futures. It doesn't take much money. Similarly, or if I were long and wanted to make things a little bit rosy, I would go and take a bunch of stocks and make sure they were higher. Maybe commit 5 million in capital to do it and I could effect it. What you're seeing now is probably a bigger market, maybe you need 10 million to knock the stuff down. But it's a fun game, and it's a lucrative game. You can move it up and then fade it, that often creates a very negative feel. So let's say you take a longer term view intra-day and you say listen, I'm gonna boost the futures and when the real sellers comes in I'm gonna knock it down and it's gonna create a negative view. That's a strategy very worth doing. When you're valuing on a day to day basis. I would encourage anyone who's in a hedge fund to do it, because it's legal. And it uh, is a very quick way to make money. And very satisfying. And by the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that but I don't care. And I can't - I'm not gonna say it on TV.    A:   There's so many more hedge funds today than when you were managing yours. Do you think that exacerbates the moves or makes it tougher?    Cramer:   Well, you know, the hedge funds are positioned long-short. They're not just long like mutual funds. So it's really vital these next 6 days cuz of your pay day, you really gotta control the market. You can't let it lift. When you've got research in motion(?) it's really important to use a lot of your firepower to knock that down because it's the fulcrum of the market today. So let's say I were short, what I would do is I would hit a lot of guys with RIM, now you can't foment. That's a violation of, of..    A:   Ferment? (lol)    Cramer:   Yeah, you can't FOment. You can't create, yourself, an impression that a stock's down. But you do it anyway because the SEC doesn't understand it. So, I mean that's the only sense I would say this is illegal. But a hedge fund not up a lot really has to do a lot to save itself. So, this is different from what I was talking about in the beginning where I'd be buying the Q's and stuff. This is actually just blatantly illegal. But when you have 6 days and your company may be in doubt because you're down, I think it's really important to foment if I were one of these guys.

Short Squeezing For Dummies
1. Don't only hold the line, buy more 📈 2. Buy at market price, that makes the price go up   3. 10 million apes x 10 shares on average each = 100 million shares 🌕 4. As price goes up again, the new shorts will have to cover, they'll start buying up again, helping us 🤜🍋🤛 <- squeezing 5. They get squeezed by the balls AGAIN - this time they won't be able to make 100 million synthetic shares to cover their stupid corrupt bottoms 📉 6. You fight the MAN, you get a bit of money again, maybe it triggers a collapse of the global financial system, maybe it motivates some institutions around the world to FIX certain problems - win/win/win/win 7.

GME Apes -vs- Robinhood
Make the hedgies hurt
I got $650 in WeBull. I was gonna put it back into my bank account. Should I YOLO it into GME or AMC?
I already lost $500 on GME. But I’m down to buy the dip if you guys think the squeeze hasn’t squoze.   YOLO?
The fuck happened here... We were supposed to go to the moon..
RIP GME, hopefully we'll be back one day...
Predictions for GameStop stocks
—> !!I am 4 days old into stock trading and inventing, I am not a money professional in just a 13yo with a theory!! <— !! DONT WASTE ALL YOU MONEY INTO GAMESTOP STOCKS JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAID, I AM 4D OLD INTO STOCK INVESTING!! . . 4days ago GameStop stocks were very high, At a high peak,3 days ago the stocks fell to red and people were either rushing to sell their stocks or memeing to hold, 2 days ago the stocks Risen to a high and now today they have been hovering above the red line, I expect by tomarow the stocks to be deep in the red (The past data from IPhone Stocks app show after every GameStop rise their is a deep fall) and the day after tomarow the stocks to spike High up because after every fall their is in GameStop stocks their is a spike
Need help.
New ape but I'm in a very good position to do my DD in investing. I'm retired and disabled at 40 with income to invest as well as learn how to read all the pertinent data about a company to make informed decisions. I have a decent understanding of stocks and I'm really great at math and data. My question is where do I start finding great info to go deeper into stocks to go full retard? Don't need a complete ELI5, but deeper dive into the nitty gritty. Thanks.

Hey guys! I’m COMPLETELY NEW TO INVESTING and I found out about here cause of the GameStop situation. I’m a relatively low risk investor (until I learn more) and I could use ANY help y’all could offer like what stock to look into, and how to determine when a good time to invest/sell is?  Also any other recommendations or any books to read would be most helpful.   Currently I’m using Robinhood as my app to invest. Any thing better?so far I believe I’ve made $  in the past 3 days to give an idea how I’ve been doing Thanks  Edit: according to the rude comments, this isn’t the place to learn. Literally had no idea before I made the post. I don’t understand why y’all are acting “superior than though” about the face that I’m green. I don’t think any of you knew anything about investing when you first started. Please have some common courtesy
It's easier to short a 400$ stock than to short a 15$ stock.
I feel like most people took their profits on $GME because it DID squeeze. It wasn't a gamma squeeze because it is NOT the same as the $VW stock.  Because in that case, Porche owned like 80% of the shares, and Porche it's a UNIT, it's a company, 1 person can coordinate it. But because we are a lot of people and you can NEVER know what someone will do, especially on the internet. It probably won't happen again. If you really want to see something happening you should take all the stocks talked about here in some order and take some profits from each of them. Because I feel like the other stocks didn't squeeze, not even once. They look like some P&Ds. If you really wanted to squeeze again $GME, you would probably have to go with it again to 500$ and actually hold. But such a run up again doesn't seem feasible in my view. So the best thing now should be to focus on another one.      I am not a financial advisor, I am just a retard.     Positions: No position in any of these given stocks ($GME, $AMC, $BB, $NOK).
GENUINE DISCUSSION PLEASE!!! GME AMC ECT. ~CONTROVERSIAL~
So I have been making a bunch of memes and reposting other memes around all this and I'm getting alot of controversial opinions on what's real and what's not. What are your honest opinions. Personally I believe the hedgefunds definitely lost(past tense) alot, but I'm not sure if they still are or what's going on now, I'm new to stocks to begin with and this is wild. I'm not sure what to think anymore.  EDIT: PLEASE start a genuine conversation just because you disagree doesn't mean you have to hate, just share your opinion, maybe someone with a opposing opinion would like to hear yours.   I HAVEN'T EVEN BOUGHT STOCK!!! LIKE ANY STOCKS AT ALL! IDK WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT, I DIDNT SAY I DID JUST TRYING TO START A CONVERSATION TO UNDERSTAND THIS MASSIVE EVENT FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES YOU DONT HAVE TO MAKE COMMENTS LIKE AN ASSHOLE. JUST TALK!
Mods, can we please throw all the $GME $AMC, etc bullshit posts into a mega thread and move on
Titles says it all. Everyone that wants to cry about $GME and so forth can do so in a padded safe space away from the rest of WSB. Please cut the cancer and give these asshat bagholders a timeout so they can think on what they’ve done.
Broker weirdness.
I recently set up a Fidelity account and am waiting for information to process so my bank account is linked. I had no positions because well. No money.  I am currently waiting for RH to transfer stuff (they are expecting the 10th, but who knows, i was hoping to be able to shed more funds for some shares on fidelity.)  When i noticed the weirdest thing.   Out of no where i had a share show up for GME. And the account claimed it was negative 600 something.   Stranger still, it was on Margin.  I thought Margin bad, so i haven't bought one on Margin. But again, i haven't bought one period on fidelity yet there it was...  Well, now, the share and the account are gone / zero. Just like when this all started.  RH still has all my shares though... and i can't buy or sell them because my account is deactivated while the transfer is pending.   I seriously don't know what happened...   feels strangely like a Lab Ape, looks for her tinfoil hat

We could've replaced Starbucks on every corner with Gamestops
GME to 1k was a totally realistic projection.  Then people had a bunch of random carrot-on-stick options dangled in front of their faces to divide up the buying power of Retard Money (aka our weekly allowances from our guardians/caregivers)  Then Brokers restricted/stopped the ability to buy, and once you stop the momentum of a goldfish attention span zombie herd, they very soon go back to wondering about aimlessly.   Now everyone is all about doom n gloom loss porn. Getting anyone new in at this point is like trying to get someone interested in alcohol at an AA meeting. Yeah fuck that; Abe Simpson doing the walk in walk out 180 turn . gif.  Purely for the memes, I thought it would be comedic gold to see what a renovated Game Stop empire would look like post pandemic.   Stop in to GS on my way to work... Play Rock Band with some randoms... Get an Asian massage... Grab a bagel... throw some change into the lucky fountain...    "we built this..." I'd say to myself with a single tear as I headed out    When you have a vision, you gotta be able to stick with it through ups and downs or it's dead in the water.
What’s your play for next month
Enough of these diamond hand post, tired of whining little bitches crying about not getting rich over night. Welcome to WSB. We risk it for the biscuit. Raw dog strippers and snort blow we got off some random dude named Doug in the restroom.   What’s y’all’s play for next month ? I know we all got money to burn, I’m thinking about some good APHA calls $20. Haven’t gotten them yet but we’ll see if the price is right Monday opening. Got 2k to throw around, nah nevermind make it   (gotta get beer and blow), need some option opinions that’ll atleast bring 30-50% return in a month.   Also looking into some VZ $  calls expiring in April 16. Heard it from some random guy in this subreddit so it must be true 💀
Does this "Reporter" sound like Ken Griffin?
Listen to this podcast, and watch videos of Ken Griffin.     It sounds almost as though Ken Griffin wanted to get on a platform but sound like someone else "impartial".  They sound fucking identical, I thought it WAS a Ken Griffin interview at first until he started talking in 3rd person about himself(?)
Do you guys honestly feel like new people ruin everything? Are you so stuck up that you can't accept others and need to stand on your soapbox and complain that your precious sub is falling apart? Or is it that you just don't agree with something that is currently popular so you bitch and moan?
Christ people, this is a public site and you act like you own exclusive rights to it and everyone else should just go die. Just chill and learn to accept others. I can't imagine how you're making it through life with such piss poor attitudes.

Google it retards.
Yeah what do I know? I studied business.
First and foremost, I would like to say, you guys are an amazing group of degenerates. You accomplished what I only could theoretically dream of. Now with that said. We all want to stick it to the big man, and I believe that requires some inside knowledge of the big man. My next dream is that we have a spy or insider in the hedgefund where we compensate said person very well to know the Big man's movements and react to it.  I know it is a dream, but you guys make it possible, so I look forward to my next dream to come true.
I get my bags for life from aldi
Born yesterday
New here, new to trading. I’m sitting on what I would consider a reasonable amount of funds (for a beginner) in a locked in retirement savings account. Tired of it sitting there gathering dust. I believe I am able to invest said funds, but I don’t know even slightly how to do so. Any tips? Not looking for high risk, rather consistent growth.
I don't care about the money
So I have a unique outlook on GME and the whole meme stock situation. Unlike some people, I didn't throw my savings into GME or any of the other meme stocks. I put in a few hundred dollars when GME was at 30 and left it there. I'm in no scary financial situation, as a college student I have no mortgage, no giant financial obligations. I've always been an incredibly frugal person and I don't care about getting the huge payday that a lot of you guys are dreaming of.  But I want blood.  I'm sick of all of these Wall Street fuckers getting away with all of the shit they pull. I grew up getting shit on by many privileged assholes who didn't have to work for shit, so maybe I'm just a bitter person. Maybe I'm sick of feeling like all my hard work (Putting in ungodly study hours, doing extra work for ungrateful teachers just to boost my grade a fraction of a whole percent while these privileged fucks could cheat and lie their way through school) is for naught when these hedge fund bitches cry and whine for mommy government to take care of them and get everything handed to them on a silver platter. Or maybe it's just my optimism that makes me want to believe that a normal petson can make a change for this world. I want to help people. I want my life to mean more than than just being a grain of sand in an unfeeling world.  So Fuck Melvin, Fuck Citron, Fuck Wall Street, Fuck Robinhood, Fuck any other cowards that I'm forgetting and GME TO THE MOON  👏
AMC-Bad Day To Sell
Disclaimer idk anything about money I trade Pogs for Pokémon cards.  FINRA short reports are due 6pm eastern tonight, if you’ve held this long you might as well wait until this evening to find out if the emperor is wearing any clothes or not.  Or sell it at a 50% loss idk I’m not your dad, but I’m at least gonna hold long enough to find out if there is any fuel left in this rocket. If not I’m either gonna liquidate the loss or hold for a post-covid spike, not sure yet.  I am not a financial Doopity doop and this isn’t financial adoopity.
Hopium maybe ? Gme post in title so you can remove if needed
Things are looking down , real down. Today’s data dump will most likely be altered. The fine is small and the potential losses are great.  I’m doing some simple monkey math here with this post. Literally 3 bananas + 3 bananas type of shit so downvote me if you must.  First and foremost , I don’t believe for a second these suited apes covered any of their shorts made at 3 dollars. Was it   billion on the initial bet? Who knows anymore. The data here is so skewed I can’t even tell if we are in February , if aliens are real, or this is a simulation. Am I just an extra in Elon’s dream ?  Anyways if it was   billion at 3 dollars and melvin has half of their shit left which was what 15 billion?  They need the price under 15 to even cover. (Without counting price increase from covering )  Chances are they don’t expect to take a loss here , they want it back under 3. The biggest slap in the face is when they will get profit from this bet ANYWAYS.  Not selling , fuck my money and fuck melvin and fuck you. Requesting a paper certificate for my fucking shares to wipe my ass with . Diamond encrusted apes stay strong
Lost all my money because of this scam board and website
I put all my money and my family's money into GME last week because everywhere said invest GME and I didn't even know what reddit or WSB was.   Now the stock is almost completely worthless. I bought into the hype and now I have nothing. You keep saying hold, hold. I can't do that when I have bills, mortgages to pay.  You have all ruined my life and everything I have worked for. You all are scam artists and con artists

ALTRIA / MEDMEN (MMEN) / CRESCO LABS (CL) BUYOUY/Merger
Thought you retards should get in on this /r/weedstocks tip..   MO /   /    "Hear me out, and take this rumour with a grain of salt... though I do trust my friend and have known him for 10+ years. He works indirectly for Cronos (Altria), somewhere in logistics and shipping. He also doesn't know much about the industry but shares info because he knows I'm into it.  He says that heads over there have been in contact with "an American company called Cresco and Medmen" believe it or not, to Merge/acquire for their shipping/brick & mortar stores once USA laws loosen up.  No more info than that really but the way I look at it (very excitedly), is that This would be Altria's big US play as Cresco had the cultivation, multi state licenses, but most importantly the supply chain via their wholesale strategy, and MedMen has the brick & mortar locations plus licenses.  We all know the old JV Cronos has with MedMen (MMEN [CNSX exchange], (which my buddy had no clue about)  We also know that Cresco supplies mass wholesale west coast cannabis..  Could this leak be why we've seen MMEN shoot up the past week or so?  Disclaimer I've held MedMen bags for a couple years but always thought more would come of the Cronos JV."
Melvin and Co. Vs Retards
Extra Dumb Question about AMC
Ok, so yes, I know we're all shooting for a short squeeze, but on the other hand, Wanda (which owns 60% of AMC) has filed to be able to sell its shares, which, if it does, could lower the market further, and I'm seeing analysts with a target price of $2/share.  So here is my extremely dumb question: if the shares fall low enough and Wanda sells, could r/wallstreetbets theoretically buy a majority, and, operating as a voting block, start to install its own board members?  I know lots of people think theaters are dying, etc, and AMC isn't a good long long, but here is why I ask - I work in entertainment research. I know there are ways of restructuring the company and changing things for theaters that are actually really popular with moviegoers that theaters have been largely ignoring because old people (read: people in charge of actually making the decisions), don't get it, don't believe it, and are generally resistant to changing the business model. But it's real. The potential is there, the ship could still be turned.  Anyways, I know I'm probably retarded for asking this question, buuuuut, I also kind of see it as a way to turn around from a bagholder situation? It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it could maybe work to get the price back over $30?  Feel free to tell me why I'm stupid.  Position: bought $117 shares at $  - just getting started

Loss Porn with a story: What’s your biggest trading fuck-up?
You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. WSB traders are retarded. Most retail investors are pretty retarded. I’ve heard a statistic that 95% of new investors on RH lose money initially. Don’t quote me on that, or anything, I’m retarded. Some retards do make money though. Most are lucky. But some learn from their mistakes, become a little less retarded, and make at least enough to buy a McDouble for their wife and her boyfriend, which is nice. So in the vein of learning from our mistakes, let’s hear your biggest loss porn horror stories and, if anything, what you learned from the experience.
we are not selling
i know we aren't selling and we just love this stonk because stonks only go up, however since we have the attention of the suits, which other stonks can we take to the moon with us? we could use some weed up there you know,   this is not financial advice. i am just trying to figure out the next move. diamond hands

What I did not like about Gamestop as a customer
The value proposition with selling and buying used games was not there for me.  It always felt lopsided.  Gamestop will pay you let’s say $3 dollars for a game, then turn around and sell it for $30.  You could argue that Gamestop’s cost of managing inventory justifies the markup.  This did not change anything for me as a customer.  I turned to eBay instead.  I felt I got a truer market value with my exchanges.  Now even though I always bought and never sold on eBay a seller gets the most profits, not eBay.  An individual seller benefiting the most.  Power to the players Gamestop, don’t forget!  Hopefully the buyer got a truer market value as well instead of a set price that probably doesn’t sell until it goes on sale or worse clearance.  Potentially wasting resources required by Gamestop to manage the inventory and floor space.  If Gamestop could eliminate this obstacle, now that I’m diamond FUCKING hands, I could see myself using Gamestop for my used video game exchanges.  Even selling this time.  I could see how Gamestop could use it’s store fronts and name recognition (ape t-shirts anyone??) to leverage itself as the premier destination for the used gaming market to even rival eBay.  Well it fucking better or I’m never getting my tendies.  Now onto the stuff I absolutely loved about Gamestop as a customer.  Midnight motherfucking launches.  Battlefield 3, Destiny, The Order 1886.  I think it was just those three but I had a blast.  You can argue it’s all digital now so the days of actually having to go to the store is done but at the moment, the used market is limited to physical.  Some folks also just prefer physical media.  I know I feel this way about books.  And that’s it unfortunately.  I still love gaming, since the Atari 2600.  I just now purchase digitally so I don’t have to worry about the literal baggage but I think physical media will always have a place.  I still have my N64 and Dreamcast.  Maybe if the conditions are right, I’d even let go of my beloved Dreamcast collection in very good used condition with four controllers fishing rod arcade stick and two official light guns.  Gamestop DM me if you’re serious about paying me market value for them!  Sike, I’m holding.
Trying to sell GME/AMC
Im trying to sell but my phone cant understand the imprint of my diamond hands!!! Hodl mfers
Any one else notice all the angry bots have letters and numbers for their names like license plates.
Every time I find obvious shill bots being obvious they have names like O7NA1 or 93F2J or similar.
It ain't over till it's over, and it ain't over yet (motivation)
MSM wants us to think that this is over. Belfort went on with Cavuto saying shit like "the little guy lost". Who the fuck is he? They dare to tell us what we know, or say, or do, or where we stand in this fight? They don't know shit! That's why they wear that little monitor in their ear. This is far from over! Cuban and Musk can go fuck themselves for chasing clout, talking a big game and showing hollow support for us AND YET HOLD NOTHING IN SHORTED STOCKS! No GME, AMC, fucking NOTHING!!! They're hypocrites riding the bandwagon for free, thinking they can speak on our behalf without putting skin in the game! They're worse than paper hands. They're EMPTY HANDS! We shouldn't be standing for this shit!   No. This is far from over. WSB doesn't just eat, sleep, shit, and fuck like cuck sheep! We are diamond-handed, retarded apes! WE LIKE THE STOCK! WE HOLD THE LINE!!!  Monday is fast approaching, brothers and sisters. A brand new week! The continuation of the saga. This saga must not end until every hedge manager, news anchor, and fi-tech brokerage CEO has bled enough green that they're either hanging from the office rafters, flat as a fried egg on the pavement, or dropping soap with Jerry Sandusky!   If it weren't for WSB, GME would be gone, and the vultures would have picked off their dirty profits to the bone. But WSB gave GME a second chance, a second wind, an opportunity for redemption. They're getting new execs and reports indicate that they're looking to steer the company in an improved direction. When they announce their plans for the future publicly, watch GME rocket into intergalactic space! And look at AMC. They're reopening their doors! If Alamo Drafthouse can keep it's doors open, then other theaters can too!   AUTISTS ASSEMBLE!!!
fuck the capital

I can't access my IBKR through their phone app to go all in with my savings YOLO STYLE. It's not like they're restricting trading in a single stock! Lol.
To all the new subs coming to WSB thinking this place will get you rich cause of GME...
WSB is full of retards, proudly so, and if you actually want to make money you probably wanna do the exact opposite of whatever the majority of the sub is doing. Been that way for long time. Not changing cause the news told you WSB manipulate stocks   This is not sub where you take advice and make smart plays. WE ARE NOT FINANCIAL ADVISORS.  This is a sub about yoloing, memes, and gain/loss porn. Get with it or learn the hard and expensive way (and probably just have). Its just that WE LOVE THESE STONKS! STONKZ ONLY GO UP!!
Are the shorts covering slowly in multiple small bursts??
Just look at   from yesterday. At 11:00 and 16:30 the price  and  volume suddenly spiked   a lot  . Is this proof that the shorts are still up and being covered slowly and steadily in multiple small bursts rather than one huge spike?

A hard lesson is about to be learned in GME.
Dear Penis Flys of WSB,   You so generously bought a crap ton of GME shares that most likely were being held by a handful of individuals hoping things would turn around for GME. Well fundamentals alone said run long ago but here me out, (I’ve been a successful full time futures trader for years) now that you have given the pre circus “hodlers” a nice pool of liquidity to sell into, its GME, set, match for this stock. Are you going to leave that capital you borrowed from your relatives, tied up in this bag forever? I didn’t think so. One bankruptcy headline about the company and it’s going to be a violent dash to unload your likely, already realized autistic mistake. I couldn’t be more excited and proud of you guys. You are finally destroying yourself financially like you always promised you would here in this sub.   Thanks for the memories and be sure to show off your shiny red P/l’s, proving yourself to the world that you are in fact full blown disabled. God be with you gents👀
Money doesn't care which stock it recovers on! If you are burnt on $GME, the dollars don't have to be recovered on the same ticker.
With many of you bag holding GME hoping for a price increase to recoup losses (which may or maynot happen), it is important to remember that your Benjamins don't care which ticker it recovers on.  If you want to hold your positions on GME on principle, then that's all good. But for others, you should remmeber that you can recoup loses on other tickers.. We are in a bull market, and many many many tickers are posting 10% gains each day. Find one that you like and invest in them, and potentially in a couple of months you'd have recovered your losses.
Just write calls gdi this thing is a CASH COW.   ?   💼.
If one monke were to hold 100 shares of anything let’s say a game stock that dumb fucking monke doesn’t have to sell anything to make money off it for a good long while.   Look at the high and low on those calls anywhere down the chain. Even like wayyy otm. That difference can be yours. Is it betraying the bull? Nah, it’s just being smart. And it’s a better alternative to just dropping bags of diamonds cuz your hands are made of paper. You wanna be a purist? I applaud you your hands of diamond. But those of you a little nervous? The bags feeling heavy? Relieve your load dummy, pull a diamond out. Grind those bags lighter, piece by piece, covered call by covered call. You can go all night. We can go every expiration (roll that tide). This could very well just be a war of attrition. A siege lasting many MOONS and many barrages of TANKS. But a siege can last when there’s smugglers and profiteers on your side. The little gangs of the ta kers slowly accumulating raw material to be ready for the final counter.   Just read this stupid. It’s fucking easy. And maybe finally some of you can stfu about holding bags of diamonds with paper soft hands and you can grow as human beings and investors and add some wrinkles to your baby smooth brains.   Also this is obviously not fucking financial advice and I’m not a fucking financial anything I linked an investopedia article I only read like a quarter of and even then only intermittently while watching porn.
Bought at top lol. Gonna hold the poop hands to the end for a diamond scooping hands.
Still HODLING with you lads till the end.    🤚🤚🤚 not much but its what I can do to pay my respects
At this point, yall are pathetic.
Party's over. Most people still here are bag holders who have convinced each other that 'sticking it to the man' was worth losing 6k of their 45k net worth.  Or worse, they think it's still "going to the moon" and that Melvin will be forced to buy your 54 shares at 10k each. Keep dreaming buddy, keep dreaming all the way to $12/share.   At this point you might as well hold on to GME shares and hope Gamestop's core business actually recovers so your shares go up to $17 in 3 years from now.  Honestly I just hope whatever money you're down, or however much time you wasted to make basically nothing, was worth the fun. I'm not saying it wasn't fun.
Palantir is flying again

GME option to cover
I’d like create a loss free situation to bring GME to the moon. So to avoid squeezing attach from next hedge pirates, we can buy some long term put options, anybody know any liquid one? Thanks
Is this sub even wsb
What the actual fuck has happened to all the yolo calls and puts and why are meme stocks everywhere? I mean props to DFV and I hope the investigations find nothing of... Value... But still like this sub used to be fun to read for some retard dd and crazy gain/loss and now irs just memes. In the words of the almost dictator of us... "Sad!" Thanks for not recruiting him i guess?
What does 120% of float shorted mean?
GME is still 120% shorted, I thought that means the squeeze can still come. Am I wrong?
Story time
The year is 3069  The 1% is primarily made up of the descendants of the shareholders of Gamestop before the stock went parabolic for the fifteenth time.   After it was clear no one was selling, the share price hit $24,000 in 2021. Then continued on a divine ascent for the next 2 years, topping   billion a share.   Still the share holders did not sell.   It was at this time, GameStop decided to do something incredible. They released a 10,000 share offering. The shorts being forced to buy back in now that stocks were available instantly made GameStop the most valuable company in the world by millions of times any other competitor. GameStop then immediately bought every business in the world and announced a 1% quarterly dividend.   Within 10 years all holders of GameStop shares would be wealthy enough to replace not only their hands with diamonds, but also every member of their family’s as well.   Overall not much changed beyond this. You could still eat at a GameStop Subway or a GameStop Jersey Mike’s. You could even find some GameStop Quiznos still around, as no company could ever go bankrupt again.   Melvin and his cronies died as feudal slaves, as insufficient funds left only their weak paper hands and rigid brains as repayment.
It’s not much but it’s an honest living  🏽‍♂️ 📈☝🏽. Also down 3k due to a recent AMC investment...

AMC gang wya?  has everyone forgotten about AMC ? why was it just pushed under the radar and no one talks about it anymore? I’m prepared to sit on my investment for a long time in hopes that it pays off, but does anyone have any trajectory for the timeline on when (if at all) it will take place? only media i’ve seen the past few days is people selling at a loss with AMC. I invested over a grand at just under $14/share and i’m down 61%, would love some other autist insight.
GME Emergency Shareholder Meeting >> Link
If we make it happen, hedge funds  will have to close the short positions that they have lended to each other therefore activate the squeeze.         Edit : From reading the comments, it seems like e-mailing GME is a better way, but this helps as well.         Note   : Pls, ffs, if people want to hold, stfu, if people wanna paper hand and sell, stfu.    It's none of my or your business  , I personally, from the objective data and metrics that have seen do not think the squeeze hasn't happened and the short haven't covered, by looking at the floating and shorts data ( i'm a retard btw and have no idea what I'm talking about ).  WSB has been about gambling, if you want investing advice, I'd kindly like to offer you r/investing because this sub is of a wide range of people - from people that yolo their houses to people that take profit. Let's not judge each other and enjoy the ride. If you want to be a part of history, cool; if you wanna say "lmao conspiracy theorists you shouldve sold hahahah", cool. Idgaf.  Not financial advice.
Y'all need to let GME happen
I've been on reddit for 8 (9?) years, and I've seen hype waves come and go, and sometimes these waves of hype influence important changes in the world, economy, and quality of life for some people. GME will be prevalent for awhile, because this is an ongoing battle. We have to let this happen.  I'm holding and buying as I can. And I hope you will be patient and let this economic revolution continue. This could change they way we invest in the future as we discover more about wall st's dirty plays. If anything, the insight we get by fighting back is some of the most valuable DD we can get.  God speed, retards. To Valhalla!
$CGC - A goliath on their last legs.
Hello all,  I will keep this post really simple. Canopy is a weed company in Canada that has lost money for the past 2 years after being semi-acquired by their parent company Constellation Brands.   Canopy is worth 17 billion dollars despite never producing a profit.    Canopy has burned 1 billion dollars of direct cash burn over the past year and invested roughly another 1 billion in United States and Canadian businesses. These investments have amount to   goodwill and a horrible cash position at 673m.        Canopy reported earnings today and stated that they have   in cash and cash equivalents, a loss of .39 billion (hilarious wording or $390 million) at the end of the quarter today. They have not uploaded their current balance sheet to SEDAR.  So they either have less investments or spent another 170 million in direct cash. Putting us at around 500 million in direct cash.  Hidden in today's earnings/press release -   As additional consideration for the assets being transferred and the termination of the royalty agreement, Canopy Growth will make a cash payment to CRC of $115 million and issue an aggregate of 3,750,000 commons shares to CRC.   Canopy will need to spend another 115 million and dilute shareholders to divest from another horrible Canadian business they acquired back in 2018 or whatever. This will hit the books next Q as Canopy Rivers has to vote/agree to that consolidation of capital.  From there, we have $500 million - $115 from this settlement = $375 million in direct cash after this transaction set up for next quarter, and projected cash burn from operations at another $100 million.   To be fair, the CEO has been cutting costs and it is all over the press releases about their efforts.    Either way, they are at to be fair $275 million in direct cash and   billion in investments going into next quarter.   They are going to have to raise capital.    \ -  Topic change, well Canopy is in a growth sector. Sales must be booming in Canada, with a population of 35 million people! Yea well, they were. In November, it actually started to decline.        \   Okay, so what about Constellation helping out Canopy. Well If you look at the actual agreement, Constellation extended the payment tranche out to November 2023. So they hold the option to deliver 5 billion dollars to Canopy by November 2023. That's amazing flexibility for Canopy, right?! Yea you would think so, but the reason it was extended is directly related to Constellation's balance sheet right now.  Constellation's last Q:        Now, no one is doubting Constellation's ability to raise cash. They have immense liquidity, but if you actually look at their balance sheet. They have 10 billion in debt. They can either provide shares to Canopy and royally fuck over current STZ shareholders, or take on debt to provide it.   The deal is going to get restructured.   They will never provide 5 BILLION dollars to a company that can turn a profit.  Options Chain:        There's my position. I am all in bitches. Weed cannot go up forever. The company is worth 17 billion dollars. STZ is not going to provide 5 billion dollars to a company that already accumulated   billion in goodwill, will need more cash to fund US legalization, and cannot even turn a profit.  Let the puts fly.     Edit - There is something really weird happening with the 2/19 40P. It has over 41,000 contracts traded in the past 3 hours. It's incredibly irregular.

Dynatrace the magic cloud genie
Dynatrace, DT, has some serious tech. They are applying Artificial Intelligence to cloud management.   Think of all that it takes to run thousands of servers in the cloud.. the infrastructure is enormously complicated and there are tens of thousands of servers constantly switching tasks based on demand. Tech has developed cloud deployment and management tools like Kubernetes running Docker and the like. This field is called DevOps and it’s the playground of DevOps engineers.   Now what if you want to automate as much as possible these incredibly complicated systems? How do you monitor diagnose and alert based on problems you may not even know exist? Can you build automated repair and optimization systems that go beyond the basic building block implementation?   Enter Dynatrace, which is solving these problems with AI. They have AI anomaly detection, AI automated cloud management, and AI driven optimization.    The potential for AI in the space is incredible and Dynatrace has only begun to capture market share. They are lightyears ahead of traditional DevOps tooling.   They recently had a great quarterly report and have broken out of their trading range. A host of analysts have upgraded in recent earnings. As the market realizes their potential I believe there is massive upside especially in this tech bubble.   I intend to initiate a position on Monday of long calls with March expiry:  DT 03/19 60c   And potentially some long call Leaps.
Thank You GME for punching my ticket to the Millionaire's Club!

I miss going to the Movies, and so do you. Which is why we’re not selling
Like everyone else in this sub I’m sick of covid. Sick of this pandemic and having to be inside. I know that it could take a minute for things to get back to normal but we’re on our way. And one thing I am doing when this is all over, is going to the movies. The movies have been around for years on years and aren’t going away anytime soon.  So regardless if this squeeze happens, and I’m not saying it won’t. Whoever says “it’s over” or “it’s happening on this day” has no idea what they’re talking about. AMC is a very good stock for the long haul.   The only reason you should be selling now is if you absolutely need the money. If you don’t need it then hold and watch what happens. Without a doubt I think AMC will go 20+ by 2022.
Didn’t make it to $100k but at least I didn’t hold it to the bottom like you smooth brains
MAGNITE (MGNI)
What is $MGNI?  Magnite, Inc. operates an independent sell-side advertising platform in the United States and internationally. Its omnichannel advertising platform enables publishers to monetize various auction types and formats, including CTV, desktop display, video, audio, and mobile, as well as allows agencies and brands to access brand-safe ad inventory and execute advertising transactions. Magnite is also acquiring SpotX which now makes them the largest most profitable stock in this small but ever growing industry. Magnite and SpotX will count among their high-profile customers Disney's Hulu, Roku, Discovery, fuboTV, and Electronic Arts, among many others.  This play is a somewhat long hold. I’d say a year but could be less. A price target I have in mind is $100 before November 2021. I have full faith in this company and honestly think one of the ARK’S will invest a lot into this company once it really starts running.  Positions- 44 shares. i made a lot of flips on calls, but I’m a broke boy and can’t afford much of anything so I decided to INVEST in this for the time being.      rockets to catch the retards attention  TL:DR: read my text you ape (this is not financial/investment advice) also this is my first DD

My thoughts on firearms and ammunition companies as an investment strategy
Good morning assholes.      I see a lot of people in firearms-adjacent jobs and lifestyles talking up buying stock in gun and ammo manufacturing. I'm not, because I think it's a trap. And not because of any apocalyptic predictions, either. Hear me out.      Manufacturing both firearms and ammunition requires a substantial investment to set up for, in terms of time and capital. Additionally, these companies can't get support in the form of loans from \ most\  banks because of being reclassified recently as "high risk" for money laundering. I don't agree with this, but what's right and what is real don't always intersect perfectly.      Because of the temporary nature of the surge in demand, I believe that companies such as Fiocchi and one or two others which have recently added production floor space, \ only\  did so because they were already planning to do so for some time now. So far as I know, there have been no reactive expansions of production as a result of 2020's state of non-stop panic.      Because after the hype settles down, ultimately, demand will eventually return to normal, most likely way too early for any expansion in production capabilities to lead to an increase in market share or saturation.      A FEW POINTS AND COUNTERPOINTS:   1. 2020 saw an unprecedented number of new gun owners. Won't that cause an increased long-term demand for ammunition?   \-Probably not. My feel for the climate right now is that most of those firearms will end up rotting in a safe or getting resold secondhand for cheap and no longer contributing to a consistent demand. This surge in new owners is likely a major contributing factor to the current shortage. Once they all have the requisite one or two boxes that their gun-owner friend recommended they grab, that's probably it for them. That's still MILLIONS of boxes of ammunition, but unlikely to contribute anything in terms of long-term repeating purchases for the majority of new owners.    2. What if new legislation is enacted?   \-Then manufacturers will probably pivot toward compliant manufacturing and designs, much like what happened during the last AWB. Demand will surge for a short period and then drop slightly. Puts or shorts may be a better option than stocks or calls if you expect this to happen.   3. What if nothing happens and things go back to normal?    \-Then the price of stock should do about the same.      TL;DR -      Just because demand appears huge now doesn't necessarily mean there's much in the way of money to be made. A lot of the apparent surge in demand comes from a number of factors that make things look way worse than they really are, and none of these things is likely to last past the next year or two.     I think buying an actual M1 Garand might be a better investment strategy, seeing as how they never actually seem to get any cheaper.
The More You Average Down, The Easier It Becomes For Your Stocks Reach Escape Velocity
Is it Time to be more Bullish on Recoveries?
With the senate voting, with Harris’s tie breaking vote, to move forward with the   trillion Covid relief bill ( The bill hasn’t  actually passed yet but most certainly will within the next few weeks) is it time to call/buy airlines, cruise lines, and other stocks hit hard by the pandemic again after they’ve stagnated for a while??? Is this bill the boost they need to finally come up by double digit % or is the hype around it far too great already?   (This isn’t political I just wanna hear your thoughts on how the bill will affect the market)
What a great year, thanks WSB for making these insane gainz possible! From 40k to 300k. Been moving my money over to Fidelity, still got GME in Robinhood for now.
Aim for the moon
We are not your friends.
We are not your friends, People who tell you to buy or sell are not doing it because they want you to make money. They are doing it because they want to make money off you. I shorted GME so if i tell people to sell it is because i want to make money. I do not care about whether or not you make millions or lose everything. But ask yourself why people are telling you to buy? They dont know you and they do not care if you make or lose money. They are telling you to buy because they want to make money off you.  If you want to buy or sell GME that is fine, but if you buy or sell GME because someone on Reddit told you to. You are a fool and you are allowing people to make money off you.   TLDR: Think for yourself, Because if you let people think for you. They will take advantage of you.
To All The Og's Who Hate The Way This Subreddit Has Become
Your subreddit is DEAD, and you wont make these monkey retards leave no matter what, so you might as well not bother trying  The same way GME has lost all its value, so has your dear community, and i hate to break it to ya, but this sub is INFECTED  It is indeed unfair how life treats us, but it is what it is, and you have no more power than the GME monkey squad. So, you should probably look into creating a new sub, instead of trying to remove all these people, that you have 0 power over :)
When does the whole monetary Ponzi scheme come crashing down?
As we all probably know the USD was taken off the gold standard in 1971. As we're the currencies of many other countries since that time.  Central banks have just been printing more fiat currency since then. Using debt to pay down debt, and needing more debt each time to pay off previous debt. It's a giant Ponzi scheme.  This is devaluing the money at an astonishing rate, nothing is really getting more expensive, it's just our money and wages are continually being devalued.  But all fiat currency goes to zero value at some point. As it always has throughout history.  I think the hyperinflationary debt crisis is coming soon. Just like Weimar republic Germany where they needed a "wheelbarrow" full of money to buy a loaf of bread.  Fake money can't go on forever.  And this time its global, because the world reserve currency is the USD which is backed by nothing.  China and Russia probably know this and that's why they're buying and hoarding gold.  Im sure this is what the whole "great reset" is that the world economic forum keeps talking about. Surely anyone who understands a few basic fundamentals about money and history would know this whole Ponzi scheme is going to blow up at some point.
My perspective on $GME
First of all, I know a lot of you will think I'm a bot or a shill because I dare to express an opinion that's not 100% in line with everything you've bought into. I don't really know what to do about that, but I'm clearly not a bot and if you can think of a way for me to prove I'm not a shill, I'm all ears.  Second, as some of you know because you've complained about it every time I do it, I've been posting a help message into the big threads on this subreddit, telling people that they can reach out and that they're not alone. I've received messages from over 500 people in the last 4 days, and they're all just happy to have someone to talk to, and to listen to them. Some of them only have a share or two of GME or a few dozen AMC, and some people bought in for over $100,000.   Almost all of them are selling, or have already sold, and absolutely none of them are buying more. I would estimate, conservatively, that 4 out of 5 people who message me have already sold, and half of the ones who haven't tell me that they're going to ASAP. All of them find me from my posts on this subreddit, which is the most bullish place for GME that exists on the internet, and they're   still   all selling. Please, please, just sort by new on some of these threads, or on the subreddit's front page. Sort by new and read through the posts, and recognize that the sentiment you're seeing on the big posts on here does not reflect the majority, or reality.  Make your own decisions and do what's best for you, but please, understand that nobody is still in this. You are buying into a lie that is being pushed by people who are either trying to make money off of you or don't know any better and NEED to believe that this is going to come back up.  That's all. Do with that what you will. And please, feel free to reach out if you're feeling upset or scared. I'm always happy to listen.
Dealing with discouragement
You know, you guys, I know I am not the only one feeling this way.  I really thought I was going to go to the moon last week! But... obviously, we aren't there (yet??).  Nonetheless, it really had me depressed.    I found a way that is helping me to deal with it, and maybe it can help some others.  I have decided that I am going to hold, not because diamond hands or whatever, but because I have decided that it isnt too late to start over.     The money I put into my meme stocks, I am just going ti consider a total loss, and if it goes up at all, GREAT!!! If not, ok, I already consider it a loss.  In the mean time I have learned some valuable lessons and I learned a ton about the stock market, corruption, news/media and how it is controlled, and emotional investing.  This was a great experience and I am better because of it.    My plan, at this point, is to hold what I have and diversify from here on out.  This isn't financial advice at all, but I do hope that it helps someone with any feelings of depression/anxiety.  If you can't afford to hold or you need bills paid, sell at a loss, it isn't admiting defeat, it is taking care of yourself.  Do what you have to do.  Mods, other people that think this is a stupid post, say what you want, but I suffer from depression and anxiety and I really believe that someone may need to hear this, so I ask you don't take it down or add mean/pessimistic comments....  Thanks for reading.  Tldr: if you are feeling depressed or hopeless about the past week or two, try to find at least one thing out of all of this that you have learned and how you are better off now because you know more now than you did then.  Move forward, and do what you have to do to take care of yourself and your family.
Short ladder attack demo
Can someone explain how it went to 17$ twice and dropped back down?
The truth that has been overlooked by many.
Anyone who thinks retail was behind the massive squeeze on GME and the other 10-15 stocks with high short interest in the same week is foolish! We don’t have that much buying power!   Hedge funds attacked other hedge funds and did it under the smokescreen of retail investors!  The success of this hedge fund attack masked through wallstreetbets should be worrisome to us. They were so successful at this attack that they will keep trying to USE us to make more tendies that will leave a lot of us holding the bag!   This wasn’t an attack against the system. This was a billionaire sector using us to attack another billionaire sector. Now how many of you are holding a bag because of it? And the amount of gme posts still being posted is sad, because it shows that a large group of you don’t understand this and are and will continue to be the victim!   Anyone who trades with a political agenda, with anger, with spite, or as an offensive attack on another group will be left holding the bag!  Trading isn’t about trying to defeat a system. It’s not even about trying to defeat the stock market. The stock market will do what it does, it can’t be defeated, it doesn’t have emotional attachments to wins or losses.  It isn’t for or against any individual or group. It only does what it does and a great trader understands this and trades according to this standard. The only enemy in trading is yourself.  Ride the wave don’t fight the wave. This is the way.
A case for ARGGY
Ok so I'm new here and I've only started messing with the market about a year ago, but I want to make a case for a stock I think has a lot of growth in the future, ARGGY, or Aston Martin.  So far I have just been looking for companies that are down because of the rona and banking on their recovery.  I work in the auto industry so I have been investing what I know, which is automakers.  Ford has been good, I'm up like 80%, but ARGGY is up 130% and I think it is only getting started. They have the DBX suv coming out, which I think will be a big money maker once they can get the production line started which will help. They are getting back into F1 which could help their price depending on how they do.  They have brought on some big names from Mercedes-AMG to help run things. Short version: I think this one is going to go up quite a bit in the next year or so. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
Question about deciphering information
Hey y’all, I’m curious as to find out how to decipher and learn as much  as I can about trading. I’m looking at level2 info in Webull I have a couple sites pulled up explaining what things actually mean. I understand some of it but I would like a deeper understanding. Could you find it in your hearts to share web pages and other places you have gathered your information about what everything means and what trends to look at and different things. Does not have to be specific to one stock, I’m more curious in the entire oversight of the apps and what the level 2 information, how shorts work and that type of stuff
WSB veterans, thanks for being retarded
Alright,  I'm not new to this sub, but I don't really post either. I always lurk and talk shit. But, I did learn ("learn" lmfao) investing from the dumb shit you guys post. I saw somewhere on reddit that you guys are getting bummed out by the $GME cult on here. So, I just want to thank the OG WSB retards, I made some money on this subs advice, but I lost about half as much to.  So thanks for being retarded, and giving me the courage (courage?) to try amateur investing. Mostly because I figure I can't do it worse than these guys.  Anyway, fuck owning stocks, puts an calls 4ever.  EDIT: PRovE IT! ;)  The fuck do I post pictures on this shit? $BB going places btw.

My First-Ever Stock Purchase - AMC
I'm over 50 years old and made my first-ever stock purchase of AMC a bit late in the rally when it was selling at over $   I'm not what anyone would call a wealthy man, but I have a slush fund that I can use with discretion.  AMC closed 2/6/2021 at $   I'm not a hero trying to flash my diamond hands here, but I am going to hold AMC because I believe in it.  The time will come when it will repurpose itself to serve a broader audience and, consequently, it will begin to make money again.  I believe this in my soul.  It may take months.  It make take years.  Yet, it will return to its former glory.  Similarly, you  May have this same gut feeling -  "Hold the line," you say.   Many of us will  Continue to hold the line:  AMC will rise!             We have waited around for a while  In a truly remarkable trial,  Yet, the value will rise!  To the moon? Just the skies?  It won't matter: we've held out in style.

Can we get back to posting about other stocks yet?
I get it, GME mania took over, you're holding until X happens.. cool. You keep doing you. For the rest of us, can we get back to talking about other stocks? I like Oil plays.. a LOT. I am loaded up in call options for March on OXY, APA, HP, NOV, PBF, PBR, MMP. Pretty much the entire oil space is moving higher together. Pick your Fav company. Many have broadening patterns that are just getting through their middles and should start accelerating. I think its flying under the radar because things like GME/AMC and Growth Stocks just dominate the conversation.  Edit on EOD 2/8: And the account goes Boom Shaka Laka ! More to come this week.. Stick with Energy. Its not just for Grandma traders any more.
You people need to understand that we like the stock, it’s that simple.
Seeing some posts putting WSB down recently and how we are not waging war on hedge funds or whatever. The fact is we like GME stock. Many people like GME stock and many people were hurt in 2008 by the fat cats. So who cares if some hedge funds made or lost money, maybe some are still bleeding money due to shorting millions of shares. Also if you came here for investing advice then you’re an ape who is probably in the right place.

Poem About Stock Debacle: False Hierarchy
\[poem\]  Manage your hedge fund, with your yes men. Take your allowance from Daddy, and invest in. Take the ethics of business, shame and molest them. Contribute to inequality, harm the people, stress them.  More effective than an RH shutdown. When the corrupt mods got washed out & drowned, all the decent Redditors congregated, gathered around. Some sacrificed their presence here: martyrs vs. entitled clowns. Ironic sub, for selflessness, to take the c 's crown, at the end of the war, when the cavalry came to town.  Hope you enjoy your movie deals, and ego-driven feels. Credit with others as a human just rotted, and congealed. Your last bet is having enough cash to cover your back-stabbing ass, for real. How long did you think your conspiracy would remain concealed? The fat lady didn't just sing for you, she squealed.  This is a good day. I have to grin, and nod. All the effort, and intelligence, that countered these self-absorbed mods... I've learned more about stocks, which were confusing, and odd, on here for 30 minutes than a class back in Aug...  I'm not here as a subscriber to get rich. I'm here because this sub has integrity, and grit. People like that? I'd like to align myself with. Learn from, and honor, while we all co-exist.  I'm a penniless artist, and this is my art. The toxicity you guys beat has moved my entire heart. The poor aren't stupid. They're resourceful, and smart. That's why Wall Street had to take back their shopping cart. We damn-near walked away with it. We went THAT hard...  CEO's aren't impressive to me. One Redditor helped this sub exist, for FREE. Blew the whistle, when the vultures returned, to feed. Their return to this sub, something we need!  So to anyone   anyone who had the decency to make sure this problem was solved: This world can be awful, and some think it   their egos, colossal, even though they lack balls, backbone, or competence. Quivering lips on their jaws. Subscribed this sub, because it proved to the WORLD, that Wall Street: It's flawed.  The   and wealthy, so shocked, in awe. Here's a salute to you all! May their hierarchy fall...  PS: To any affiliated with those bums. Enjoy criticizing others, and twiddling your thumbs. Your ringleaders just got clapped, and karma has come. You're all just their followers. Fake. Spineless. SCUM.
DD - Back to Business
Last week companies like PLTR are back up and trending in the right direction. (I do hold PLTR) I think the EV stocks are about to do the same again as this other sideshow levels out.  Company - Quantumscape - QS    Product - a lighter, more efficient battery for EV's. Charges faster than a Tesla battery. Protected with Patents so this is not common technology. Gets about 85% charge in 15 mins which is amazing.  Virtually No Debt. The biggest liability on their last Nov Balance sheet was deferred underwriting expenses.   Volkswagen owns 20% of the company so there is a big potential customer with skin in the game and who can offer vehicle manufacturer feedback and input. They paid $300M for this so its not a gimme to get a good partner. One of their Execs sits in the board.  Bill Gates is also an investor - like him or hate him dude is smart.  After the big GM and Ford announcements this EV thing is real now. Its not just a Tesla thing or the odd product out of the majors. Big money is being put towards product development. This could be an argument for jus going to buy Tesla but its an expensive stock and has the good already priced in. So trying to find others is the challenge. These guys don't have the issues a manufacturer of cars does. Battery technology will have uses outside of vehicles. So that's why I like this component.  Quantumscapes battery is not a full Lithium battery. They are solid state Lithium. Lithium isn't great for the environment but it is the future of batteries so smaller and more efficient is a bonus.  Downside: this is not in major production right now. Its a great technology but is not actively in vehicles. Read: No sales.  The recent sell off was probably due to over excitement and the insiders sold shares after the lock up. However the remaining 95% of insider and employee shares are locked up.  This is not likely a moon shot tomorrow as these things take a while to fully develop but the SPAC gave them a piss pot of cash for R&D.  Next earnings release is Feb 16. If you are feeling good, you can get in before then. If you want to be conservative, wait until this is public. I don't expect there to be any sales. This will be an update on the battery technology and if they have taken on any debt. The last release was a $  loss per share. This is not an all in share and should only be considered if you have some spec space in your account.   Do your own homework. Check out the company's web page, read some articles. See if the difference in the solid state battery technology versus Lithium Ion makes sense. Forbes has a negative article on the company but its all based on valuation from companies who are not emerging.   My brokerage firm shows   short interest. I will look at that as positive for the direction and not a positive in anticipation of a squeeze.  Not a financial advisor. Just someone who enjoys Tendies and likes doing homework.

We gonna let them talk about us like this?
A GME story.
No one is trying to make you sell your GME.
You cultish followers of GME think we are trying to get you to sell.  We do not care if you sell.  It is just as fun to make fun of you if you hold or sell now.  It might be even funnier next week when the price is even lower.  We just want you to shut the fuck up with the spam.  No one here cares about your 3 fucking shares.  No one cares about your emoji spam.  Apes?  No one cares.  Some of you seem to want to learn something.  This might be a bad place for that.  Most of you seem to think you uncovered some great cabal run by hedge funds (by the way, no one fucking abbreviates hedge funds to HF), but you are just larping.  No one is working to thwart you.  You are far too unimportant for any of the big players to notice.  Apes together are still fucking apes.
CINE the English AMC I like this stock
You retards got me into stonks quicker then my wife's boyfriend got into me. So yup I'm a GME baby (still holding but gotta admit I sold at 420 and then bought in the dip so I could start playing with some house money).  Being from the UK I thought I'd give a UK stock some love, Cineworld being one of the UK cinemas that I recon will be in for a post covid boom. Plus I like Cineworld so I like this stock. I can't post the chart as I'm too noob to be allowed images but it looks alright and is already up from when I bought it.  Still holding my GME and gonna hold CINE until my wifes boyfriends cousin tells me to stop
I'm biased bc of avg cost, but still holding. Secured 100k in profit to pay all my debt off. Had to ride huge waves to even get to that point. Securing profits makes holding so much easier. Wake me up from cryosleep once we hit Andromeda.
I may be bleeding, but yesterday I found one gauze. Stay Strong.
What stocks and sectors do you expect to see growth in 2021 & 2022?

Best Buy $BBY DD. Earnings play.
TLDR: BBY Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (2/19, 2/26, 3/19 115-120cs or a strike near their all time high of 123) and Shares  This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it:  Overall: Everyone and their mom buys electronics at Best Buy.  This has accelerated to extremes over the last quarter, positioning BBY for a huge earnings blowout on 2/25.  It is a direct beneficiary of stimulus checks, and was upgraded by Bank of America with a 132, YES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO, price target just two days ago.  BBY is 10$ under it's all time high and starting to moon.  Check the chart, retard.  Upside:  BBY has cash on hand, $  to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $  to $  See? What did I say?)  They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense.  They surprised with an EPS of $  last quarter vs $  expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID.  Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand. That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site.  They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then.  Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3. Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below.  Downsides:  Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, CEO Corie Barry is a traditional "okay" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them. So let's recap so far:  An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand.  Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance  Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season).  I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's "brick and mortar" expectations online.  Easy win play: Just buy shares if you're scared  Autistic play: BBY 2/19, 3/19 $115-120c or near their ATHs. Also ROCKET SHIP EMOJI
GME Gain Porns from a week ago - Held the option for 2 days 📃
Well at least it’s better than it was a week ago. Guess I’ll just keep holding.
SGMO DD Numero 4: Orphan Drug Designations, Sizing up the competition, Fabry Trial Design, and pretty pictures of NHP Alzheimer’s data
WTF is SGMO?   The most undervalued gene\ \ \  editing company out there, hands down. Don’t believe me? Check out this valuation table   Company Market Cap   :- :-   Biomarin   Billion   Crispr Therapeutics   Billion   Denali Therapeutics   Billion   Editas Medicines Company   Billion   Spark Therapeutics (Acquired) Acquired for about \~4 Billion   Intellia 4 Billion   Intra-Cellular Therapies   Billion   Cassava Sciences   Billion     Sangamo       Billion           Hey man, your last valuation tables didn’t have DNLI, SAVA, ITCI in them…what’s up with that? You trying to make SGMO look better than it is?   I neglected to put those in, but I realized I should have because they are the other big player in the Alzheimer’s market and SGMO has a 750 Million dollar partnership with BIIB for Alzheimer’s. And yes, it does make SGMO look better considering how robust the pipeline is compared to some of the one-trick ponies. Meanwhile, you got SGMO out there in the trenches doing Alzheimer’s, hemophilia, organ transplant, CAR-T…             If you want the full story, please read my prior DD posts, linked here for your Redditing convenience  :   , the fat pipeline, wholly owned programs, a rumor about ARKG, PT, and positions    Investor Village for information to feed you apes, and a bit more of the ARKG rumors that haven’t panned out yet   , and my tinfoil hat conspiracy theories that aren’t that crazy if you follow timelines vs price moves as closely as I do.    So why are you posting again so soon, pumper? Got some big news?   Yeah buddy.   be awarded when the committee meets January 19th-21st, 2021.           What’s an Orphan Medicinal Product?   Although you could google it, I’ll just let you know it offers an easier path to approval and financial incentives for the manufacturer, since the small patient population would prevent the drug from being financially viable otherwise. Just another piece of news not reflected in the price.    Speaking of, look at this bullshit downward trending channel for no reason other than to make me see red (in my portfolio) everyday:            Speaking of stock price, remember ONCE from the table above?   They were acquired for 4 Billion for one approved therapy. Sidebar- a geene therapy for ocular indication was a smart strategic move because it ain’t hard to deliver to an eyeball (you inject into the eyeball and you’ve hit your target), and the biggest hurdle in geene therapy right now seems to be delivery. So they had a revenue geenerating product, and therefore should have been valued more than SGMO- makes perfect sense. What’s more interesting for us is that they also have a hemophilia A geene therapy, SPK-8011, just like SGMO. And just like Biomarin, the trial results are objectively inferior to SGMO’s.   Notice the factor levels in Phase 1/2 top out somewhere below 25 IU   (In case the monke strong crowd was wondering, IU is International Units, which is a measurement of factor level normalized to the general population, where 100 IU would represent the mean factor levels of a large simple size of a non-hemophiliac patient population. Factor is weird- you really don’t need levels of 100 IU to prevent bleeds, which is good because all the geenetic therapies seem to produce levels of factor that wane over time.)     SGMOs Phase 1/2 factor levels went to about…ohhhh…   . KILLIN IT. Of note, Truist issued a “Quick Thoughts” report on Dec 8th with a price target of $23 for SGMO following these results, and it only mentioned the Heme A program results, not any of the 16 others pipeline ventures SGMO has going on. WF has a price target of $36.    And now for something completely different:     .     Anything coming up, event-wise?   Aside from the stuff in previous articles,   SGMO usually has their full year conference call near the end of February, and they like to make big announcements around that time. FWIW, someone has been buying a LOT of February calls. Maybe SGMO is going to partner with someone diabetes-focused to treat Type 1 Diabetes, since it’s autoimmune and only a natural target for T-Cell therapy. But that’s just wild speculation I was hoping to manifest into existence.    TL;DR   SGMO wildly undervalued, buy OTM LEAPs and shares. More time is better I have no idea when the pop will happen with the way this stock is shorted and trades with no relation to inherent value. See previous posts for YOLO screenshots. Per a great quote I learned from u/CapitolGee “I might be early but I’m not wrong”  \ \ \ I had to spell it geene instead of the correct spelling because automod kept flagging it, which I get now that this place has been flooded with bots. The regular spelling is the ticker for a banned microcap.
Positions for the week of February 8-12/2021 1) Hedging against this SPY500 bubble and buying puts, with May expirations 2) YOLO on the LMND calls 3) OPEN is something useful and new 4) NET is going to report STRONG earnings and take off
SNAP - Play for next 2 weeks
This is not a financial advice and I am not responsible for any trades that you make based on this DD. Please do your own research and Due Diligence before investing into anything. This is literally me reading news and reports and summarizing for my WSB autists. This DD is my personal opinion and for entertainment purposes only.         Q4 Earnings -    Based on the report published on  , SNAP reported Q4 sales of $  million and earnings fell to a loss of $  million. This was a decrease of 42% from last quarter which is obviously good because in the last quarter they lost $  million in earnings. They were also able to beat the analyst expectations of EPS by   This is why the stock went up 10% after the earnings. They posted strong Q4 results and were able to beat all the expectations.       Analysis    The SNAP is little concerned over the Apple's IDFA policy and because of that they expect low revenue in the following quarter. The increase in users and revenue mainly occurred due to coronavirus pandemic. More and more companies started spending money on the social media apps to promote their products instead of Televisions or movie theatres. As coronavirus pandemic comes to an end, I expect decline in users and decline in revenues for the company. The brands would then start spending ad money on movie theatres, restaurants etc.     SNAP's competitors Instagram & Facebook has also seen growth in number of users. As digital ad budget continues to grow, there's no guarantee that they would all flow to the SNAP. I personally find ads on SNAP more annoying than I do on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. I expect Facebook & Instagram to collect more ad dollars compared to Snapchat over the period of time.     The stock was trading at 25$ ish during October 2020 and it went up 193% over the span of 6 months.             Insider Trading    The executives have been selling their stock for the past few months.              SNAP has a good presence in developed markets, however I think it faces difficulty when trying to enter the developing countries.     I also expect a little bit of pullback from the rally of 10% on Friday. I expect the stock to trade around 55$ in few upcoming weeks.       TLDR ; My position 63$ SNAP Puts expiring 2/19.
5-10x Play with MVIS
People here need to head over to r/MVIS and read some of the amazing DD those guys put out.  I’ve been in since last summer and it’s taken me from $  to $12.  It’s market cap has only been over $1B since it hit $7 so it hasn’t been on this sub much.  I’ve not seen a better community around and more sure fire play anywhere on this sub.  The company are open about wanting a buyout and reasonable estimates for BO start as low as 5B, giving it a share price of $35, and as high as 15B, giving a share price of $105.    I don’t do DD (not enough chromosomes), just read others and I’d say the consensus is around the 7-10B buy out, giving it a 5-8x range by summer.  Oh and because everyone here is retarded          Positions: 3700 shares of MVIS   TLDR: buy MVIS for an easy 5-8 bagger by summer and maybe even sooner.
this was bound to happen: GameStop Movie From Jason Blum In Development At HBO
For the Regulars, Those who call this home, Thank You.
I will try to keep this short. I've not lived under a rock, I know what WSB has done to go toe-to-toe with the old guard. Keep up the good fight. Inspired by WSB, yes I was looking to jump on some of the hype train, however I did hear your warnings about this not being to invest for my future. I sought counsel from my financial advisor:  I took 6k from my 29k traditional IRA and started a Moderate/Aggressive Roth IRA with a weekly transfer from my paycheck. I should be able to open my 401k through my part-time job soon as well and I believe they off a 3 or 5% match. So Thank you WSB. I am trying to invest for our future the best way I know how.     Edit: I read u/angieb15 post on r/bestof and I wanted to post this to say that you have indirectly help me take that final push.  Next Edit: I don't give a fuck if this is ment to be an investment platform, not why I'm here. Christ, if you toilet lickers can't actually read the context of this post, no wonder this place is rotting.  I've had my money collecting dust since I lost my previous job and been scraping to get back on my feet. Watching WSB, the of, not the rest of the vultures trying to pick at the scraps and claim they were always in on it. The breaking news, got my thinking of my own investments and what to do. My advisor set me down a path in content with for now. As my equity builds, we shall see then.  Till then, thanks WSB, except for you new flows. Fuck off to your own place
Investing in Clubhouse ( Alpha exploration co ) 📈
Is there any creative way to invest in Clubhouse ? It's not officially listed so I'm asking about any company cooperating with them or something like that.  I personally see a lot of potential, it can ( but doesn't have to ) be something like investing in FB, IG, SNAP etc. couple years ago.   I did some research on ways to invest in CB and couldn't find anything, that's why I asked here so we can start a conversation and maybe come up with something smart.    This is not a financial advice, I eat crayons.
Congratulating people who sold and also holding is a contradiction
People who bought at like 11 dollars and sold at 400 are the ones who MADE you guys bagholders. I don't have anything against them; make your money. But the way the system works, if you want the squeeze to happen, EVERYONE (or a vast vast majority) have to hold.   Like a week ago, people would be hated on for having 420 sell limits. And theoretically, that is true, because selling will drive the price down. But people DID sell, and those people made bank and are "paper hands".  The people with insane amounts of money are the most likely to be paper hands and sell once they make a profit. If you're a whale with 100k invested, you have so much more to lose than someone who YOLOed 400 dollars and can just hold forever. It sucks WAY more to see 100k go to 50k than 400 to 200.  Because of this contradiction, it is inherently extremely difficult to create a short squeeze because people want to reduce their risks and make money. I don't blame them. But you guys are hilarious congratulating the sellers at 300-400 (if you actually still are holding) because they literally swindled you lmao.
APE NO RETREAT, APE MAKE BIGGER NUMBERS
GME interesting read: what do think?
My prediction for the future of Wallstreet bets.
TL;DR: the some media-companys will probably use wallstreetbets community as a scapegoat for the next economical crisis'.       Wallstreetbets moved the markets in a significant measure. And has never happened before, that retail traders an a significant quantity have moved the markets and nearly destroyed a (semi?-)'big player' (like melvin).  If theres a next crash in this decade, the media (which one can take over by owning the majority of their stock) will probably point the finger on a social media community like wallstreetbets,   even for the case of some other force implying the crash.    an example:  some random event where a large institution caused a crisis \[insert other banks name\] ->  yes, but it was ~~russian hackers or~~ the reddit community wbs.     this is just a prediction, since humans are power hungry and some made a profession on lying. What made me think of this idea? this post:
Is anyone going after hedge funds with all that's going on or we're the "baddies"?
The manipulation is real and I'm so proud of you for not giving into their mind games. They made huge, huge efforts to beat us and they've failed over and over. Keep holding they're all in on us selling, it's their only option. Be patient and hold, Gamestop will rise regardless.
WSB Merch flooding the internet
Is the logo and this merchandise trademarked and the Merch authorized?
Why $SPCE is due a 60%+ surge in next 10 days and HUGE SHORT SQUEEZE.
$SPCE (Virgin Galactic) has been one of the best performing non-meme stocks this year and it is due to surge another +60% in the next 10 days that will precede a huge short squeeze. I will explain more below.       VIRGIN GALACTIC:    Virgin Galactic is a space tourism company that is moments away from FAA approval which will enable it to begin commercial operations this year. Virgin Galactic sells tickets for $250,000 per person that gives you a plan ride to the edge of space and 6 minutes of weightless bouncing around in the space ship looking back at earth.       TEST FLIGHT IS THE KEY:    February 13th marks the opening of SPCE flight window for their final 2 powered test flights to space. Weather permitting of course, this flight will take place this weekend or on the soonest perfect weather following day.  SPCE's last test flight FAILED. After the failed ignition, their plane glided safety back down to base, proving their safety systems worked as expected. After diagnosis, it was found the software responsible for igniting the rocket system had failed. Virgin Orbit also suffered a failed launch late last year due to the exact same problem.     Why should we be excited about this test flight if the last one failed?     Virgin Orbit since corrected the software issue and their next launch was a success! Proving the Virgin rocket engineers are capable of fixing this issue and leaving us very confident they have applied the same fix to the SPCE rocket system.  With this successful test flight, SPCE will gather all the data needed for full FAA approval needed to begin commercial operations. Let's not forget that this will not be their first successful test flight to space either!  This means the successful test flight could see Richard Brandon fly on the first commercial space flight as soon as late March.  When the stock was at $30, market analysts predicted a successful test flight could see the stock reach $54, which would equate to a +60% move.    The stock is currently $54.+60% increase will see the stock reach $86 IN ONE DAY based on successful powered test flight.         SHORT SQUEEZE:    According to MarketBeat, SPCE short interest is a fantastic 71% of the float to the tune of   BILLION DOLLARS.  Many options calls expired on 5th February, meaning Monday they will likely need to buy their shares. The stock is up +22% in just the last trading week and +128% YTD. Shorts are getting very nervous.  Successful test flight will see a huge surge in price as investors flood in to the company as it moves from speculative to viable commercial operations.  With 71% float shorted, we will see an absolutely epic short squeeze when shorts will have no choice but to cover their positions once on the success of the test flight.       WHAT'S THE PLAY:    This all comes down to the success of the test flight.    If you are betting the test flight will be a success (as I am), get in before February 13th when the flight window opens.    If you are betting the test flight will fail, short the stock before February 13th.
WSB helped Silver Lake Group make 113 million in profit. Nice!
Looks like Silver Lake Group owes WSB a huge thank you for  pushing the AMC stock price to 20.  They made a mint off it, and we are left holding the bag.  I still have shares in AMC and not selling, but only because they're pretty much worthless now. -60% 🤦‍♂️
If you’re not happy with Robinhood
Get out and go to another brokerage. This is what hurts them the most, at the end of the day. Remember that to Robinhood, the users are the products, not clients. They will be losing their product.  If you’re out of GME, you can probably be stuck to a position for a week.  If you’re still in GME, you are diamond handing, so you should be fine with not touching your portfolio for a week.
I hate to ruin everyone's good time, but someone has to be the voice of sobriety. It needs to be pointed out just how much the $GME chart looks like a theoretical bubble. This is not to say the ride is definitely over, but to begin to alert some passengers to the idea that they missed their stop.
What happened to AMC last night? Those spikes are massive.
HISTORY IN THE MAKING
Good morning! I'm hoping the historians call this  the great reddit revolution. This is essentially a silent battle of the class system. A group of average people talking on the wallstreet elite as a way of wealth redistribution. What makes it unique is is that not only do you have Americans doing it against the hedgefunds but you have middle class members of society coming together from other countries, to band together as a singular unit to say, "Hey, you dont need so much money that you can bet on businesses to die." Then you have stories of people taking the money and buying food, video games for kids, and donating to people in need..  Its beautiful and what makes it great is we dont have a leader, we arent planning revolts, we are using an internet forum to educate people on the stock market who are then deciding, we wanna bet on the hedgefunds to fail, to fail against the will of the regular citizens banding together to decide, we had enough of your corporate greed. We arent a group, we are a mindframe and its hard to kill something that doesnt have a   cant extort something without a name. We are one, we are all!     I love Movies  I fucking loving every second of it.
MSTR - Microstrategy
MSTR has alot of Rule#4, enough that their stock essentially tracks it.  It is up 340% the last 3m, 89% the last month, 31% the last week.  Call options are expensive, my only regret is I wish I had more than 4 shares @ $500.   The only reason I would invest in MSTR is if your broker, like mine (WeBull) doesn’t allow rule#4 purchases.  MSTR will continue to rise over time, hopefully at the same pace because MSTR is a stock, and stocks only go up.    POSITIONS:    TSLA / FNGU / SOXL / NVAX / CCIV / MSTR  shares
PSA to newer members of WSB.
I want to clarify a few things to some newer members.  You have taken a few jokes we make seriously and it will cause you to lose money.   First, FOMO is an extremely bad reason to buy a stock or options. If you have to every ask “is it too late?” It is too late. Don’t ever buy a stock after it has rocketed up to ATH.   This was a very very standard but of advice until GME made it’s crazy run. Now it seems like the norm. It’s not. It never was, and it never will be. GME is a once in a lifetime run. You will very likely never see another one.   Second, diamond hands. Pretty much the same story. Diamond hands was seen as a very very stupid thing to do. Anytime you nailed even a 2 bagger we would always always tell you to sell it all, or at the very least sell half to secure some profit and hold the other half as a gamble.   Another note on diamond hands. If you are not familiar with organized pump and dump groups please read up on them. They create runs on a stock, then convince other people to buy it while they sell off securing profits.   The 3 biggest ways to spot a pump and dump is 1 fomo, and 2 they tell you have diamond hands. (Prior to diamond hands they would say “it might dip, but that’s expected! Don’t sell it will go up!” Lastly they will always sell it as a sure thing. No stock is ever a sure thing.   New people that witnessed GME are making these pump and dumps extremely easy to pull off.    My last bit of advice, bag holding isn’t a sound strategy. Holding a stock because you are down on it and only because you are down on it is stupid. Plain and simple.   Only ever hold on to a stock if you really think it’s going to go up. (With good reason.) you can sell, take what money is left and buy something else that will return a better profit. When you lose, ask yourself, if I didn’t own this stock right now, would I buy it at its current price having seen it drop? If the answer is yes, then hold it, if the answer is I would cum in my pants for a chance to buy in at this price having no losses! Then double the fuck down and buy more.   I have been on wsb for almost 10 years. I learned to trade here. I don’t have a job and trade full time for my income. There are some very very smart people here, it is up to you to find those people and learn from them while ignoring or laughing at the retards losing money for the memes.   Lastly, inverse wsb is a very legit strategy, think about that. Doing the exact opposite of the front page of wsb has good returns. (fscomeau, I’ll miss you, you glorious bastard.)   Edit: someone rightfully pointed out that the inverse wsb strategy has gotten its ass royally handed to it in the last 8 months. So maybe I’m that old guy that is struggling to keep up with change.
Tip for all the Hollywood WSB / GME films / documentaries
Hello lurking film producers / fellow: "I want easy cash with minimal effort", apes.  Open "WSB: To the moon and back TM (c)" with a 2001: A Space Odyssey pastiche - instead of the usual black monolith, have it made from hundreds of boxes of crayons, which one ape prods, and then knocks over.  To The Moonwatcher then starts to feed on all the waxy goodness he has found.  Have a sub-plot featuring gourd buying / having the boat getting delayed and the gourds slowly rotting.  Another sub-plot: a member of WSB slowly becomes more and more ill over the course of the film, and they have no idea why.  At least their stonks continue to    , so they can still purchase wax crayons to feast on.  Have cuts / transitions using dire space-themed special effects. Eg: rockets made using painted washing up bottles, child-painted planets/ moons, etc.  The film's climax needs a 300-inspired HOLD sequence, using the most inappropriate people / cheap ape costumes.  Please message me for details of my royalties, thank you.  "WSB: Apes Together Wrong TM (c)" coming to a scribble pad no time soon. (As I have to research   some Musk-friendly "dodgy penny" free money, instead / I've eaten all my crayons, as the new glue dip made them too tasty for ape tongue.)     = lick monitor screen.
You know who has the hardest motherfucking  ? Papa Cohen. He did not set up any predetermined sales of his stock via rule 10b5-1 during the initial rocket launch.

We have to give it back to the bears.
All the newbies and noobs that have come to this sub after the Game Stop story (including me) we should leave the sub or be witnesses on the retardation only ... I think we shouldn't interfere in there way of having fun and yolo-ing there life ... that what is charming about this sub we have to leave it at it's for them. Being there is just gonna destroy it because of us normies these retarded fellows have found their pleasure so let's leave it for them for good... unless of course you need guidance or "How to be retarded for dummies" good luck... maybe I am the stupid one for not yolo-ing my money with you who knows?  As for me I will just keep an eye on the shit posts. What do you think our degenerate old fellows on this sub?
Bs. These retards dont even know what biotech means...
"GameStop’s unraveling accelerates as Redditors pivot to Biotech - The Economic Times"
It’s a long game now. So what now?
Thinking that most people have run out of funds or jumped ship since they were expecting short term gains. But the shorts are still there and the stocks are still volatile. So what now while we wait for our checks? Well I suggest for all our newcomers to look up some long term investing strategies, portfolio ideas, how to save to the penny and such. It’ll not only help you but any cause such as this in the future. If anyone can link some good sources and Youtubers in the comment section that would be dope ... because I’m too fucking lazy too so

Hey, all— been following the complete capitulation of this sub for a year now. Two things;  1) Advise is a verb. Advice is a noun   2) you’re all going to lose more and more money the longer you continue to neglect paper trading. The majority of posts are now concerning entries and exits, and queries on what options contracts are.   If you can’t recognize and explain the Greeks coherently to your wife’s boyfriend like you know what you’re talking about and under two minutes, or have no idea how to follow volume and volatility and how they will directly correlate to your positions, you just need to swallow it and accept that that apprenticeship you have painting interiors your uncle was reluctant to get you in the first place and only at your mom’s behest is probably what you should put your focus back towards.   Cheers
E-toro spamming me margin call warnings even though I NEVER USED MARGIN? (Already switched broker for new shares and still  🏻   out of stupidity...)
Shouldn't Melvin go under by now?
I have a lot of questions about the GME short on the hedge fund side. I'm low key hoping that a former hedge fund person/insider/trading veteran will share some insight, but hey, I'll take any answer that's backed up by research.  1. How does a hedge fund stay alive after sustaining billions in losses?   I've heard rumors of them selling their long positions to cover their shorts, having time to pay for the shares they shorted, and receiving a loan from Citadel. I'm assuming they've played both sides of the trade and took out new short positions based on recent prices.  2. If they are going under, then how long could it take? Are there historical examples we can point to,   late 90s/2008.   3. There was a rumor that a NY pension fund is affiliated with Melvin. Is this true? If so, what the hell would happen if an entire hedge fund gambles a pension fund away? Hoping they're smart enough to diversify their clients assets. Any historical examples we can point to?  4. I heard a rumor (yes, yet another rumor) that multiple hedge funds went under/sustained huge losses. Does anyone have specific insight into this?  5. Do we know generally or specifically what securities/assets that Melvin and other related hedge funds have/are invested in? I know we don't have much transparency in terms of investments in the US, but may be there's a well hidden publicly facing investor report that their clients receive.   6. If we don't know the assets they're invested in, how did we manage to find out that they were behind the GME short?   7. Do we know of a country with disclosure laws that require individuals/hedge funds to disclose their positions?

When I first joined this group there was probably 1m members. With 8   that number and now people from all sorts of investment backgrounds, I doubt we will see the level of retardedness we’ve previously witnessed.

Don't buy anymore GME or AMC (especially if you're new) unless you got money to burn or are too retarded to read this. Just hold.
This message is more orientated to new folk.  Its going to continue to drop so wait for that shit to go down to the dollar. We don't know if there's gonna be another squeeze by how the hedgies and RH screwed us over the first time. Them having all the bananas probably have found other ways to screw us over by now. Even Mark's AMA had a lot of "next time you'll come back smarter" phrasing as in the shit that happened here was phenomenal but most likely will have failed.  If it does fail, at least some people were early to buy nuggies. But people buying now is your own risk and not a meme. If it does fail, people well sell with well cash made. When that happens all the late apes will be left to dry for "long term investing" to hide the fact they literally lost thousands. And while losing thousands is great for meme purposes on this sub, all the newcomers are gonna be staring at the charts 24/7 never coming off the toilet.  If all you people who lost a ton of money do get gains somehow (because remember, people already HAVE gains, they just lost some because of the hedgies and want it back or some already cashed out with multi tendies) then consider yourselves lucky because these stocks are dropping and will continue to drop for a while and not everyone will have diamond hands.  Its hard to keep a meme going for so long. The memes are the only thing really pushing this. Once the meme dies, so does the volume. All the inexperienced traders don't know all the other smooth brained people are used to losing will continue to trade like normal, and they'll have nothing left but to stare at their loss cause of a meme and their poor timing to jump on a a bandwagon all late.  On a lighter note. If you already own GME or AMC don't sell yet, there's a good chance we'll at least get a small squeeze. Just don't be an actual retard and lose your life savings over this and keep buying when it hasn't finished dropping. And if you do buy.. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Diamond hands. Not for the sake of the stock but for your own sake..  This message is more orientated to new folk.   Not financial advice, just speculation.
I'm getting my inheritance from my trust tomorrow, should I buy GME stock with it?

Is it safe to post GME gain porn now?
Noob question. How are the shorts will be forced to buy when they cover when the limits from different brokers are still enforced?
Are those buys from cover will spam the clearing house?

Can we make a pen for all these retarded newcomer apes hoping to get rich quick?
can we make one megathread for gme and ban all this surplus of gme posts? Anything but this shit. You're all high on copium hoping to get out and let others bag hold. This subreddit isn't a gme subreddit. We're here to make interesting and autistic/retarded plays and gambles. Please go to r/gme. I miss the good DD's we had before the influx of normies.

Outlining the problems with Option hedging narrative
Hello WSB, honest new poster here. My experience is in commodities so I am actively looking for someone to correct me if I am wrong. I honestly have never worked with something that can be short squeezed, so listen to the comments not my post.  I’ve read the theories of the hedge funds using options to reduce their shorts, if I understand correctly and over simplified:  Hedge funds Sell Call options to a Market Maker, this gives the Market maker the right to hedge their length by selling Synthetic length, there the Hedge funds buy the length and voila shorts are closed, SI reduces. (Previously we were the recipients of these fake stocks, which is how shorts got over 100%)  However the hedge funds are left short options, which basically started this whole thing. What is not discussed enough is what strike of options we think they used, which is where I think there is 4 broad scenarios.   They sell Out of The Money calls, eg strike $800(OTM): This would have very low delta, hence the hedge funds would need to sell like 5 times their short to get enough length. And if the squeeze ever got to $800 then they would be 5 times more squeezed past that point.  They sell In The Money calls, eg strike $4(ITM): This would have effectively 100% delta letting them hedge fully quickly, but in reality wouldn’t change any dynamics, the call would almost entirely act as an already exercised short, making them short again unless price actually falls below $4.  They sell At the Money calls, strike = that days price(ATM): This would have about just over 50% delta so they would need to sell double their position to fully hedge. And if they did this man did they win so far. BUT they would have then doubled down on their position, the next time a squeeze happens it would happen twice as hard.  They bought Puts at any strike: This would have the same effect with MM hedging and Hedge Funds rebuying the length. But without too much detail, this would mean the Hedge Funds are paying More premium, increasing their daily costs and meaning the squeeze or fall better happen soon.  TLDR: If I understand correctly, Options to reduce SI is a way to hide but actually would make a future squeeze more prominent. This is honestly the reason I am holding ~75 stock at ~200 entry. And as I said at the start, I feel I am myself wrong so why would you listen to me to make financial decisions. Read the smartest looking comment below and make your own decisions. Also please link to the smart WSB articles explaining Short Squeeze, Short ladder attacks and Option Hedging that I can’t find at the moment.
Looking for stocks to invest in.
I own 15 different stocks at the moment, and am looking at investing in more. What are your suggestions?
Maybe the real moon was the friends we made along the way.
In all honesty, taking a moment to just appreciate the insanity that this sub gained literally millions and millions of subscribers in about 10 days, took over mass media and social media, made some idiots and sages thousands and in some cases millions of actual dollars is just a beautiful thing. Among those are folks of every political leaning, religion, race, etc.   Just incredible. Let’s keep going. Sorry for the hippy dippy post, but you deserve it. Ready for lift off in

Instead of thinking like GME bag holders, start thinking like GME owners
Many of us here are GME owners now, whether we currently like it or not. But, as owners, you have the potential to vote on company decisions.  The Venn diagram of GME holders and gamers in this subreddit is probably pretty close to being one circle. If we pooled all of our ideas for the company into threads, collectively voted the least retarded ones to the top, and proposed them to management, we could potentially grow the intrinsic value of GameStop ourselves.  Having a subreddit rebuild a company is not unheard of, given what the sub’s already done in the past. What if we could  be  the rocket fuel?
Who is the retard, really?
I own 200+ GME@199. Some shills and boomers like to come in here and call me and my fellow apes retards. Guess what? I bought a bunch of TSLA way back when the same guys said it was retarded. My TSLA stock has since increased with 1700% in value. I thought I’d take some of those profits and join the GME fun, because I like the stock, and I like apes. I will still be thousands of percent plus if GME would hit 0. I don’t believe it will, because something historical is happening and it’s a privilege to be part of it. All you haters will see down the line. Just like you have done with TSLA.
PSA: If you're thinking about buying travel stocks during the current off-season, know what to look for
Travel industry stock is already starting to recover from all-time lows.  However, January/February is historically the slowest travel period of the year. Stock prices for airlines and hotel services are already low due to:  (COVID-19 travel restrictions) + (Low Travel Time of Year) = Low Share Price     HOWEVER    Please know that some airlines and hotel services took on A TON of debt that will take a long time to recover from. Others relied on large cash reserves to make it through the pandemic and took on minimal debt.  The ones that borrowed the least amount of money from the government over the pandemic will be the ones with the largest and quickest bounce back when this summer's travel season hits with lifted COVID travel restrictions and the urge for people to want to get out of the house.  Minimal debt will make it easier for these well-off travel companies to be able to meet the sudden increase in demand this summer and get themselves back to pre-covid financial stability relatively quick.  The ones that accrued a ton of loan-debt will be the ones that you won't see much gain from for  YEARS  as cash reserves are  slowly  built back up.     The Main Point   : If you are interested in investing in travel companies during the current off-season of travel,    DO YOUR RESEARCH    to find the ones that have the strongest financial strong-hold when the travel season hits.   DISCLAIMER  I don't provide financial advise and read this on a bagel I toasted in my toaster this morning
More focus on Vlad Tenez testifying on Feb18
If we got more eyes on Vlad Testifying on Feb 18, wouldn't it help our GME movement? I don't know how but more media attention and focus would get more people to see that Robinhood screw the people on GME. What are your thoughts on that?

Late to the GME party
READ THIS IF YOU FUCKED UP
Many people are making a lot of dough with GME and AMC... and yes it sounds good to jump in, but only do it if you've assessed how much money you are willing to loose. I feel that some of you may have lost more than you can afford to lose, It was super easy to get caught up in the hype. I did, made some money, lost some. (close to break even now with GME) I feel your pain.  Take a walk, watch a movie. Maybe try recouping your losses with index investing, or something safer to get your mind off the market. Think of when a good time is to close your positions, There's nothing wrong with cutting your losses. I bought GME at 160, held and eventually dropped to 50, bought some more, Avg. price now 76. Make your own decisions and again ONLY INVEST WHAT YOUR WILLING TO LOOSE.  I wouldn't recommend trying to win your money back with other risky plays, using money you need yet again. Learn more about stocks, be patient. I would advise trying out the wheel strategy   or just index investing and dividend re-investing, or looking into Blue Chip stocks.  Please don't commit any form of self harm. If feel like you do, please call a help line. I love wall street bets and everyone in it.
My GME gain porn. 28k -247k
Pics first.   (It's a mix of 2 accounts, so I posted trades on gme from the bigger one, I also traded BB options and stonks in this time)  Posting on my alt, since a few people know my legit account and between money and mental health issues, it's just easier to avoid.   But I've lurked for at least 4 years, but hadn't post in a while.   So, here I am, divorced 2 years, young kid, awful depression & very suicidal, seeing a shrink twice a week who threatened to institutionalize me, and I'm newly medicated. (So I'm in bad shape, but doing what I need to for help)   My start up was already hurting, and tanked from covid, ex is trying to take kid to far away land. Dwindling savings which means I need a shitty, damned near free lawyer to not lose my kid. Late December get a letter from previous employer that they are gonna mess with a 401k l didn't move. Decide to move it. Due to a bunch of paperwork issues it took a while for the account to be funded.     mostly yoloed into GME options while half drunk on the couch of the woman I've been with on again off again since divorced. Knew how stupid this was because was a broker in 2008 when everything went to shit. I know enough to be dangerous, but in many ways clueless. Never actually did an option before.   What have got to lose? I mean I'm literally shopping for drugs to off myself every few nights. (Nembutal is realy hard to find) Ex gets 2nd interview in far away land. If lose my kid I'm 100% fucked mentally. Day after she tells me this account hits 100k. Was in bed with my quasi-girlfriend, and she saw the intraday high as double her annual salary.   Feeling weird anxiety all weekend. Wednesday account hits 250k, decide to take the options off the table and keep the majority of shares since this is enough for me to live at least 2 years and still have lawyer money. So, maybe this shit saved me from myself.   A bit of an epilogue:  took out a chunk, got a good lawyer, lawyer said there is little chance for me to lose my kid, and I'm in good shape. So yeah, this isn't a sad story, just needed to give context for how this lambo money is going to something way the fuck better than a lambo.
Just wanted to share my gains in my fist year on Robinhood. No BB, AMC, NOK. Bought one share of GME @ $225 for shits and gigs. Main gain was BNGO
EV batteries vs EV component mining
I saw something then I heard more and it that got me thinking and wanted some thoughts on it. With a huge wave of coming demand I wanted to look for opportunities in the periphery of EV’s.  So I have seen some articles and the talking heads have spoken about a coming EV battery shortage. There really don’t seem to be many EV battery producers. Tesla is a big one and they’re bringing in house. Lg is another (they are making batteries for Tesla).    There is lots of talk about recycling batteries. Tesla says they plan to. There is also opportunities to use the battery after its life in the car. I don’t see any companies that are focused on this.  There is an ETF $LIT. I’m not thrilled with it though.  So my thoughts lead me to EV battery material mining. With shortages this could be a good play but I’m not sure about long term potential.  So anyone have any ideas?
It’s about the lessons learned along the way💗 long GME & AMC    🏽 I’ve been (mainly lurking) here about 4 years and I’ve got to say this is the most fun I’ve had with you boys. 28k~>405~>135
Gamer Gains. GME doubled my portfolio. Could’ve had more but played it safe.
Pay no attention to the astroturfing   happening at the moment
You, like me, probably have noticed the large influx of bots and shills that have come into the sub and started posting anti diamond hand memes about the hedges winning and us holders as idiots. Pay them no mind. It’s a coordinated   to get you, the retail investor, to sell. Why? Well the reality is that the stock is still heavily shorted. Also this is a real test of corrupt capital. GME on this sub even a week ago was a populist disorganized movement against organized corrupt capital, or that's how the overwhelming majority of comments saw it.   With no deadline on the time in which they have to cover their shorts and pay back loans (in the case of melvin 20+% on a   billion loan) , it’s a game of chicken. For every day they don’t cover, they stand to lose a lot of money, and they are BLEEDING. They are using mimetic warfare to get you to lose confidence. This is called psychological (informational) warfare. If you’re holding, I say do you DD and maybe look at the underlying reasons (the short position) as to why the stock is a good hold. A the end of the day, fuck these bots/shills and fuck the SEC. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Bought in   shares at 290 and still holding. Diamond hand guys. Notice how the subs sentiment magically changed? How these inorganic or awkward feeling users magically came in and started making fun of us? Where there is smoke there is fire and when you are over target you WILL take flak. Diamond   hands   only guys.
It’s been a fun first year of investing for me. Shoutout to $PENN!
Is the fomo really our fault?
Carpe diem, yolo, fomo. Call it what you want but every marketing   I come across for financial enterprises touts the same banner,  Get in before it's too late,  you dont want to miss this once inaugural lifetime opportunity.  Obviously yes, you can infact blame the individual for giving into a sheeple mentality. This is just the norm.   But different markets come with stricter regulations.  My favorite example is the tobacco industry.  If the rest of the market was under the same scrutiny as the tobacco industry most leaders would be in jail.   Tobacco has limits on how when and where they are allowed to market their products,  they incur heavy fines and penalties at all levels of sales when people outside of their authority abuse the product.   And they're only allowed to earn the specific profit margins set for them by tax laws and min max price regulations.  This isnt a lobby for relaxed tobacco laws,  just my own realization of how fortunate we are to still be in a freeish market.  And how careful we all have to be to not fall victim to the big corps when they tell us were wrong.
Gained and lost a year's salary in a couple days. Made it out with a couple grand for my efforts. It's been a wild ride.

GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze
DISCLAIMER: This post is NOT Financial Advice!          This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets                  . In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.         In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.          I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling.                So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing   we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.          Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel.   for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.         With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options.   And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above. Thank you for taking your time to read my DD, my original post on wsb was removed by the mods. MODS please don't delete! This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got deleted, if this one does too, spread the word.        Edit: This post was removed, then reinstated, and I am now banned unable to comment and post to this subreddit      Edit 2: hi u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR , I would comment and post but I am literally unable to on this subreddit    Edit 3: I'm unbanned!
Mmm cheap as fuck
To everyone that been holding GME this past week an may still be holding, I have a question
Have you all looked at other charts this week. Companies that have been mention on this sub have been absolutely killing it! Stocks like SPCE, CRSR, APHA, DKNG, even BB have all ended the trading week with some pretty good gains. Yet this past week I’ve seen nothing but increasing positions, hold or nothing,  , and of course non stop conspiracies followed by loss porn that’s not even fun to watch. The real concerning thing is that I’ve seen a lot of posts claiming to be first time investors, dumping their small life savings into GME. My question is why? Is it just FOMO, like you still believe the squeeze hasn’t happened yet. Is it denial? Why not just except your losses and put whatever money you have left in the countless other winning bets?
Do your own fucking research
Hi there degenerates. News flash, everyone is trying to sell you something. People posting about some great stock and how it will moon for whatever fucking reason have skin in the game. Do your own fucking research! I see solid DD fairly frequently but just remember no one is out here to make you money. I'm happy for you and your tendies but I want mine more so fuck you. Have a nice day.  Disclaimer: I'm holding GME and I love meme stock but I don't fuck with TSLA because I am dumb.
Modest gains from EV and Banking
A message to everyone on this sub who thinks they know what they’re doing
I’ve seen a lot of people be very negative towards people who are making posts about their decisions with GME and AMC and a number of other stocks. First of all, this sub is about making bets not good decisions. If you think someone is making a bad decision you don’t need to be a dick about it. Another thing, you’re not smart just because you’re cynical, go back to school and actually learn something instead of spending hours on reddit every day.
$RIDE or die
Listen up, I’m about to hand you undeserving miscreants a 5-bagger, maybe 10, just by buying and holding.   , the only EV truck with four independent, hub-mounted motors.    The Company     Lordstown Motors is named after Lordstown, Ohio, site of a giant  . The factory spit out 16 million cars and trucks before being shut down two years ago. Car manufacturing was what Lordstown was built around, but people stopped buying sedans, and this factory only made the Chevy Cruze. You know anyone who drives a Cruze? Exactly. No one. That’s why they shut down.  But you know what people want? TRUCKS. You know what else people are buying? Electric vehicles. Too bad there are only those ridiculously ugly Cybertrucks that will someday, maybe, eventually, get built and sold at ridiculous prices. Too bad there’s only that hydrogen one that runs on MS Paint and vaporware. Too bad the other EVs are Chinese, so when you retards lick the windows, you get cancer.  Meanwhile, there are entire fleets of commercial vehicles looking for something to fill their needs. And you know who knows how to build all of that? A bunch of fucking unemployed people in Lordstown, Ohio! Enter RIDE. They made a deal with GM to buy the plant and get prototypes for fleet vehicles rolling off the line within a year.     The Truck    My God, look at this beautiful beast. Look at those sexy head . Look at those MFing solenoid coils in the wheel wells. Those taillights look like Cyclops and Geordi La Forge had an LED love child. Wanna touch it. Makes me hard.  75 MPGe. 7,000 lb towing capacity.   ton payload. 250 mile range. 109 kWh battery pack. Unnnggghh. Read it to me again, but slower. Aaahhh yeah.  Most important differentiator? The hub motors. They’re directly on the wheel, so there’s no transmission devices of any sort, so no wasted motion, no wasted energy. They’re designed specifically for the type of stop-start driving that fleet vehicles do. Think package delivery. And because they’re independent motors, they can individually deliver power, allowing true 4WD on muddy job sites, not the actually-its-just-2-axle design.  OK class, can anyone name a group of  ”? I know you can!  Who’s making the parts, you ask? GM. RIDE has full access to the GM catalogue of parts, so the company can just copy and paste the behind-the-dashboard stuff with confidence that it’ll work, that suppliers will come through, that costs will be reasonable due to bulk production in other GM vehicles, and most importantly, that the company doesn’t need to pay for the R&D. It’s already been done. RIDE is reinventing the wheel, but the rest of the truck is taken care of. Like your wife, it’s got that label on the outside, but it’s really someone else’s junk in her.  Who’s making the batteries, though? Samsung. Nuff said. And the motors?  .    The Money    Cool truck. Fine. Whatever. Can’t eat a truck, only tendies. So look at the numbers. The truck will sell for between MSRP of $52500 and an actual price of $45,000. Let’s take the lesser. It costs, the company estimates, $42k today and $37k by 2024. The plant will   up from just a few thousand this year to 100,000 by 2024. From there, the plant can produce 600,000 trucks per year. Dayum! That’s a lot of product! Isn’t that way more than anyone could sell?   No, retard. Look it up. The Ford F150 sells 900,000 trucks every year. The Silverado, about 600k. Nobody’s buying those boomer dinosaurs. 100k is nothing. It’s easy, especially when you’re the most badass EV truck available, and unlike the competitors, you actually exist in real life.  So let’s pencil in 100k trucks per year, sold at 45k and costing 37k. Let’s say it’s $130 million to run the G&A. That’s…$726k in profit by 2024, more every year after. Look, I understand most of you just want to SEC (middle word = Elon’s) all day long, so you don’t really understand the concept of profit yet, but trust me, it’s a good thing!  Right now the company has a market cap of $4 billion. It can make ¾ billion in a year. That’s a P/E of 5. What’s Ford’s PE right now? 10. If RIDE gets to the same PE (and it will go much higher because it’s not a boomer truck) it’ll double. If RIDE sells as well as the Silverado sells now, the PT is $222 at a minimum. That’s 10 times today’s price. In 5-6 years.  You’re welcome.    Positions:    50 shares @ $18; -6 22p 2/5 and rolling weeklies; +10 35c Jan22\ +10GME. Rocket emoji.
A Tale of Two Stocks
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way.  Thanks to industrialization, large portions of the population were uprooted and were herded together in large centers. This new form of existence, with its mass psychology and social dependence on the fluctuation of markets and wages, produced an individual who was unstable, insecure, and suggestible. He was aware that his life depended on boards of directors and captains of industry, and he supposed, rightly or wrongly, that they were chiefly motivated by financial interests. He knew that, no matter how conscientiously he worked, he could still fall a victim at any moment to economic changes which were utterly beyond his control. And there was nothing else for him to rely on.  The captains of industry, most of them in the United States, chiefly motivated by financial interests, did indeed infect the entire planet with their greedy materialism. One concomitant of such materialism is the spiritual confusion of our modern world. Another has been the hollowing out of money, which in the near future will make all savings illusory. A third is the emptiness of Western materialistic values, which has led to the degeneration of the individual personality.   Success doesn’t mean the gaining of wealth, position, or other advantage, implying things like advancement, upward mobility, getting or being rich, having power or status, achieving a prominent social position, or gaining acclaim or a respected reputation in one’s career.   The new success is people taking up their individual responsibility, accepting the challenge of personal change, achieving transformation, turning problems into opportunities, moving into their own power, working with those less fortunate, developing visions to inspire and energize others, and challenging the status quo.  When the time is fulfilled a new orientation will irresistibly break through, a thing unheard-of before: the right man sitting in his house and thinking the right thought will be heard 100 miles away. Neither propaganda nor exhibitionist confessions are needed.  Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think the commission-free stock trading & investing apps are a pretty neat idea.  We know now that we know nothing and that is the highest degree of ape wisdom. I view my fellow human not as a fallen angel, but as a risen ape.
Everyone   🤚 for $1000 and why we should be hoping for 3:1 x$100 instead
Think about this. Bulls and bears squabbling back and forth. HF’s dealing with massive potential losses willing to potentially taking legally questionable actions. Retail investors losing big gains and getting tin foil hat sick. GME’s market cap roller coaster making company moves difficult to plan.   If GME split shares 3:1, it could solve a lot of the problems for all sides.   1. Retail investors. Let’s say you bought in at $300 and now we’re down to $60. If a split occurred, your share would turn to three valued at $20. Demand surges from HF’s to help cover their shorts as well as 📄 🤚/new retail investors sending the stock back to $100. Your one share losing $240 is now 3 shares worth your initial investment. Also allows people to average down. For those average share under $300 currently, gains.   2. HF’s. If HF’s are short, they can grab a good chunk of shares to cover ~1/3 of their short position at a discount. The HF’s shorting at $400 currently would only need new shares to stay under $133 to cover. Stabilizes the beasts by their direct surge in buying the lower value shares to bring value up, positively impacting retail investors. Nothing will change some folk’s sentiment about HF’s, but it would be at least a more legal way for them to play their games while not borking the retail investor like they have been.   3. GME. The roller coaster stock prices/market cap make planning for investments/pivots by the new leadership difficult to calculate. By splitting and seeing a surge to find a common ground, in this scenario, GME’s market cap would be $21B. A lot for a “failing” game store (HF thesis for shorting) and to pivot for massive company evolution (bull retail investors/“I like the stock” crowd).   Ie. I have 100 shares. If it meme’d out and got to $1000 each, who’s to say the brokerages could universally (looking at you RH) pay out for people who dip out at $1000?  My 100 shares I bought close to the top ($300 for $30k) would then become 300 shares at $100, bringing me back even on investment but now in possession of a valuable asset I could choose to sell. GME has a stockpile of cash from these adjustments to make major moves in the market. If I hold my now recovered $30k, GME could go up based on new initiatives (especially after all this free publicity). If I don’t really love the stock, I can get out and get my money back. For those who averaged below $300 a share or hold shares from the before times, you end up with some pretty significant - and stable - gains with 3x as many shares in a company poised for a massive pivot.   Not a pessimist,   🤚 all the way. But, if I could triple my stake in a company I believe in and see my initial investment get back to close to even, watching GME have the capital to make some gigantic leaps at the expense of the HF’s fixing their mess by jacking up the new diluted share price, I wouldn’t exactly be mad. Plus new investors/people finally able to average down would see gains. That looks to me like 3 parties (current holders, GME and new retail investors) winning at the expense of HF’s fixing their garbage hands while jacking the price for shareholders.
Consider a pre-earnings LULU bet
after getting their frappuccino at Starbucks! They have menswear too which has been gaining popularity.  Someone recently did  . I want to add a few things:  \- The stock price has been struggling in the past 3 months (down 5%) but has started an upward trend last week.  \- Q4 earnings coming out on 3/25, and given how busy the stores were during the holidays can bet it's going to be awesome.  \- Currently, the most popular (highest open interest) option for this stock (across all expiration dates and strikes) is 380C 3/19/2021, so it seems smart money is betting on a big move prior to the earnings (although it's possible these positions were opened mid last year when the stock price was higher.)     My position:  LULU 350C 3/19/2021
WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK WAS NOT A SELL-OFF!
Melvin Capital has been and is going to continue throw a lot of tricks at us that will make it look like the stock is dropping even more this week. Don't fall for it.  Do not sell if you see any of these things happen:  1. GME drops by 30% or more after hours 2. SEC filings show that shorts have all exited their positions 3. GME drops below $1 a share 4. The GameStop locations near you start closing 5. GME files for bankruptcy 6. GME is delisted from the stock exchange 7. Your bank forecloses on your home for late payment 8. Your children have children of their own who grow up and become investment bankers and tell you that you should stop telling people you're "diamond handing" a company that went out of business 30 years ago   These are classic hedgefund tricks.
AMC update, holding through -$267k loss, bought options on the dip.
GME Catharsis
For the majority of us, the money we won or lost wasnt going to be life changing (edit: unless you bet a mortgage, then that is the way    ). Otherwise, the average person on here probably wouldve just paid off rent for a year or two? Or two nice vacations from the potential earnings had they sold @ 450$. I quite frankly dont give a fuck about the 5 digit missed profits or unrealized losses, I can make it back in half a year tops if Im lazy. Technically, I didnt lose anything yet as I plan to hold my shares @ average of 40 to the grave or give them to my great great children but you get my point.  It wasnt my first degenerate gamble and the logic and maths were there. It was a once-in-a-lifetime play. What grinds my gears though was when momentum was totally cut off last week and shit started crashing when no one could buy. We were on track to soar but we didn't count on brokers taking a piss. It blows.  I'm OK losing money I was willing to gamble. I have no problem sinking with the ship at this point, but not in an unfair game. Imagine sitting at a blackjack table and the dealer busts just for him to take a card off and say 'Oh yeah, I changed the rules. I unbusted! Hooha!!' What I'm upset about is that they had to bend the rules to beat us. We were on track to hit 1000$ per share had RH and other fuck faces not halted all ability to buy GME. What ever happened to a free market and land of the free?  My second disappointment isnt with the system, its in myself. Many moons ago, I used to work 9$ an hour scanning pineapples and bananas as a kid. Soon after college I worked a construction job for 15$ an hour till I found a more stable job with my college degree. I bought my shares @ 40$, I couldve sold each for 200,300, or even 400 easy. What happened? I got greedy.  Lets be honest with ourselves, most of us did the same shit. Everytime I hit the refresh button I was printing 2K and imagined ruling the world from a yacht in the Hvar with my GME shares. I was too fucking high off benjamin franklins to sell each share for 5-10X what I bought them for that I phoned my broker and set each share at 10,000$. The kid that used to buy freezies from the 7/11 for 0,50$ and dove a 500$ rust bucket to and fro college was setting each share for 10,000$ a share cause his head was too far up his arse, somewhere on the outskirts of Andromeda.  TLDR: The squeeze hasnt squoze, holding till alpha centauri      but let's take some time to do some gay reflection
The "Gamma Squeeze" Explained: Gamma Theory for Monke
Since GME's gamma squeeze 2 weeks ago, every monkey seems to think that GME is primed for another "gamma squeeze" every single day. Veteran WSBers almost certainly understand what a gamma squeeze is because a) It's not complicated b) Gamma was all the rage last March as SPY plunged into   the 6M monkeys that have flooded into these sacred gates within the last 2 weeks seem to be pretty oblivious. So, I want to help spread some knowledge so our community isn't filled with fucking idiots.   I'm going to try to explain some basic gamma theory, diluted-down so even you peanut-brain baboons can understand.    You do have to be literate to understand this, so maybe there is no hope for many of you.   You need to have a basic understanding of  options greeks , namely delta and gamma. I will briefly discuss them so we're all on the same page, but I'm not going in-depth because there are hundreds of posts in this sub explaining them in-depth, not to mention all the boring bullshit that gets posted in places like r/options.  EDIT: Putting this at the top since apparently many people are confused.   A "gamma squeeze" has absolutely nothing to do with a short squeeze  . Gamma squeezes are driven by large numbers of OTM option buying, whereas short squeezes have to do with short hedge funds buying back shares to cover their ass.  A short squeeze can happen without a gamma squeeze, and a gamma squeeze can happen without a short squeeze.   DISCLAIMER:  I have no idea what I'm talking about. This has nothing to do with my career and I've learned all of this gamma shit from reading tons of shit online. This is not a lot things, and it's definitely not financial advice.  There are probably tens-of-thousands of people in this sub that know way more about this than me, so if I say something incorrect, I will happily edit this to reflect that.    If you understand basics options greeks, skip ahead.   For the following, assume you paid $100 ($  per share) to buy-to-open 1 call contract with strike price $10 (I'll refer to this as $10C). You are now "long" this $10C. If you sell an option, you are "short" it. Each option contract is worth 100 shares, so you multiply delta/gamma by 100 to get net delta/gamma.      Delta  :  For every $1 move in the underlying, your option's price/value will change by delta.       For example: If your delta is   (or 25, same thing), then the value of your option will increase by $  for each $1 the underlying increase.   Stock goes from $5 to $6, then your $  call increases to $ , netting you a profit of $25. Stock goes from $5 to $4, then your call decreases to $ , netting you a loss of $25.      Long calls are positive (+) delta, short calls are negative (-) delta; long puts are (-) delta, short puts are (+) delta. Delta gets larger in magnitude as you go in-the-money (ITM) and smaller as you go out-of-the-money (OTM).         At-the-money options (ATM) have a delta of approximately   The delta of deep ITM options approaches   as you go further into the money. The delta of deep OTM options approaches   as you go further out of the money.     Gamma:    For every $1 move in the underlying, your     delta     will change by     gamma.         If you have taken any basic physics course, this will sound like   acceleration   to you...because it basically is. It's the 2nd order derivative of your option's value function.      If you have no idea what any of the above means, think about   gamma as the gas pedal in your wife's boyfriend's car  : when he floors the gas pedal, the car goes faster and faster, increasing in speed  exponentially . Once the car starts moving, it starts picking up speed rapidly because of the acceleration, and you go flying into the back of the trunk as your wife gives her boyfriend a quick handie in the front seat.      Long options all have positive (+) gamma, regardless if they're a put or a call;   short options all have negative (-) gamma  .   Gamma is largest at-the-money   (ATM) and decreases as you move both ITM and OTM.      For example: Delta is  , gamma is  , underlying price is $7. As price goes from $7 to $8 (approaching your $10 strike), delta increases by gamma to   and gamma increases to   As price then goes from $8 to $9, delta increases to   and gamma increases to   As price increases from $9 to $10, delta increases to    >   As gamma increases, delta grows exponentially     gamma increases because you are approaching the strike price. If that makes sense, then you basically understand how a gamma squeeze works.  Now before I explain what a gamma squeeze is, I need you to stop slobbering all over your keyboard- you're an ape, not a dog. Just because your wife's boyfriend disciplines you like a delinquent poodle doesn't make you one. You're a fucking ape, have some pride.  Okay anyway, I want to explain what   market makers   (  MMs  ) are because most of you orangutans clearly don't understand them either.    Market Makers    > When you buy an option, another degenerate isn't selling it to you- a market maker is .  MMs are large banks/institutions that have special agreements with your broker (sometimes they are your broker) to go behind the scenes and fill trades, providing essential liquidity to the market so you can get fills on your faggy delights (FDs). MMs make money by A) getting paid by the broker to create liquidity B) Scraping margins on bid-ask spreads. That doesn't sound like a lot of money, but when you're filling millions of spreads those pennies add up fast.  Since MMs will basically take any trade and  make money regardless of how the trade goes , they want to   hedge the trade so their risk is essentially 0  . To do this, they try to be "  delta neutral  ," meaning they want their net delta to be 0. If net delta is 0, when price goes up or down the value of the overall position/strategy doesn't change.  " Hedging! I've heard a lot of people use that word when talking about gamma! " is what you're probably thinking. Congrats, you chimpanzee, you're sort of starting to connect the dots.    MM hedging is what creates gamma squeezes.    > How do MM's hedge options?   Let's go back to that $10C you bought for $  (delta  , gamma   A MM was on the other end of that transaction: they sold-to-open (or "wrote") the $10C for $100. Now the   MM is short a $10C  , so they have    negative delta      and      negative gamma;    their net delta is -25 and their net gamma is -5. They want to be delta neutral, so they buy 25 shares of the underlying (every long share has a delta of   and ~~wallah~~ (edit: I'm stupid) voila! -25 + 25 = 0.   But, what happens when price increases?  You add gamma to delta. Your delta increases to +30, and the MM's options delta decreases (becomes more negative) to -30 (-25 + -5 = -30).  > Because MM's have negative gamma, their delta gets larger in size .    Negative gamma creates gamma squeezes.      Uh oh,  now the MM's net delta is -5 (-30 from the short call, +25 from the long stock)  they re-hedge by buying 5 more shares bringing their net delta back to 0. That share buying can push price up, leading to a vicious cycle of buying/re-hedging.    The Gamma Squeeze  !  >Everytime MM's adjust their hedge by buying more shares, that can potentially   further increase the price.   This means delta will increase, and force MM's to   buy even more shares to re-re-hedge  .   "Gamma" is in the name, so where does gamma come into play?  As the underlying approaches your strike  price, gamma increases in size. This means that delta increases exponentially. As a result, MM's increase the number of shares they buy each time: first 5 at a time, then 10, then 15 at a time. As price goes up,   MMs buy gamma     to hedge their short call.     As gamma gets larger, MMs hedge with more shares.    Without gamma, the squeeze would fizzle out quickly.     The setup:    >Gamma squeezes don't happen all the time.  You need the proper setup for a stock to get "gamma squeezed."  That setup involves   leverage   and   HUUUGE   (like the size of your wife's-boyfriend's-dong big)   AMOUNTS of deep OTM options  , two things every fucker here loves.  Let's say a stock is trading at $15. A few million idiots load up on cheap, deep OTM options at $30 and $50. These are stupid fucking options with deltas of basically 0, so MM's don't need to hedge them  initially . In most cases, these will expire worthless. For whatever reason, the underlying's price starts picking up speed and starts approaching those strikes.  Now, all of a sudden   those worthless calls have a non-zero delta, and that delta is rapidly increasing by a further-increasing gamma.   All of a sudden, MM's start buying a bunch of shares to hedge and the  rate at which they buy is increasing with gamma . This is all exacerbated by the fact that these FD's were so dirt cheap that   tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of contracts were purchased   by fucking brainlets.  So let's revisit 2 Friday's ago, January 22nd. GME opened around $40. The most OTM call strike was $60C with an open interest of 35k to start the day. By the end of the day, the volume at that strike was   180,000  . We can't always assume those are all buying-to-open, but looking back I think it's safe to say most of them were probably buying-to-open. Those options were   dirt cheap   at the start of the day because their delta was basically 0. By the end of the day, GME closed around $65 and all those $60C expired ITM, meaning a delta of    >  MM's actively hedge during the day as price moves  , so that means they had to keep buying shares as price moved closer and closer to $60. Because of this,   gamma squeezes happen during market hours  .  Again, you can't assume that all 180,000 $60C contracts were bought-to-open, but let's be reasonable and say 100,000 were bought-to-open.  That's the equivalent of 10 million shares that were purchased by MM's during the day to hedge their short calls  (total volume for that day was 200M)  - and that's just for the $60C alone . Thus, this was a textbook gamma squeeze that inevitably helped drive GME's 50% increase in price that day.    Will the GME Gamma Squeeze repeat:    >Now that you hopefully understand the basics of a gamma squeeze, I want to re-emphasize one point:  YOU NEED HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEEP OTM CALLS FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE.   Why did we get a gamma squeeze on January 22nd? Because the $60C were   dirt-fucking-cheap   so degenerates could   leverage themselves to the tits with calls.   Thousands of calls could be bought for pennies - these calls are worthless until they're suddenly not, forcing MMs to rapidly hedge and yielding  the glorious gamma squeeze.   What's different now? Implied volatility (IV) has been record-settingly high on GME options for the past week. Like   that were pretty much unthinkable until this event. That insane IV leads to options prices that get JACKED UP multiple times what they were before, especially at deep OTM strikes.  >   So those deep OTM options that fueled the first gamma squeeze are now multiple times more expensive, which leads to significantly decreased purchasing and thus cripples the prospects for a gamma squeeze.     Are MM's inflating prices intentionally to prevent a squeeze? Sort of- it's rising IV that's raising the price, but that works in their favor because it stifles the chances of a gamma squeeze.    Parting Thoughts    1. A gamma squeeze almost undoubtedly contributed to GME's rise, but I think whales took over after the initial squeeze and kept pumping the price. Maybe some shorts covered somewhere in there too. I honestly have no idea, which is why I'm not touching GME - although I am rooting for you monkeys to become bajillionaires. 2. In my opinion,   GME is not currently setup for an upwards gamma squeeze because there is not enough deep OTM call buying.   When you compare recent volume with what happened 2 weeks ago, it becomes obvious we're no where near setup for a call gamma squeeze 3. HOWEVER; as IV continues to decrease, that will make OTM call options cheaper again.   I am not recommending you buy those deep OTM short-term call options because chances are they will expire worthless  . With that said, that kind of ape-strength-fueled OTM call buying is what fueled the first   it can certainly happen again. Although I'm not betting on it.    Some important notes        MMs hedge constantly throughout the day   as delta/gamma change. The idea that options expiring ITM or OTM will lead to a gamma squeeze after hours is ridiculous because MMs are actively hedging into close. If your long call expires ITM, the MM is already long the 100 shares by market close. This is why   gamma squeezes happen during market hours  .      The exceptions are when ATM options expire with non-zero deltas at expiration. In those cases, there is stock tied to those options at expiration and that stock will most likely be unwound in afterhours. This is probably not what happened with GME.   Gamma squeezes can go   up or down  . Many of you seem to think that gamma squeezes only go up, but this is just wrong.   Squeezes follow the negative gamma   (MMs have negative gamma when you buy an option). If there's a lot of deep OTM call buying, that sets up for an upwards gamma squeeze; if there's a lot of deep OTM PUT buying, that sets up for a downwards gamma squeeze.      Right now, GME put buying heavily outweighs calls so, if anything, we're setup to squeeze lower.   When there is   net option buying   (be it puts or calls) that creates   negative gamma   (the MMs)   which fuels volatility   and exacerbates price movements.   When there is   net option SELLING  , that creates   positive gamma     which suppresses volatility   and favors mean reversion to the largest gamma strike.      I'm of the belief that positive gamma creates a lot of support for SPY, and I use it to guide my SPY positions. It's worked out well for me, so that's why I use it.     Seriously, don't buy deep OTM short-term options  . 99 times out of 100 you're throwing your money away (that's why the delta is basically 0).   There is a lot more nuance to this, such as options expiration, IV, long/short positions, and other things that are too complicated to discuss in one post. I've tried to simplify things, and hopefully I didn't make any mistakes in the process. When you consider that MMs are short some options and long others, it makes things more complicated.
Wall Street look ahead for the trading week beginning February 8th, 2021
Good Saturday afternoon to all of you here at r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

In order to include as much data as we have available, we are using DJIA data since 1901, S&P 500 since 1930, NASDAQ from 1971 and Russell 1000& 2000 data beginning in 1979. When comparing post-election year February to the recent 21-year February seasonal pattern, the overall shape and trend does not change greatly however, weakness becomes more prevalent as the mid-month surge is less pronounced and second half declines expand.  > ######   (     > Breaking down historical performance by year confirms frequent post-election-year February losses, most notably by NASDAQ and DJIA. Generally speaking, when February is positive it is an “ok” month, but when the month has been down, it has frequently been down by sizable amounts. There are seven double-digit losses in the table and not a single double-digit gain.         > # Typical February Trading: Lackluster Over Last 21 Years  > February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&P 500 has averaged a measly –  Over the last 21-year period S&P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of   in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like yesterday, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities over the last 21 years. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been somewhat disappointing for bulls.  > ######   (            > # As Goes January, So Goes The Year  > Stocks got off to a nice start in 2021, until the late January selloff, as everyone got GameStop fever. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2021?  > There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?  > As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up   on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only   on average over the final 11 months and were higher barely 60% of the time.  > ######   (     > “A weak January could foretell of rough times ahead in 2021,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The good news is lately the trend has been broken, as stocks have done quite well after a weak January.” In fact, 8 of the past 9 times January saw stocks lower the final 11 months finished higher.  > ######   (            > # Have We Seen the Top in Negative Yielding Debt?  > Negative yielding debt has been one of the most extraordinary and peculiar consequences of global monetary policy initiatives, turning the basic premise of fixed income investing upside down. Instead of one party lending another party money, and the lender receiving interest in return for the risk incurred, since 2018 the levels of outstanding debt in which the lender pays the borrower for the privilege of loaning the borrower money has skyrocketed. This has left both lenders and fixed income investors in the unfortunate situation of attempting to “lose less” rather than “earn slightly more” than the value of the loan extended.  > The total value of negative yielding debt around the globe set a new record in the final month of 2020, eclipsing more than $18 trillion as governments around the world issued debt to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of these bonds are issued by governments in the developed world such as Japan and Europe, while US Treasuries remain one of the few sovereign bonds in the developed world that held positive yields throughout the pandemic. Though the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping short-term rates near zero for the foreseeable future, it should come as a relief to investors that thus far, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has dismissed the idea of negative short-term rates in the    > However, negative yielding debt does affect   investors. Even after accounting for the costs of hedging out currency risks, Japanese investors can obtain 70 bps more in yield by investing in the   10-year Treasury note compared to a 10-year Japanese government bond, while German investors can earn   after hedging costs, compared with the   current yield of the German 10-year bund, which is the highest level in nearly five months. These factors increase demand for   debt, which has helped to depress Treasuries yields and   the outlook for fixed income investors.  > What does the future of negative yielding debt look like? As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the good news is that this amount of negative yielding debt has declined substantially in the past two months and fallen back below the previous record high set in 2019. We believe this amount should continue to fall in 2021 as global economies recover and safe-haven yields rise, contributing to the 10-year Treasury yield moving toward our year-end 2021 forecast of  –   > ######   (            ######   (    ######   (    ######   (            Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:         > #    Monday   Before Market Open:    > ###### (   > #    Monday   After Market Close:     > ###### (          > #    Tuesday    Before Market Open:    > ###### (   > #    Tuesday   After Market Close:     > ###### (          > #    Wednesday   Before Market Open:     > ###### (   > #    Wednesday   After Market Close:     > ###### (  > ###### (          > #    Thursday   Before Market Open:     > ###### (   > #    Thursday   After Market Close:     > ###### (          > #    Friday   Before Market Open:     > ###### (          > #    Friday   After Market Close:    > ###### (  (NONE.)         > # Canopy Growth Corporation $    Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC)   is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 6:00 AM ET on Tuesday, February 9, 2021.

PSA for "diamond-handed apes"
"It's not a loss until you sell"  Guess what?  You can never gain unless you sell either.   Trading is fundamentally easy: 1 Buy low 2 Sell high 3 Repeat  You broke rule one or two (maybe both), now you're holding a bag, and trying to find a greater fool to take it off your hands at more than $450.  Here's some tough love: You won't find one.   You can run with the herd, but when it changes direction and runs the other way, be prepared to change your mind.  There's no rule that says you have to make your money back on the same company you lost it on.  Next steps if you actually want to be a trader: Cut your losses. Lick your wounds. Learn a lesson from all this. Commit yourself to actually learning your craft. Recapitalize. Put on your big-boy pants. Get back in the game.

The good news about your GME story
WSB has a huge number of new users, many of whom are first-time bagholders as well. I think we should welcome the new users with open arms. Hi. Welcome.  I'm going to talk about the past few weeks and where things could go from here.       THE PAST    In my opinion, no matter what happens going forward, GME was a total success. It was a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence and retail traders made it happen—that's amazing. It's now an international story. Incredible. I know it's still developing and I'm not informed enough to comment on specific outcomes here, but I think it's awesome. It happened, in large measure, because of the awesome due diligence written by some of the hyper-smart retards of this sub.  A big part of the story is DFV. I caught on to  . That's... I don't even have a word for how cool it is. His red headband and aviators belong in the Smithsonian.  Some folks made a ton of money on GME, and some are bagholding a fat loss. That's OK. Even the best traders have losses. And it may prove to be super valuable to some of you, because that heavy bag you're holding has a voucher tucked into the side pocket. Yep, right there... no no, outside pocket—yes. See it? That voucher holds a tremendous opportunity:    It's the opportunity to stop being a dumbass  .    But how?        I'm gonna briefly diverge here to talk about my WSB story. I joined summer of 2020, knowing nothing, but was drawn in by these insane GAIN posts that kept popping up on my feed. I didn't know what a fucking call or put was—shit,  I didn't even know how to buy a share of a stock . But I lurked, and obsessed, and kinda started to figure things out, little by little.  Then came Purple (PRPL). I read the extensive DD, I followed the stock price movement closely, I even followed the CEO on Twitter (he doesn't tweet much). I looked into the play as much as I knew how, and when I pulled the trigger  I was so confident . I sunk $  into debit spreads (something you too can learn!), which was more than I was comfortable losing. But I was confident—they were going to crush earnings so it was pretty much a guarantee.  Well, earnings missed. Just a bit. The stock dipped and kept dipping. Over the next week I was down something like 80%, I don't remember exactly. I was pretty crushed. I was so mad at myself, "Of fucking course a stock can go down,  why would you think it can only go up? " Recrimination, doubt. I knew I wasn't cut out for this...  But I kept coming back to WSB if only, at first, to salve my wounds with the loss porn of fellow fallen PRPL nurples. Then I watched more YouTube videos on options. And I learned—mostly from people on this sub—how to minimize the financial pain of that loss, and maybe break even.  I bought shares, I learned how to sell covered calls. I don't remember exactly everything I did, I was experimenting and learning. After a few months I eventually I broke even.  And I kept experimenting, and watching, and reading.  Beginning of this year I deposited a bunch of money into my brokerage and put myself in really solid positions that I liked. I armed myself with knowledge, I knew my entry points, I knew when I wanted to take on more risk.   As of today, I am in spitting distance of doubling my account since the beginning of the year. That fucking rules.    I'm still learning. I don't know everything. In fact, I think I'm still a novice, and who fucking knows I could blow my account up tomorrow. But the more I learn, the more the picture of trading becomes illuminated, instead of the inscrutable dark mass it was six months ago.       THE FUTURE    I don't know what's going to happen to GME in the next week, month, year. No idea. If you want to hold GME forever and not really think about the stock market, that's totally fine. But, if you want to dig yourself out of a hole, if you want to keep going with stonks, here's the good news: you can learn.  So what do you do now?    Shut the fuck up and listen to smarter people  . And read. And watch videos. And see what experienced traders and investors are doing.  Because this sub has recently turned into a roiling ocean of samethink, many of you don't know the power of this place:  you're sitting on a fucking gold mine . I have read due diligence in here that rivals that of professional analysts, and in some cases is  more insightful and more detailed  (and always funnier) .  And IT'S FREE.  Do you think DFV got into GameStop on a whim? Because he thought it would be a fun little troll play, and that maybe he could stick it to the hedge funds along the way? No. Go watch his YouTube channel. He knows what he's doing. He is a   fucking pro  .  Remaining stupid isn't an option—you want to be a  smart  retard, not a  dumb  retard.  Before I get too Glengarry Glen Ross on y'all asses, here are some tough love, concrete suggestions:       Stop posting and      telling      people to buy, hold, or sell stonks      That's not your call and it may be illegal   It's amateurish and cringey   It's perfectly fine to share your positions or say you're still holding       Stop calling it a movement      We're here to make money, learn, and help each other do both—it's not a political movement   It's profoundly cringey       Stop spamming posts asking if GME, AMC, BB, NOK will "go up"      No one  really  knows    You  decide whether you should sell or hold   If you have relevant information about the stonk, that's great! Post it. "Will XXX go up?" is not relevant.       Take a break from reddit, your broker, even your computer/phone      Staring at a stonk for hours, hoping it will go up, is not healthy—trust me   You'll be doing your brain a service if you step back and come back refreshed        People to follow on reddit                          People to follow on Twitter       Chris Perruna   \- at CPerruna    Duckman   \- at duckman1717    Richard Moglen   \- at RichardMoglen    Puru Saxena   \- at Saxena\_Puru    Ben   \- at PatternProfits        YouTube channels to peep       InTheMoney   \- I learned almost everything I know about options and the greeks from this channel    TastyTrade   \- Next level options stuff, extremely helpful    Richard Moglen   \- CANSLIM trader, very technical which isn't everyone's cup of tea but I like him    Daniel Pronk   \- Fundamentals focused, value investor    Roaring Kitty   \- This is DFV's channel     Happy to edit these lists if anyone has suggestions. Again, welcome to all newcomers. Let's help each other out.    TLDR: If you're new here, take your licks and step away for a bit. Come back with a fresh mind ready to learn and make some damn tendies.    EDIT: I had links to all twitter handles and YT channels earlier but automod wouldn't let it post, sorry.     POSITIONS:

There needs to be a truce between Gme holders and old timers
This is getting ridiculous. Half the sub is yelling HOLD and the other half is yelling SELL. I'm holding my shares and i don't need you apes to tell me when i need to get out. I will when i'm satisfied.   And GME people need to slow down with their spams and circlejerking. I agree it's making the sub ridiculous.  We can all co-exist in this sub. No need to tell people to go to another sub just because you don't like it. Things change and GME was much bigger than a sub with ~2 million members at the time.   This unrest will destroy the sub not gme holders or old timers.  /endrant  Edit: with 8 million members now, you can't just attack whoever says gme. As old timers you need to show the way of WSB. Or you can go to another sub and let this one rot. Your call.  Edit2: The response this post got just shows the "old timers" are just angry fucks. There are more than 6 million new members. Whether you like it or not, if you act like rabid dogs you will always be the minority from now on. If you are not willing to even take a small single step, you can get the fuck out of here.
Stay Vigilant and Skeptical
There are so many imposters among us, and if you're new, it might not be as obvious. This is one more post to remind you to remain skeptical and analyze the posts you're reading and do your own DD. I'm not a super OG here, but I've been around for over a year and it's insane how obvious the trickery is, how many super manipulative posts and comments I'm seeing that oppose this sub's mantra right now. SO MUCH sudden gain porn amount gme sellers, posts trash talking holders, saying holding is a bad strategy when you're down, and posts trying to justify selling right now in any way possible. They are designed to sound logical, or even be filled with a few logical points, with the part about how you should sell carefully transplanted in. BULLSHIT obviously. Listen, retard, you don't typically buy SHARES to try to make a fat short term gain, you trade options, so anyone convincing you that it's a normal, good idea to buy and sell shares on highs and lows in a small time frame is a dumbass. If you buy shares, you typically hold for longer than a fucking week and go for a ride for some real growth; or you learn your hypothesis was wrong or was changed by an event and you pivot. This is normal. Yes, there is a potential squeeze, which is more reason to keep your fucking pants on. Yes, the hypothesis has remained 100% unchanged, though certain news sources will try to have you believe otherwise. Missing a high isn't the end of the world, be patient and it will inevitably surpass that price in some amount of time if the company isn't doomed (it's not) and the economy isn't tanking (it's not). In this case, probably pretty god damn soon. At least if you don't listen to me listen to fucking Cuban, his words were a blessing for this sub, powerful messages to keep us united through this shit storm coming from someone that has a lifetime of experience. Remember why you bought GME, has it changed? Then continue pursuing the value play you started until it does. If you bet more than you can afford to say goodbye to for months/years, you probably fell prey to fomo and are an amateur. That's not ideal, so don't ruin your life over this shit, be realistic. If you can afford to, it's common fucking sense to hold right now. Hey, now you get to learn to weather a storm like any seasoned trader so SIT DOWN, BUCKLE UP, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP.   This is not financial advice I literally just got done snorting glue.   GME to Andromeda and past
Hard Truth: It's Entirely Mathematically Possible for Shorts to Cover Last Week
If a share can be shorted multiple times, it can be bought and covered multiple times.   How did 140% short ratio happened:  A has one GME share, A loans the share to B, B sold it short to C, C loans it to D, D sold it short to E. One share, shorted twice. B and D both needs to cover their shorts when they needed to.   The same scenario can be played the other way around.   Hedge Fund A bought 1 share from Bank B to cover and return to Bank C, Hedge Fund D then bought the same share from Bank C to cover and return to Bank E. One share, covered twice.   Now imagine last week, the price is above $200, you are a greedy ass Wall St bank and you have a lot of GME shares on hand and a lot of shares loaned out, do you :  (1) sell it to the shorts multiple times for ridiculous gain yourselves?  or   (2) just shrug and let the retails take this cake?  The trading volume for GME is above 300m per week for the last  4 weeks, with the highest week to be 550m.  the short float was 72m at its peak. The trading volume is enough for them to cover multiple times every week.  Have they actually covered? Your call. Fuck if I know. We will find out in Feb 9th.

Another    loser checking in
Forgot to eat my crayons for breakfast
New to the options world, was excited to buy a call. Placed orders yesterday, immediately rejected due to funds not clearing. Dumb brain me keeps yelling at ToS like “the fucking tendies are sitting right here, in the fucking sauce bucket” I never paid attention to the lil’ spoop   telling me about funding restrictions on options under all shit clears. They groomed me with the immediate funding for buying stocks, etc etc.   TLDR: crayons hard chew, so forget read words, no clean money, can’t buy the shins.
After some extensive research, I present to you my master findings for the future of $BB
You're missing another short squeeze play
All of you smooth brained retards wouldn't shut the fuck up about GME long enough to read the small handful of TLRY posts that smarter retards posted. GME is finished, shut the fuck up about it already. This is wallstreetbets, if I see one more "long-term hold" post about your fucking GME I'm going to throw poop at my wife's boyfriend. get your money out, make some fuckin plays, and get those tendies back you fucking normies. TLRY is already up 70something percent in a couple of days and you're missing out because you keep masturbating to your massive red dildos from GME.
BATTLE PLAN! LISTEN UP APES AND DIAMOND HANDS! PAPER HANDS AND SHILLS SHOULD NOT REPLY! THIS CAN BE OUR CHANCE TO MAKE A RETURN TO THE TABLE!
Fist of all, fuck the SEC, Fuck hedgies and fuck Melvin, I have nothing to lose so lets do it!  # This is for those who are on loss, are not selling and are waiting for the squeeze 400$+ either to moon or cover your losses.  As you have have noticed the new reports are out, it may seem that the 120% is out of the table but apes still have a chance.  # This will require work and dedication for those involved.  IF the numbers apes have are any indication to go by apes still have a chance.  Lets talk some numbers:  The reports are of a   short interest, yet apes can make some interesting math with other numbers.  The  Shares Outstanding is of       this is the reported total number of shares in GME this takes into account all shares including those of the company itself and private.  Before the report    61M   shares were being shorted, this was  at 35$ a share.  according to the Bloomberg terminal that is what professionals use to invest it has now around   21M   or more shares being shorted (  I BELIEVE ITS MUCH MORE AT THIS POINT  ). This number surely has changed to a bigger number over the week.        # if APE can read keep going...  # The graph below is not 100% accurate as this info varies from source to source (you may have noticed this)        This is the max pain theory, what this graph tell us is that with the stock at 70$ or lower most owners stand to lose, meaning there are more positions at that point and higher for buyers. As you can see in red is the majority of the PUT or shorts. This can also mean that most people would be profiting at the 120$ or higher share price. And hedgies will be bleeding again at 120$    Moar numbers for apes...    As of   today  , GameStop's   is      .  This number seems to vary from many sources.  # THE PLOT THICKENS  # The outstanding% can be as high as     according to the Bloomberg terminal which usually the most accurate place to look at.           At the same time it reports a FLOAT of 72%... this mean 72% of the shares are open to the market.  This can only mean that the outstanding% is being manipulated by many maneuvers which surely includes the interest short % and other factors. This tells us that HFs are inflating the outstanding% by many different means, this can mean that the FLOAT is also inflated.  If they have inflated the outstanding so much to   it makes difficult for then to cover the   interest. In fact it seems like a very hard task without having to BUY IT HARD!     # NOW TO THE PLAN!  We need to grow the value above the max pain. Hitting around 120$ will possible trigger another big growth and squeeze!     # BUT APE IS BROKE APE HAVE NO MOAR MONEY!     Apes this movement have received global coverage, what I investigated is that the biggest growth in value for GME happened during the time #GAMESTOP and  #GME were trending on twitter.  Apes need to make twitter accounts and make the movement noticeable for the news again.  # APES DO IT!  # THIS WORKS!  # RECAPITULATING  OUTSTANDING% is OVER 143% and the Shorts are   this means they are in a difficult position to cover their shares, even if with an inflated FLOAT,   reports a float of 45% which may or not be more accurate than the current inflated float on Bloomberg. According to the MAX PAIN, if apes grow the stock to 120$ HEDGIES WILL BLEED AND HAVE TO START COVERING! THIS WILL TRIGGER ANOTHER SQUEEZE!     # THE MARKET CLOSED AT   , GETTING TO 120$ IS REALISTIC IF APES GO ON THE ATTACK!     Lets make the paper hand bitches that sold at loss feel the heat lmao!     # APES CAN DO IT AGAIN!  not financial advice im retaded
Hi Melvin, Hi Capital. This is a negative post. Can I have some money please?
I hopped on the GME train quite early. 95 @ 33 dollars. Fuck man, why didn't I sell at 480? Why didn't I sell at 300?  Should have seen this coming. Well played hedge funds, you have won. I knew wsb was about losing money not making it. It was just a conspiracy by this sub to hype up a stock then those hyping it sold at the top leaving all the people they suckered in to holding the bags.  Just kidding  #BUY AND HOLD GME YOU FUCKING RETARDS   76% SHORT INTEREST MY ARSE  Melvin sincerely  🖕  Edit: aahhhh hugs. Fanx!
Institutional ownership of GME at
Everyone is talking about the   short interest, but there's another metric that Finra released tonight that's extremely interesting:  Institutional ownership is now at a whopping  , a net increase of 20,525,480 shares from last report.      edit  The numbers published reflect the settlement date data from Jan 29, so not reflective of current data. But that's still an insane ratio. Institutional ownership over 100% usually signals shortselling. Sure some oversight could be just from delayed filings... but these numbers are staggering.

Keep the pressure on RobinHood.
I know things haven't worked out how many of us had hoped, and there's a lot of blame thrown at different places, but I want to see RobinHood cease to exist. Never forget their underhanded practices and keep telling everyone you know to avoid them like the plague. Family, friends, even checking out at a store say "Thanks, have a nice day. Don't use RobinHood!" on your way out. They're making every attempt to bounce back from the bad PR of this with their ad   - don't let them.
Disagreeing short interest reports for GME: proof of market manipulation?
I've been following GME today since I have read some DDs on the hedge funds allegedly manipulating the market, but I think we might now have hard proof that they indeed are doing it.  When the market closed at 4pm people there were immediately links showing GME to have a   short interest from more than one website including MarketWatch. I don't know whether it was legitimate users or bots posting them. Meanwhile, Finra had no new results and were still showing the old short interest value for some reason.  Now, Finra has finally updated and came up with a   short interest, definitely more expected since it's very reasonable to think that at least some hedgefunds have not covered their shorts.  What interests me about this difference of almost double is that it seems to speak of obvious market manipulation from the hedge funds. They must have paid off the earlier websites to publish a false   result. How else could you possibly spin it?           Disclaimer: I am simply trying to be objective and share my observations, as well as one opinion based on these observations. Make your own decisions based on this information. I am just a complete bystander who does not own GME. I am also one of the noobies who just found this subreddit due to GME so please point it out if I made a glaring mistake.
Psychedelics, PSYK, CMPS, MMED, your guide to new horizons
Medical Psychedelics are the next moonshot, missed the weed gains? Worry not, these stocks are where weed was 10 years ago.   Missed Palantir? Don't worry, Thiel has got another company to make you rich if you get in early.  Peter Thiel and Kevin O Learly are deeply invested, the world's first psychedelics ETF was launched this year (PSYK) by a reputable Canadian Asset Manager.   I just tossed half my portfolio in these, the rest in NIO and BABA.   Lets make Psychdelics the next story the media can't resist. Every Boomer / Grateful Dead fan in their 50s-60s will be buying in with their old person stacks of $$$ as soon as this gets mainstream. Plus, they are tackling mental health and addiction, both hot topics in today's world.
The game is rigged but  ✊✊✊ can still win!
Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.  For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.  There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:    Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this "insane"? $5k? $50k?   GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.  People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.  I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.  Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out   my share  ???      If $GME$ hits $150 this week I will buy every single item on r/activedeals & donate it to my local hospital.
If Amazon buys AMC we're going interstellar.
Sorry that you GME'ers got burned by manipulation. Hedgefunds can do all kinds of shady shit under the table and probably "legally" exited their positions in ways that we didn't even know were possible. They're all buddies at the top and you can be that they're not going to lose anymore than they have.  There are rumors floating around that Amazon will buy AMC, this is probably a good business move because after covid chan's wraith, people will want to go out and do stuff again. We're going to see a resurgence in malls, restaurants, bars, but especially movie theaters. The vast majority of people live in shitty little condos and going to the movies will make us feel normal again.  You could maybe risk GME like a total fucking idiot, but I think AMC is the play.    EDIT: wow, fuck you guys. My sources are from a robinhood notification this morning      EDIT 2: wow, fuck you guys again. Here -

The Story of WSB in a Nutshell
A little story about $GME
The year is 2050... a civilian is strolling along the city streets and notices a homeless man in a large coat with a hood over his head. The homeless man is sitting on a park bench, rugged, clothes drenched and stained. This man has evidently been homeless for quite some time. Our friendly civilian approaches the homeless man, a single dollar bill in hand. “Excuse me sir, I don’t have much to give, I paperhanded GME back in 2021, but I hope this dollar helps.” The homeless man looks up, through the grime and dirt on his face our civilian is still able to recognize him. “Oh my goodness, you’re Diamond Hand Dumbass!” “Indeed I am.” Replies the homeless man. He struggles to outstretch his hands, as they’ve become increasingly heavy from years of hodling GME shares. He gratefully accepts the mans single dollar bill... “This dollar is more than I deserve my new friend.” Says Dumbass. Dumbass pulls out his Nokia flip phone and dials up his broker. “Yes I’d like 10 shares of GME (the stock is now 10 cents a share).” He once again averages down his share price. The friendly civilian looks at him completely astonished... Dumbass gets off the park bench, looks to the man, and before walking away musters up the unspoken phrase lost decades ago...  “To the Moon.”

Three words: Altria, Marijuana, Legalization (MO)
I keep an eye on Altria, owner of Phillip Morris, because I live in Richmond, their hometown and headquarters.  The Virginia legislature just legalized Marijuana for recreational use. If you aren't familiar with Virginia politics let me tell you: this is a big deal. Virginia legalizing could be the gateway for more conservative   think we could be looking at Federal legalization within the next four years, and probably sooner.   Altria bought a 45% stake in Cronos, a marijuana technology company. There are few companies I can think of that are better positioned to profit from national legalization than Altria.   ATM Calls expiring January 2022 are only   Calls expiring a year later are only a dollar more. I think if we saw an end to Federal prohibition during the next year, we could see Altria stock move up significantly. It's down 50% in the last couple years and could be poised for a big move.

Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years
Alright folks, here's the comprehensive guide about the BB products, revenue details, customers, and what's in the store in the future. It's quite a lengthy one, please bare with me as you read and this is the first time I looked up regarding a company at this depth.  Some background on the John Chen, who took up a massive challenge when he was the CEO for Sybase where the stock price was around 4-5$. But when he sold off to SAP it was around 65$, although it took 10 years to accomplish. He understands the business quite well and knows where to focus to generate more revenue and certainly be the best in what they do and provide the best to their customers.  # Why should companies embrace BB products?

In Q3 2020, BlackBerry UEM achieved the National Security Agency, NSA, commercial solution for classified program approval. This adds to the portfolio of US government certifications we have received for BlackBerry UEM including the NIAP-certification, the Department of Defense Information Network Approved Product List, which I think we talked about last quarter, DoDIN APL, FedRAMP and FIPS 140-2.  Context from Q3 2020 earnings call:    Recognition    As you see from multiple research firms, BB stands out in what are they doing  Ref:        # Which Markets BB has and will be targeting?

As we are noticing multiple companies in EV sector trying to launch their products.  Most of the companies would love to be part of the growing EV sector as it just the beginning excluding TESLA. They will eventually develop products/platforms for OEM's and Tier1 and provide it as a service.  As EV sector evolves more, we should see more partnerships across other companies which aren't part of BB yet might be inclined to use at least one product. As the BB product offerings are diverse and the customer success stories about how they have played a role while manufacturing their own EV products with minimal efforts can boost the marketing efforts.  Chen stated they are going after the other 6 OEM's which aren't using the Blackberry yet. Currently, BlackBerry QNX has design wins with 19 of top 25 Electric Vehicle OEMs, who together have 61% of EV market.  # How is BB coping up during the COVID?  The company expects BlackBerry QNX revenue to be negatively impacted by a slowdown in automotive market related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of which could be partially offset by increased customer demand for the Company’s endpoint security and productivity solutions that support business continuity and remote working environments, including the BlackBerry Spark platform, SecuSUITE and BlackBerry AtHoc.  # What's upcoming and where is BB focusing strategically?

There are currently   billion cars approximately.  In 2018, approximately   million heavy commercial vehicles and just over 20 million light commercial vehicles were produced throughout the world.

While it is too early for us to provide a revenue outlook, we are confident that BlackBerry IVY addresses a very large market opportunity that will greatly increase our ASP.    Cylance:    It is part of the Blackberry Spark product under UES category  Typically, Cylance subscription period is 1 to 3 yrs. based on the deal’s BB made.

BlackBerry is the only UEM vendor that has achieved this level of approval to date  . This achievement is based on the completion of cybersecurity and interoperability certifications.

Note: Software and Services include these products IoT, QNX, BlackBerry Spark, AtHoc, Radar.  The revenue got impacted due to 2020 chaos especially on the QNX product side. According to the earning calls. There are still on track to maintain the gross margin over 70% and dollar net retention rate is above 90%.  As you see, the   has been consistent past few years and revenue is steadily increasing every year.        Notes:  In 2019, due to restructuring, BB was unable to close deals, we should see +ve in 2020.  IoT: Comprised of QNX products, UEM, & Radar  Other: Handheld Devices and Service Access Fee (SAF)  Since BB was moving away from manufacturing of devices gradually, in 2020 most of it done by third party companies. That’s why we have negative growth under   Other.    # Pricing for BB products    QNX Pricing:    As there are many modules under QNX, like hypervisor, ADAS, clusters, cockpit, IVI. The cost ranges anywhere from the low-single digit dollars to literally high-single digit or low-double digit dollars per module.  Trefis estimates BlackBerry generates about $4 in QNX revenue per vehicle. Automakers are only expected to ship about 62 million new vehicles this year, according to Statista Research. Assuming QNX is installed on at least half of those vehicles, BlackBerry would generate about $120 million in annual sales -- or nearly a fifth of its trailing 12-month software and services revenue -- from QNX this year.  Link:    Unfortunately, we don't know the exact price the QNX OS costs or per say other modules under QNX. If more modules of QNX are used, then it's adds up and the Average Rate for Per Unit might be 4x or 5x.  This gives us an idea about how to get more revenue from QNX itself when the manufacturer would use other modules under QNX apart from OS.  We have already seen list of the OEM's from previous posts and in the above spreadsheet you saw list of the QNX products certain OEM's are using  IoT subscription period is typically 4 yrs.    Radar Pricing:    Estimation in 2017:  BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar.  The Go-to-Market objective is to have approximately a 50-50 split in Radar sales between BlackBerry’s channel partners and its direct sales force. BlackBerry Radar partners typically sell only this particular solution.  Recently, BB was able to expand channel ecosystem to more than 12 channel partners, this new partnership might help BB capture more of the logistics and transportation area.          Cylance Pricing:    Cylance might charge 55$ per endpoint per year.  Announced that Forrester found that BlackBerry Cylance’s AI-driven endpoint security products delivered a 99 percent return on investment. We will see more revenue in 2021 as we shared earlier that customers who bought UEM are excited about UES too.  At present, the market share is below 1%.  Ref:         Projected Product Sector Revenue Growth by 2025:      QNX:    According to survey, the Global In-Vehicle Infotainment Market size is expected to reach $  billion by 2025 (This is where we shall see more competition from different OEM manufacturers as they build their own products)  Global Market Insights, Inc. has recently added a new report on automotive operating system market which estimates the global market valuation for automotive OS will cross US$   billion by 2026  And the QNX OS (Just the OS) segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 15% from 2020 to 2026       Endpoint Protection (Cylance):    The global endpoint security market is expected to grow from   billion $ in 2020 to   billion $ in 2025 at a CAGR of   during the forecast period.   .  Assuming the market share in endpoint increases to \~3%. It can be around 577 million    Asset Management (Radar):    Global asset tracking market will reach $  by 2025, growing at 15% CAGR     We have to know what the priority level for BB for this product and how much market share they are targeting in the upcoming years. It’s quite early to say about it and the contribution to the revenue is insignificant compared to other products.    Challenges:    QNX:  Toyota, VW, Mercedes Benz have started taking route of AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) which is an open source (free to use) which implies the QNX market share in OS is waning. These are big manufacturers and how blackberry shall adapt is wait and see game.  There is always a case where companies might decide not to use more of the QNX modules just the OS, this will impact the Average Selling Price (ASP) per car as well as the revenue since those modules add up 4x-5x ASP.  IVY:  Revenue from Blackberry IVY shall be more reflective from 2023, stated by Chen. So, there is uncertainty in this area and no revenue estimate. We have to see how this partnership plays out how companies are willing to adopt cloud platform for insights and management of the automotive software’s.  Cylance:  Currently, the market is highly competitive, and BB has to make it way to top 10 and capture more market share. In 2021, it shall unfold more about it as we are seeing rapid growth in IoT sector across various sectors.  The BB is in the right position to capture more of the automotive market and we have to see how it shall play out in coming years when EV sector is full blown and more cars are delivered, and security threats increase. Also, it offers the endpoint protection, which certainly companies can benefit but not necessarily the SMB which are driven through e-commerce platforms.  Radar:  It’s barely scratching the surface in this sector and as there are bigger sharks who have been in the market for long time.  In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company previously stated that it expected to generate $100 million in cumulative revenue from its BlackBerry Radar asset tracking solution over the next three years. The Company no longer expects to generate this revenue within this time frame. (This is a set back and there are other competitors who have been in the Logistics and Transportation Industry for quite some time).  In general, BB has to pitch itself more aggressively in other sectors especially in Medical, Industrial, Oil and Energy. Considering the certifications they have and the clients they serve.  Thanks to OP's and go give a read at these DD's too:        Target Price in 2021: 25-30 (by not considering crazy valuations into account). I personally believe if the IVY platform and Spark product revenue increases then we can certainly see the stock price 4x-5x in coming years.  Positions: 400 shares @ 12 and 2 Jan 20 2023 SP 15. I plan to add more as I see the potential and growth in the newly introduced products.  Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice, I'm merely a random person who loves BB and would like to see this company fly to new heigths. Cheers to everyone!!  Edit1: thanks u/melbogia, added the date which I missed earlier for the calls.
this is what i get for having paper hands... 195 shares sold @ $54
ATT chart, everyone who uses this technique knows how great opportunity it is, my target is   9$ profit however it will take on average 3 months.
This is how I feel about the whole gme things...
I feel like the diamond hand stuff is getting  crazy, if I were able to buy stock (I am under 18 and my parents can't be fucked to make me a Robinhood account) I would have bought gme at the beginning and sold as soon as I saw the price going down call me paper hands all you want, but isn't that the smart thing to do? I was watching the stock guy on twitch the other day and something in chat resonated with me, "paper hands have paper", am I just dumb and this is actually going back up? Or is it done because just looking at the charts it looks kinda dead to me tbh.
Some Smoothbrain Real Talk for Everyone at WSB
Okay dumb-dumbs since I'm seeing the gain porn and lecturing from long time members here's a story for you all idiots that I think might help.  I've never really invested in a portfolio. My whole life I was taught two things:   keep your money in safe, steady growth locations, have have multiple locations.   So, that's what I've done. I have a savings account, a Roth IRA, a retirement fund, and as of May 2020, a portfolio. I started real small, with $1000. That money quickly grew to about $1300 and I realized that I could make smart buying decisions based on the news and my friend's (who is a CFA) advice). He convinced me to invest in some tech stonks early on as well as some other endeavors that have paid out handsomely. Not much in terms of gross $$, but from a % growth standpoint the money was huge.  Over time I started putting money that would normally go into my savings into my portfolio because, well, it was growing so much faster. I had a lot of growth off of tech stock investments, and now I have my hands in some fairly lucrative pies.   I then learned about WSB in mid-January and saw everything that was going on with GME, et. al.   I was skeptical, so I watched the market for a while. I thought 'oh hey, this could be a fun gamble, let's play ball.' I bought 10 shares of BB at $10. As it blew up I prowled the posts and saw that while GME was at $50, AMC was only at $5, and the plan to squeeze was targeted at both of them. So I bought 60 shares of AMC @ $5. A few days later, specifically, on January 29th, my money had exploded so I said okay one more small buy. I tossed in for 1 share of GME at $320, three shares of KO$$ at 69.   One hour later RH restricted buying.    I guess I should've just dumped everything right there but I loved the camaraderie that I saw here. Obviously, I knew that a reddit sub wasn't about to take down any major hedge funds, but I did see an opportunity to expose these assholes like in 2008. So I held. Then when GME started to fall, I bought another 4 shares at $85, and I tossed my remaining balance on AMC. Everything together we're looking at about $1,500 put toward this effort.  Obviously, the outlook isn't a whole lot better today than it was this time last week. And yet, I'm holding. Why? Why would I hold after admitting I made an objectively stupid series of buys? Answer: Because I can afford to, and because I like to gamble. It's fun to me. I'm not rich by any measure, but I'm smart enough to understand that this is a group of RETARDS who know very little about finances. So I wanted to have fun with it, and I decided to invest about 10% of my portfolio into this mess. That said, my portfolio only makes up about 10% of my total net worth, if even that much.   So, at best, I've invested 1% of my net worth into this "movement."    The moral of my story should be clear:  # You're all idiots. I'm an idiot. This is DUMB.  But it's also fun. And you know what? If you put 80% of your life savings into buying GME at $350, you're a fucking dumbass. That is not, and has never been how money works.   These guys posting loss and gain porn on this site? There's what, two dozen of them? Out of 8,500,000?!   Come on, stop. You think you're going to outsmart a series of billionaires just because some guy who bought 50,000 shares of a dead stock in July said it might work one of these days? Stop it, get some help.  And to the "OG members" who think that they are just so smart for manipulating the market at a FRACTION of the efficiency, stealth, and organization that hedge fund operators do it EVERY DAY, I say you can lick my nutsack from the back. Cool, a couple hundred people got lucky and ya caught Melvin off guard for a week. But honestly, shame on you assholes for screaming "HOLD HOLD HOLD" when GME was tanking from 400 all the way down to 120.   People were watching their lives disintegrate because of a damn joke that they weren't in on from the gate.   Guess what, you're Melvin now. You fucked the little guy and got rich doing it. How's it feel?    TLDR:   I'm holding forever because I like the stock, but if this is ruining your life, get out now. It's only going to get worse. Also, WSB is Melvin down, sit in that shit.
Just being humble and asking for some help
Hey there WSB, I’m not going to pretend I know anything of anything on here. I’m pretty young just about 20. I’ve been getting some good income in the past couple weeks ( $500 a week which is a lot for me ). I live with my family and don’t really have any bills to pay. I know you guys have no obligation to give me any advice at all, but I really want to put a lot of money and time into the stock market and hopefully start to gain a good income and get out of my current family situation. I’m not asking on how to make millions overnight I know it takes time, if at all. Overall I’m just seeking some advice and help maybe even some stocks you think would be a good move? Sorry if this goes against guidelines I’m not very sure but I’m just trying to put in some more extra effort to have a nicer life. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you :)
What are the Risk Departments doing right now?
The recent run-up of GME from $4 -> $500 caught a bunch of people with their pants down, such as hedge funds, brokers, and market makers. The entire world was watching and NOBODY wants to be exposed to this type of event again.  I'm losing hope that this type of thing will happen again in the next 10 years.    TL;DR - Why this won't happen again    1. Every financial institution is now aware of this type of risk 2. They have every analyst working to mitigate this in the future 3. They are learning how to break the rules better  # What are the Risk departments doing right now?    Background:   I was a Data Scientist in the Risk/Underwriting department of a finance company for 3 years (not on wallstreet, just a B2C company for small consumer loans).       1. They are getting their ass handed to them.    Risk teams hate attention because it's always bad. This is their worst nightmare.  The CEO is asking why the fuck they didn't see this coming and warn them. And why a bunch of literally retarded autists on reddit knew about this before they did.    2. They are dedicating 100% of their resources to making sure they see this type of thing coming.    Every Analyst up to the PhD jerkoffs that thought they were going to be playing with deep neural networks are instead currently spending all of their time running queries and making plots in excel for every "what-if" scenario that the executives can think of.  They may have gotten fucked last month, but now they have TONS of data to train models and run scenarios with. They are going to be ready next time.    3. They are learning what rules they can break.    Things like Failure-to-Deliver and limiting buys on certain securities are now additional levers that they are learning how to pull and are currently building models for. They don't give a fuck if something is "illegal" or "unethical". Instead they have a simpler function to guide their decisions:  `E(Revenue) = E(Gains from doing illegal shit) - E(Legal fees and costs)`  If they make more money doing illegal shit than it costs, then they do it.          Note:   I'm probably completely wrong and Hedge funds still might be exposed. Idk because I'm retarded and bought GME at $300 and never sold.
110%+ institutional ownership or 110%+ short interest is NOT anything shady. What it is is incredibly bullish!
People were shocked to hear "over 100% of GME shares have been shorted" or "institutions own over 100% of GME shares."    "How is that possible?"    It's actually quite simple, and nothing shady. All it shows is that the short interest is MASSIVELY overexposed, which makes them incredibly vulnerable as I'll outline below.  Here's the simple case:  Andy owns a share in a margin account. Andy's broker loans his share to Barry, who sells it. Andy sees the stock for sale, says "I like this stock and that's a fair price" and he buys the stock from Barry. (Andy doesn't know he's buying his own share, but it doesn't really matter.) Now Andy owns two shares and Barry is short one. Again, Barry borrows the share from Andy's broker, sells it, and Andy buys it again. Now Andy has 3 shares, and Barry is short 2. So compared to the original quantity, Andy holds 300% and Barry is short 200%!  These numbers are, for the purposes of the market, "real" shares. (This doesn't involve any counterfeiting or naked shorts at all.) If Charlie comes in offering a baller price, Andy can sell his three shares. That  may  cause the broker to recall the short shares from Barry, forcing Barry to now buy two shares at market price to cover.       "But don't shares let you vote in a stockholder meeting? How can one person vote three times with the same share?"    They can't - it's important to understand that  you are generally forfeiting your voting rights on any share you hold in a margin account.  Shares that have been lent have no voting rights. The voting right belongs to whoever has bought a share and has  not  loaned it out. When you hold shares in a margin account, it may be loaned (you wouldn't know if it has or has not) and if it has been loaned you are not the holder of record.     So in my example above, even though Andy has three shares, he has a maximum of one vote because he only owns one un-loaned share.    "This is getting boring, how does all this get me tendies?"    NOW you're asking the right fucking question! The brokers can  only  lend out shares that are in margin accounts (often brokerage accounts may have margin enabled). They  cannot  lend out shares that are in cash accounts or accounts w/o margin (at least not without your express permission.) So if we move our shares out of margin/brokerage accounts and into cash accounts, the brokers will run low on shares to lend.  At first, if just a small number of us move to cash accounts, the effect will be subtle (but still meaningful): as the broker runs low on shares to lend, the interest rate they charge to the shorts will increase. This puts pressure on the shorts to close sooner, since their nightly interest payment increases and so they have more incentive to close their position sooner.  Now, if we ALL do this, the effect increases nonlinearly: WE COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE ANOTHER SQUEEZE. Once your broker runs out of unlent shares (which is quite likely since the short interest is so high), if you transfer your stocks from your brokerage account to a cash account, your broker will need to recall those shares, forcing the shorts to buy! And that becomes a double-whammy to all other shorts: (1) the more shorts are forced to buy by the brokers, the higher the price goes, and (2) the lower the supply of shares available to loan is, the higher the interest rate goes. The interest payment is due nightly and is based on \[current stock price\]x\[current interest price\] and this strategy drives both factors higher, ballooning the interest payment, which pressures more shorts to close... which drives the price up more, which further pressures shorts to close...   a squeeze.  (I think in the past week the brokers already did run out of shares to lend, but I can't find the citation, please post in the comments if you have intel about shares available for loan or interest %s.)    "Wait, isn't this the exact strategy that Mark Cuban told us we should use if we want a squeeze?"    Yes, specifically his words were  "Now if #WSB did this en masse, it would be the mother of all short squeezes."        "Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?"    Yes.  1. Open a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account. 2. Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it. 3. If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high). 4. Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.  edit: u/rozhasi says "Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can’t lend your shares to short sellers."  edit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though  new  Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.)  If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into, please post in the comments and I will try and add a how-to here.   edit3: from u/A1pha101:  for all you Nords, Nordnet Investing Account Zero has share lending   on by default  , but there is a form you can fill out to disable it. I can't vet the link they sent to the form (it's in Norwegian hosted on   . If a critical mass can link to the form and vouch it's legit I will edit it in here.    tl;dr:       (in cash accounts,   NOT   in brokerage/margin accounts)   This is not financial advice, talk to a professional if you want advice.
Do you just hate money or what ? (CRSR earnings play)
Hello ladies and gentlemen,  I know with the GME / AMC situation, both cocks and spirits are down right now. But hey, it's not about marrying a stock right ? It's about making money. So as we optimistically wait for that situation to resolve, I have a proposition. Call it a "meta" DD. I'll keep it short.  For the past 2 months, more knowledgeable people than me in this sub have been pleading, literally begging y'all to get in on the CRSR earnings play, coming up shortly. Here is a compiled list of some posts made by people with big cocks -                           Now let me make it simpler for you retards, here is a link that will show you all posts about CRSR in the last month, sorted by "Top". Go do your own reading -      Now here is the deal, this is the list of people who know CRSR is going to go absolute apeshit in earnings -   1. Everyone. 2. Their garderners. 3. Their grandmothers. 4. Their wife's boyfriend.  Now a lot of those posts are pussies who're buying stock (which is a weird phenomena I've noticed recently, all of a sudden all DD and YOLOs are people being stock, whatever happened to OTM weeklies lol - that was the shit I'm here for), but if you're not putting at least a 1000 or two into    40c 2/19,    or if you're truly retarded like me, which I'm guessing you are,   60c 2/19, hell yeah,   then what are you even doing ?   Do you just hate money or what ?     tl ; dr    CRSR's is gonna murder earnings.   Safe play for the pussies -   40c 2/19 CRSR    Retarded play for people like me -   60c 2/19 CRSR    Make your own mind up.
Overview of Current GME Situation: It's Just Getting Started
Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to dictate or advise your trading decisions. I don't know jack shit about fuck. This is not financial advice. This analysis is not meant to influence, inspire, or inform you regarding your trades. This analysis was written purely as speculation and could be entirely incorrect. I found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion. Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock’s activity. I own shares of GME.     TLDR:   This is currently a war between funds. Your   shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.  Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds.      The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own   of the shares. The   of Shares Held by Institutions is displayed here is old data, and the current number is closer to  . The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.   GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less.   Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ:    Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest   DAILY   on that stock at the   CURRENT PRICE  . If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make.   Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ:    As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the "squeeze."  So the short interest goes from   to   and the price went from $  to $     Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.   I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered:      But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:      Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.    Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($  Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media   against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. "The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron."  So what's the current situation?  1)   Team A Hedge Funds:   These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy the stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.  2)   Team B Hedge Funds:   These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently "low" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).  3)   Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:   These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B.   What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a retard like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to "cover," but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.    And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.    The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.  This is not financial advice. I am not telling you to hold. However, you have already paid for your ticket to this show, think about maybe sticking around for the ending.
You Think This Week Has Been Long? You're Weak Minded, That Can Be Changed But Only Through Experience
IMPORTANT EDIT   Nearly of the positive comments recieved on this post are being shadowbanned. I AM SEEING THEM so thank you for all the support. Even if the mods dont want the world to know what you said I saw it. Now on to the original post...   Hello Paper Hands,  I see your posts about how you can't hold out any longer. I'm not here to tell you what to do, only to share a personal story.  I invested heavily into low and mid range Jameis Winston rookie cards shortly after he was cut from the Buccs. Retarded right? Most people thought so and card shop owners audibly laughed at my requests for them. I had them trading me Prizm Winston cards for Low End Daniel Jones and Drew Lock rookies before the 2020 season began. Then he signed with the Saints and his card value had a small jump... I could have had paper hands and took my profit then and there, but I believed the value was higher than that, I LIKED THE STOCK then as much as I do now, so I held.  Cut forward to midseason 2020, Brees goes down and Winston is not named the starter. Do I panic? No, because I trust what I see, Winston is a better QB than Taysom Hill.  Cut forward again to the NFC Playoffs, cameras catch Brees telling Winston "This is your team now." His price starts to climb, but hesitently as nothing is yet official. I know the Saints are not going to draft a starting QB this year, and they are in no financial situation to make a play for one on the market. So I hold, because I know the value will be higher when he is offically named the starter and the 2021 season starts.  That's 2 years of holding. Not even a scratch on these DIAMOND HANDS.   I can honestly say the most difficult hold of all was the first one, when he signed to the Saints. The chance to get out with a small profit was tempting. Although I knew it would be a long hold, once I made the decision there was no turning back, I knew the regret of knowing I was right and went against my gut was a longer hold. I'm still holding those rookie cards btw, gonna be for atleast a little while longer.    Right up until I believe he's hit peak value... Then I'll cash in, and take your wife out somewhere nice for a change.
Margin Rates are Negotiable
Based on how much ya'll like to YOLO, I assume many of you are trading on margin. Please know that margin rates aren't set in stone and are negotiable. I use TD as my brokerage. Last week I messaged them saying that I have offers from other brokerages at lower rates and asked what they could do. They lowered my rate by 2%. I wrote them back asking for even lower (we'll see what they say).  This will save all you diamond handed Apes some money while you hold.   Let me know about any success stories!
Slightly old info but Majority holders of GME are HF - RC 100% YOLO ?lol
GIVE EM A COOKIE!

There is a social media manipulation   going on surrounding certain commodities
I've been following the Gamestop trend on here for the past couple of weeks and, much like other people, have started to notice a lot of strange posts about silver.  Digging into some of the account histories of those promoting silver, we find some interesting things:    - a 3 year old account with 1 month of posting history, oldest visible post on a trading subreddit.   .    - 10 month old account which mainly posted about MMA until 3 days ago, since then only posts have been about silver.    - year old account with sporadic posting   3 days ago when they started posting about silver.    about silver.  Realistically, it would probably cost around $1500 to give that many awards to that post. $1500 is pocket change to firms like Citron which hold a big stake in silver.    - 3 year old account, just became active again after about a year.  The list goes on from that obviously.  A good chunk of those accounts appear to be purchased accounts. The tell-tale sign is a huge gap in post history and way off topic posting. Anyone with a couple thousand dollars lying around could do it. For huge firms which already held millions of dollars in silver/silver securities, it's like pissing into the ocean.   I just want everyone to be aware of what's happening.
The Emotionally Intelligent Investor
All I'm trying to tell you people  is you get laid if you said   "Babes it was a crazy day, but i was emotional intelligent and held. "  Emotional Intelligence challenges several long-held assumptions and beliefs, by asserting that a good investment approach starts with introspection. Too many investment gurus tell you to emulate their techniques despite the fact that you may have very different personality traits, motivations and biases. Would Zion Williams tell a short basketball player to play like him? Investors need to create a unique template for self-reflection and a framework for developing an investment approach that works best with who you are. Whereas the consensus opinion is that investing success comes from blocking out emotions and making purely rational decisions, the best money managers actually use their feelings. They actively sense what others in the market are thinking, and they employ gut instincts when making decisions. Nevertheless, virtually all investing text books neglect to mention how to best cultivate and utilize empathetic and intuitive realizations. By creating your own investment template, you will develop an investing advantage by putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. You will also discover how a stock chart is a great tool for understanding what the current holders of a security may be feeling, and you will appreciate why technical analysis works. Superior returns primarily depend on self-awareness, empathy and intuition.

How it feels to be a GME holder
Looks like GME gain porn is allowed now. Put 2k in, got 12k back with some leftover shares in case something crazy happens. I count that as an absolute win.
Create the New Wall Street
Listen up DUMMIES, this might be the last time I bother with you retards,  may I'll just sit and watch, ride the waves you create for me and cash out like a smart person next time.   YOU ARE CREATING THE NEW WALL STREET.   There are millions of you and the number is growing. There are ONLY A FEW OF THEM.  Some of you are holding and don't know what to do, some of you have given up, and far too many of you shitebags are chickening out like pussies, some of you want to make sensible financial decisions and gamble on stock.  You do not want to play gambling at Stock. THAT IS THEIR GAME. That is what Wall Street have always done at the DETRIMENT OF EVERYBODY ELSE. In gambling in casinos, the house always wins. Why the fuck would you want play that game in that house? When you have enough resources between you all to open your own house and close that one for good.  Playing at Stock is an OLD PERSONS GAME. You are YOUNG, You create the NEW GAME.  Of course they say you can't do this or that. No gouging, no hair pulling, no biting. Coz they don't want to lose. They tell you this is a fair game. It was never a fair game. They cheated to bring you down, they cheat to keep you down. Some of you sadomasochistic bum joys actually look like you're enjoying it. Big fucking stupid smiles on your faces "look at my loss porn, my wife is divorcing me, YOLO"  GET A GRIP THIS IS NOT A GAME. BE IN IT TO WIN IT OR SUCK A GAY BEARS DICK.   MY AIM IS TO WIN, YOU ARE ALL INVITED.  I hold no stock I put no money on this, do not mistake me for a follower like any of you. I do not do this for my own gain. I provide wisdom for you. Look at my METHOD, you can ask me your questions but do not tell me it is impossible or I am stupid or I will sit back and watch you lose with a smile on face saying I told you so...  Nothing is impossible, YOU HAVE ALREADY ACHIEVED WHAT OTHERS ONCE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE.   What has brought success in the past, you must be willing to let go of. This is Success 101. It may have served you well but if it is old and it no longer serves you let it go. Try a new idea.   Wall Street is pretty fucking old right now, you guys have the power to bury it and create your own. WHY DO NONE OF YOU SEEM TO SEE THAT, WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARE SCARED?   You call yourself Retards, I am starting to believe it.   That is ALL
Posting my gain porn for all the retards out there! Had to repost because I forgot to edit out my account number (proof I am also a retard) bought the dips and sold the blips over the past 2 years.
Gains were made, but the bag was dropped. I fell into the GME  🏼  cult and let her slip right out of my hands. Lucky I got in early enough to secure like 40k
Can we please see a repeat of 2 weeks ago?!?!
all of us right now:
Would like to write about my experience with the GameStop run up, and what I learned about life out of it
Hey guys.   I made a post roughly 60 days ago about a 30k “YOLO” on GME. I purchased the 25c 4/16 with roughly 77 contracts. My cost basis was about 5 dollars a contract since I bought before earnings. I diamond handed them through the rough days where we saw GME drop heavy after earnings.  Two nights before GME took off, I sold my position. I keep going back, and I keep asking myself. Why? Why did I sell? I was so confident this would play out. I Fucking went all in and sat on my position through all of the ups and downs. Truth is, I don’t know why I sold. I believe I was bored, and just wanted to trade something. I couldn’t stand not trading.   When the run up began, I felt sick. I threw up, and my body wouldn’t stop shaking. Life changing money for me. I kept checking the value of the contracts that I had, every 15 minutes and counting all the money I would’ve had if I didn’t throw my contracts away.  I began shaking and crying. Hating myself for being such a paper handed bitch. So I went all in again on a GME weekly. I watched that weekly call double my original position, and then eventually ride to 0. That’s right.   I blew up my account. I’ve only been trading options for less than a year but at the top of GMEs run my position would’ve been roughly 4mil.    I’ve gone from 20k -> 60k -> 3k -> 20k -> 36k -> 0  Everyone including friends and family keep asking if I’ve heard about GME. Yeah bitch, I heard about it. It hurts to talk about. I tell my story, and they all tell me how sorry they feel for me when I tell them I could’ve been a multi millionaire.  Do you want to know why I don’t have millions right now? Because of these mother fucking paper hands.   As I watch you retards gamble your life savings at the top of GME, diamond handing it to the bottom, I can’t help but to think that you guys are fucking retarded.   You’re all retarded but you’re like me. You belong here, and I certainly belong here.   As we speak, I’m pulling funds out of the retirement account and going back at it.   Why? Is it because I’m a Retard? Maybe. But I’m a Retard with a dream, and that can be scary thing and I realize that.  Godspeed to you all.      Loss Porn

PSA: Beware of WallStreetBets Pumps & other similar groups on discord
If you're in the WSB discord, you may get an invitation from rando(s) to this group called "WallStreetBets Pumps" ran by a guy named "Cr\ ptic Joe". Now obvious red flag/warning signs should pop up right away. The whole channel was restricted (you can't react or post messages) so it was a one-man show basically.  Now I figured he'd be trying to do this on some no-name low mkt cap alts, and sure enough it was one. Self-sabotaging curious, I threw in a fun $100 worth of BT\  to actually see my suspicions play out. Sure enough, the moment he posted the ticker, and I market bought in, that hundred bucks was   cut in half almost instantaneously  \--ROFL. I can't even call this a pump: the candlestick is just one giant gravestone doji, how fitting. I know a bunch of you degens (and majority of the population really) don't know jack shit about cr\ pto, and may be lured in by some "get rich quick" scheme (as proven by the fact Doggy is a fuckin' nickel), so thought I should give y'all a heads up.  Warning sent. My good deed of the day, done.    Seems like these pump groups are popping up by more con artists as I just got another invite. Do yourself a favor and turn off DM from people in the WSB discord group cuz that's how they find you.    There are current 10,584 people online in this group, and increasing. Yeah, no joke. Be careful.
Gains     This is silly because it’s only 12 shares. Thank you Michael Saylor for your insane bet. Over a billion in 4 months on the balance sheet. And I’m an idiot for selling 30 shares for $600 profit.  🏼‍♂️
Pot Stocks - Are You High?
So a bunch of you got in these last 2 weeks and are googling “How do I make my money back?”, “Plasma donation centers near me”, “Life insurance suspicious circumstance non-payout”, etc. But before you’re humiliated in a viral dashcam video flinging yourself onto the hood of a Kia Sportage you’re going to try stocks one more time. After all, you still have an account balance. Sure, you could buy a fractional share of $ISRG for $80 and wait 5 years for your 68% return but frankly you just don’t like how .1049 shares looks in your portfolio and you need to make that money back before the 1 month introductory 0% interest on your new Surge Mastercard with personalized diamond hands printed on the front.        Rack your brain. What’s going to be a huge industry in the coming years that you can get in on the ground floor? Something you can buy a bunch of shares in? Why not smoke some weed to help you think? Great Scott. Of course. The solution is right there in front of you, sandwiched between a sweating Jack In The Box cup and a broken iPad used to roll joints on. You’ll invest in weed stocks. Everyone likes weed and Joe Biden is going to legalize it soon! Look at that, you can buy weed stocks for CHEAP! $SNDL is barely more than a dollar share. With $80 you’re practically a majority shareholder!  You couldn’t be more wrong.  I could throw a bunch of complicated DD at you right now with charts and acronyms so we could both pretend we’re smart. But it really isn’t complicated. If weed stocks are going to surge due to legalization then someone explain why when weed is legalized in certain states the price of an ounce can plummet to $60? You’re talking about a commodity literally ANYONE can grow in their home. It’s as if climate scientists expect that rain will turn to beer within the month and you say “I’ll invest in Budweiser!”        I can feel you getting defensive and I understand. Won’t some company end up being the biggest out of them all and worth a lot of money? What about peripheral industries like Akerna? Wait, Screech died? When?  Over-saturation is going to be the biggest thing with legalized weed (See: $60 ounce). Supply side will be local or at largest, regional. If I’m in Seattle why am I ordering weed and paying shipping costs from North Carolina? Or even worse getting it from Canada with all the international trade headaches? There is literally nothing they can offer me that can’t be grown or produced locally. Nor is this like the wine industry where climate conditions can influence the product. I can grow this anywhere. Which also means there is still a massive black market for weed.  When I say black market I don’t mean guys with face scars meeting in empty airplane hangars to make deals. I mean your friend decided to throw some seeds in the ground, forgot about them and now has 4 pounds of weed he needs to get rid of. Being from a legal state I cannot tell you how much free weed I get from friends. It’s like when you think you’re cooking a reasonable amount of spaghetti and next thing you know you’re the gluttony scene in “Se7en”.        So what about peripheral businesses surrounding pot? I’ve seen a lot of talk about Akerna ($KERN) on here. Mostly people saying they’re the “only business of their kind in an emerging market”, etc. So have a look at their description on the website:  >Akerna consolidates cannabis technology companies to connect data points in the global cannabis supply chain. In doing so, Akerna creates one of the world’s most transparent and accountable consumer packaged goods supply chains on a global scale. We believe connected data and information will modernize and propel the cannabis industry by increasing the power of businesses, governments, patients, and consumers to make smart decisions.  This reads like an essay with a minimum word count.  Just because something is the only business of its kind isn’t a good reason it will succeed. Go find the cardboard box the guy who invented toe socks lives in and he’ll tell you. If my supply side is mostly local what the fuck am I going to do with the information Akerna provides? They are a cannabis software company. A cannabis software company. Keep saying it. A cannabis software company.   You know when you go to the grocery store and they put Spiderman on a box of Duraflame Starter Logs and now your dipshit kid is screaming and crying for you to buy Duraflame Starter Logs because he saw Spiderman? People are staring at you, judging your terrible parenting and just to get out of the situation you pay $  for the logs even though you don’t have a fireplace. The term “cannabis” is the Spiderman sticker and you are the dipshit kid.        And yeah, Screech died on February 1st so if you want to pay your respects then bust a couple nuts to his sex tape. This absolutely is financial advice.
Help me understand AMC
So in the 8-k filed on January 25th, AMC said the Silverlake would get 44 million shares from converting their senior note.  Silverlake dumped those 44 million shares between $13 to $16/  move for them bad for AMC shares holders.  In that 8k AMC also said they would issue 50 million new shares, to be sold ...whenever. I'm seeing reports that they sold at least some of them in the $10+ range.  So the question i have is two fold:  1. I see all these people posting short interest   do they actually know if AMC can randomly sell new shares?  2. Why are people bullish on AMC with all of the dilution? They have sold new shares multiple times since October.  The price should be less than $2 if you just look at dilution.  Edit: love all of the thoughtful answers. Not sure why so many downvoted for asking questions.
Would Everyone Please Shut Up About Short Squeezes
The only reason GME worked is because of Dr. Burry and Ryan Cohen. Praise be to DFV for hipping this sub to the play that was already in place.   You guys can’t short squeeze shit. Stop talking about the next short squeeze or gamma play. Half of you fucks don’t know the difference between delta and gamma or the market mechanics necessary for a squeeze.   I have read probably 10 “explanations” on here of what happened with GME that were just plain ridiculous and completely wrong.   Please go back to posting memes. Thank you that is all.
Anyone else bought in GME at 600% IV and staying ape strong? Somebody hold me and GME.  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
How I think AMC is not worth $1
I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.   Hi everyone, hope you're having a peaceful Saturday. The Super Bowl is coming up, so I hope you guys in America enjoy it.  This post is for AMC, as this is what I've been playing close attention to. After doing some of my own research, I've concluded that AMC isn't worth $1 as many analysts have mentioned in their analysis, and I think it should be much higher. It all comes down to the fundamentals of the film industry.  How film studios and distributors make money is primarily based on theatre attendances. Usually, a portion of profits made from theatre tickets goes to theatre owners. The majority of the rest goes to the studio and distributor. The amount is organised through a contract between the exhibitor and the studio before the film is aired; usually, it's a 60/40 split, with 60% of the ticket revenue going to the studio. You can read more about how movies make money here:    As long as this fundamental is in place, the film studios and distributors will keep airing their films in theatres and cinemas. Although streaming services are the future of entertainment, they won't be able to replicate the same big-screen experience that many do enjoy. Furthermore, they won't provide the same profit margins for film studios as a regular theatre would do. It all boils down to the streaming service business model.  A prime example of this is when Disney aired the live-action film Mulan on Disney+. You had to pay the $30 early-access fee on top of the regular $  per month subscription to get into Disney+. Logically, there was a big backlash behind this move, with many calling it a "daylight robbery". This defeats the purpose of a streaming subscription business model; the whole point is that you pay a small fee per month to gain access to a large amount of content. Having a rental that costs more than a regular rental and even more than a regular ticket, is counterintuitive to the business model.  Now take the fundamentals of the film industry into account, and it doesn't add up. If the streaming platform sets a $20-30 fee on a film, no one pays to watch it. If they set no fees at all, then the film studio won't make their money back.  So, as long as this fundamental is in place, AMC will continue making money in the future. AMC has set up private theatre rentals, screening old classics and airing new films from 2021 into 2022. And as long as big film studios advertise people to watch their movies in theatres, AMC will go on.  Now that bankruptcy is off the table, and vaccinations are   up, we'll slowly return to normal. I can see the stock being back to $10-20 again.    TL;DR:   As long as film studios advertise to go to the theatres, AMC won't go anywhere.   Again, I'm not a financial advisor; I'm just a regular investor who likes stocks. Do your due diligence before purchasing stock, and make sure you invest what you can afford to throw away without feeling guilty about it.   Thanks for reading.    Edit:   u/ActuaryExpert8729 commented on something that adds more to the argument that AMC will do fine. The COVID-19 Relief Package signed in December 2020 sets aside $15 billion of financial support to movie theatres and live event venues. There's probably a fund for film studios as well. Films are already moving up ahead of schedule, with Godzilla vs Kong moved from May 21st to March 26th.

A lesson on losing more than you can afford
Look at this guy.   I understand a lot of you bought in the hype and are brand new to this.   Wallstreet bets is not a fucking movement. We aren’t a hive mind. We aren’t a get rich quick scheme. We are dudes with the mindset Valhalla or breadlines. Please please please do not get into these plays with money you can’t afford to lose. And if you did don’t kill yourself. Don’t be the fucking guy who reached out to me.

Do they mean "retards" or "autists"?
A better GME story...
Advice to $GME information seekers who are skeptical and want the truth
Hey everyone,  So the price definitely went down. This sucks if you are long. But remember how dejected the hopefuls were after $GME’s q3 fiasco? Not investment advice but use the current levels of palpable  despair to plan your next course of action.   It’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s fake right now.   What do I recommend? Follow comment and post history of the OGs who have been here since day 1 and have surprisingly balanced takes on this whole thing.   Some ideas:  U/jeffamazon (on Twitter too) U/cpthubbard (on Twitter too) U/fataspirations  If I slightly misspelled one of these names it will be immediately clear. All have extensive post and comment history on relevant topics.

Sick and tired
Who here is sick and tired of all the idiotic Gme/amc/ape posts?  Who here wants the 8mm noobs that just joined to fuck off and go back to where they came from.  Who here wishes these 15-18 year old idiots who post $500/$1000/$1500/$2000 positions would just go fuck off and be poors on r/babystreetbets.  Who here wishes that there where good mods on this sub that are now gone bc of the influx of children on this sub.  This sub has been dog dick after 700,000k followers.  Now the 15-18 year old snowflake libtards took away the word that describes you watching your wife get fucked by her bf while you beat it.  Next up, retard will soon be gone and we can thank the bullshit woke culture that is the most entitled generation I’ve ever seen.  Things I love, all the discord and YouTube videos of people advising people and promoting stonks without proper authorization about to be shut down bc retards don’t get you can’t coordinate with one another unless you own the market.  When did this ape and banana thing even become funny and cool? These phrases were never even used before 15 year olds, with $10 in their bank accounts, came here.  Downvote, don’t care, don’t be salty you bought gme over $450 and then try to pump it more to get ur loss back, it ain’t happening, ffs just stop.  TL:DR I fucking hate poors and children, I love Tesla though.  Edit: the amount of shill comments being removed is absolutely fucking hilarious. So much gen z cancer woke snowflake libtard entitled culture comments being removed and not being shown is so funny. To bad you aren’t in the requirements to comment, bitch!

Is commission free trading dead?
Hey guys,   I tried to buy some penny stocks today on E-Trade and for 5$ worth of stocks they wanted to charge me a 5$ commission. This seems new to me as I've been using them for several months and they've never charged such a high commission. Is anyone experiencing this with E-Trade and other platforms today that were previously commission free? Is this their response to the volatility? Is it just them punishing me for buying and holding AMC? WTF is going on. I'm a n00b. Please advise.
Two different time eras
Yolo! Am I doing this right?
GME is too high imo
What the SI Report told us: Two weeks ago the hegies were down ~50% SI on a poisoned stock.
wtf makes you think that they haven't had a chance to cover their butts? Remember a week ago when the price held just under $100 all day? That was big repositioning day for the hegies. Also, and this is important, the hedge funds are not  required  to buy shares to get out of the short positions... not tomorrow, not ever.  But, for argument's sake, lets say that they are still (a week and a half later) shorted by \~80%. Is it reasonable to assume that they don't have a plan? Can you imagine how many apologies would need to be in the letter to their investors if they let Reddit run them twice in the same quarter, on the same stock, in the same way? That would banko a fund faster than any gamma squeeze could.     Get your head in the game.     Also, it should be noted that the GME play is not and never was a war with the institutions and if it is, small stacks are going to lose, not big stacks. God bless, 'Murica.
My Fav stock's and why!!
BE AWARE, tried to make a fun post, getting downvoted by shorties.  Blackberry.... On the Cheap side and heavily undervalued. Lots of  potential in the EV sector and cybersecurity sector.

Not Cool buy some weed...stoncks and chill. the shorties below are furious.
My official statement regarding Reddit
Boring but useful information for new traders hopping into options
I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January.  First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox.  Ranking if you do not want to read the full review.  1. FlowAlgo  2. TitanFlow  3. Cheddar Flow  4. OptionsFlow   Apps  TitanFlow  Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50  TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts.  Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page.  Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page.  Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow.  Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop.  Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added.  OptionsFlow  Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20  This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts.  Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus.  Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it’s better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says "there is no options flow today" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data.  Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review.  Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though.  Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them.  Websites  FlowAlgo  Cost Per Month: $150  I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market.   Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of.  CheddarFlow  Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99  If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow’s main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic.  Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends.  I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data. Hope this helps.
Primates of the Caribbean: At Short's Squeeze (A work of complete fiction)
I am $LGND
$LGND DD  I seen on the box, the bird, and the printz  that LGND was part of the WSB squeeze however other then a few post that seemed largely exaggerated. Even if it’s an industry plant it seems like a good play, maybe even a a lay up for a short term grab. Probably some value in a long term play also.   The play  LGND has been buying back shares for the last 3 years. Reducing total shares from 21 mil to 16 mil. Average price paid per share on the buyback was $105. The shorts are already 62% of the float which is second to GME.  However, it appears that as much 9 mil shares are owned by insiders. 5 mil shares are actually owned by Investment 10 llc since 2014. Investment 10 appears to not be very active with only a handful of sec fillings mostly signed by a management fund. This LLC being largely inactive, I believe suggests that it belongs to one of the head insiders. This is big because 30% of the float is likely owned by someone who rarely trades shares- by their filings. The 5 mil plus the other insiders is near 9 mil insider ownership.   16 mil float - 9 mil insider shares= 7 million available    M shorted (62% of 16 mil) 21 days to cover   Average volume 1 mil shares    Catalyst  LGND beat earnings and shares jumped up $22 dollars on Friday— the risk of a squeeze is more and more likely with any significant push in volume.    Owners  -Goldman Sachs 12% shares bonds and options (form 3) -John Higgins CEO (240k) Mathew Foehr  -Charles Berkman, JD (28k) Formerly Lyon  ; Lyon from 1993 to 2000, where he specialized in intellectual property law -Mathew Korenberg cfo (40k) Former Goldman Sachs alleged but not charged in connection Raj Rajaratnam  Blackrock 13% William Blair 12%  Background info  If hedgies ran a pharmacy. Ligand began as a biopharmaceutical company and failed then reinvented itself as a pharmacy  investment bank and also happens to be run - to some degree by investment bankers. The company acquires early-stage drug technology, and then licenses it in a tiered royalty fee. Some of it clients uses it license while creating more early stage drug technology. Perpetual motion, I guess. For instance it’s licensing agreement some companies are not even yet profitable such as Seelos- a penny stock with 50% insider ownership that has jumped $  in the last month despite recent dilution in same month and large debt- is for a mid stage parkisons treatment.  -over $700 million in cash, Ligand is position to acquire more drugs. -Captisol sales were $41 million compared with $  million a year ago.  -Captisol is used Veklury (remdesivir), which is approved for treating severe COVID-19 patients   Something about this all smells fishy but profitable. I’m trusting the crooks to bring me the tendies. Smells like free money.    edited to remove any innuendo or unnecessarily forward leaning assumptions

ELI5 on Why the GME Rocketship is Done
There’s been a lot of Misinformation on GME ever since it mooned last last Thursday. I’ve spent some time grieving my losses and want to make sure normies with diamond hands know what they’re getting into. In the simplest terms:  Reasons why GME rocket engines will fail:  - Another gamma squeeze is very unlikely. $800 OTM calls exist for hedging. Also, this thread explains the conditions of a gamma squeeze for apes.    - Short sale restrictions lift on Monday. Expect more dips until GME stabilizes at market worth.  - If short interest is still >100%, that doesn’t mean that GME will squeeze. Shorts have been short at >100% for months and the conditions for rocket launches are no longer attainable.  - Robinhood and other brokers messed up, but it’s unlikely anything will change. The reasons they gave on why they limited GME, AMc, and meme stocks are enough to appease the SEC.  - The ITM calls that expired eod Friday will not cause a gamma squeeze  - Most folks who are deep in the red are experiencing internal struggles and facing the prisoner’s dilemma, will cash out at break even, and that’s ok  Wildcards:  - If institutional share owners decided to diamond hand GME like Porsche did Volkswagen, GME would reach Pluto  - which brings up the question, why do they own >100% of available shares?  - FTDs, if they are ever investigated, would probably make something happen  - don’t know the validity of this, but apparently an emergency shareholder meeting would force all shares to be called, also forcing shorts to cover. This sounds like fake news tbh so idk.  All in all, I’m just a retard, this is not financial advice  My position:   115 shares avg @ $403  Down almost $35k    edit1: forgot to add, I’m diamond hands on GME, a true re t a r d hoping for a cosmic event to unleash the Squeeze of legends. I just hope that my fellow apes can come to the bleak realization that they should probably look for new plays to regain losses since the stock market is still the Wild West at this point.
My GME gains from a week ago. Sold a CC on my shares and got assigned at $320 a share for $26k profit
Why was robinhoods excuse bullshit?
I am definitely not the most knowledgeable about the stock market and how it works, I just know the basics, so I was wondering why robinhoods excuse for restricting GME shares is bullshit. Everyone here seems to blame them for it and to me their explanation of the clearinghouse deposit requirements seemed to make sense.  Now I am not defending them at all, Im just acknowledging that Im pretty much a casual idiot in these sorts of things and was wondering if someone could explain why their excuse doesnt hold up, as Im guessing if everyone is blaming them this much then there must be a hole in their logic Im not seeing.
BANG loss but still holding
A little bit of gain porn for the weekends, bought in Nov, sold PM Monday. Now $150k deep in PLTR and withdrew the rest for RE.
We must adapt! Zom! To the moon!
GME Read the wicks: for every sale a buyer is snapping up shares and the price is rising.
$UWMC (now includes $GHIV after merger) is picking up institutional shares, had insane earnings that exceeded all expeditions and is ready to pop. shorts keeping it down and sold   mil shares thursday, but they can’t keep us down for long!
GME Institutions Likely DON'T Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze has likely Squoze
Y'all honestly just believe anything anyone says without looking into things for yourself.  I'll admit, I am not entirely familiar with Bloomberg Terminal but I use ORTEX and know that a shit ton of the data is usually outdated.  In the  , OP states that "up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings states institutions currently hold 177% of the float."    that they use a company's 13F filings to determine security ownership data.    to file theirs.  Meaning the main data that OP of the other post is using   is outdated   by at most 4 months.  It doesn't matter if Bloomberg says that it's updated as of today because   companies don't report their fucking trades every single day  .  It is entirely possible that when the Short Interest was at 120% 2-4 months ago that institutions held 177% of the float as that means there were 60M actual shares and 72M synthetic shares created by the shorts, and institutions only had to hold   of the 132M total.  And it is more than likely that after a shit ton of those shorts closed and a bunch of retail got trapped at a $300+ cost average that the % held by institutions will go down considerably.    on even normal securities is controversial, let alone on a stock that went through a short squeeze in which all of those written puts will be hedged against.  Short Interest is also a lagging dataset but S3 and ORTEX both try to estimate it.  ORTEX does so using data from lenders, brokers and broker-dealers who submit inventory and  .  I won't even go into the fact that   are back down to   and Interactive Brokers has shares back that are now lendable.  Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
OC: I made a video to help explain to people what a short squeeze is and what happened with GameStop over the past few weeks. Feedback welcome!
Regarding the removal of /u/zjz and other moderators
As many of you are aware, /r/wallstreetbets has undergone some changes on the mod list over the last couple of days. According to reddit, the top mods of the community were removed for violating rule 5 of the moderator guidelines, which is: "healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins." The attempt of the top mods to remove all of us and censor you failed, thanks to the actions of the reddit admins. We are grateful to everyone in the community who stood up for us.  Unfortunately, /u/zjz will also not be allowed to come back to moderate the subreddit. This is a decision made by reddit, not us, due to the instability that was created by his last post on the subreddit. We know the respect that you all have for him, each one of us mods has that respect for him too. The hard work and time that /u/zjz put into the subreddit cannot be replaced, but we will try our best to keep the subreddit up to his lofty standards and our high expectations.  Moving forward, we are working harder than ever and we need your help. Since /u/zjz ran all of our bots and was also the most active mod, there is a massive void left by his absence. If anyone has the desire to code a new bot for us and/or the time to moderate, as well as the experience on WSB (at least one year), we would appreciate your help.  Do not harass any former moderators. We need to move on from this and put it behind us all. This is the best community on reddit, let's keep it that way.   .
BB CHART ANALYSIS
Evening soldiers, hell of a week but I've been hard at work and I found a once in a lifetime chart pattern that I need to share with you. This is known as the "     Tester". Let me explain why, BB has risen to $28 recently and what did most people do? They paper handed the fuck out of it and it made BB mad, if you held you will be rewarded don't worry. Now here this is where the pattern comes in, as you can see in my analysis on Monday it gave us a test, you know when your gf sends a girl to flirt with you to see if you'll cheat to decide if shell give you some of her boyfriends money to gamble on options? Well you fucking FAILED. BB gave us $15 and you dicks sold out right away. Now its not over because BB is one of those you cant shake away, by calculating the length of the ATH this week and close to ATL x the date , you can safely calculate the projection for next   launch. This week was a flatline for a reason, were fucking FUELING UP HARD. Next week is going to be 8x more than $15. The moon is gonna be a pit stop. Were fueled for the FUCKING VOID                 Also, I am not a financial advisor gamble at your own risk.
Middle idiots of history
There can be more "shares" than original float. That's normal. Quit crying conspiracy
This can be found out with basic research and even in Mar Cubans qna he answered. There can be more shorts than shares originally issues. It's not illegal. Stop using this a defense. Pls sticky these mods. Don't forget WSB needs to be a place of actual information as well. And not just shit posting or memes   Mark cuban: "As far as naked shorting, thats not really a thing. Yes there can be more shares shorted than there are original float. That is by design. If i borrow a stock from you to short, and when I short it and your buddy buys it, then they can loan it to someone else to short, etc . All of those people who borrowed the stock paid to do so, and they realize that if enough people buy the stock and ask for the shares, they will get called in. So the chain of custody is there. The systems is doing what its designed to do"
BB: My totally not made up girlfriend who lives in Canada
This is not financial advice or an attempt to convince you to buy. I am merely sharing an opportunity I believe exists because the market has not yet come around to how BB has repositioned itself.    There’s also better DD on Blackberry than this and if you’re interested you should search it.     TL;DNR why BB?    1. Because they are a key player in the ridiculously lucrative software fields of advanced AI, cyber security and autonomous vehicles.   2. Because they are criminally undervalued based on their partnerships and future prospects (more below).   3. Because there is value. This is not GME, there won’t be another GME. But like GME in the fall when shorts didn’t understand the gaming cycle, there is a gap between prevailing opinion and reality.     Don’t they make boomer phones?    No. They don’t make  any  phones. In fact they sold all of their phone patents to Huawai. They have completely reinvented themselves as a software company and are on the cusp of a monumental turnaround.     Wait, so what do they do? (This part is IMPORTANT)    Software. And not just any software, but software that the market generally values extraordinarily high.   They are about to be dominant in automobile operating systems. Seriously. Blackberry. As u/gangusgun pointed out their QNX OS is in more than 175 million cars. They inked a deal with Baidu to develop their autonomous vehicle. They inked a deal with Amazon to develop and market BlackBerry's "Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform". They inked a deal with Sony to provide the basis for their EV. Their integrated system will be mass-produced and available on Guangzhou Automobile Group electric vehicle arm’s upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models. GAC has a joint venture with NIO.   19 out of 25 EV companies currently use QNX.   With GM and others moving away from ICE in the near future who do you think they’re going to partner with? Mother. Fucking. Blackberry.    Amazon. Baidu. NIO. Sony. (And SpaceX but that’s unrelated to cars). Do these seem like bad companies run by stupid people to you?  And yet, the market is still valuing this stock as if it’s making phones, rather than being the eyes and ears of every vehicle on the road. As u/forshakuras pointed out in their DD that you should really read if you have any interest in the company, BB is valued at $  despite $475M in recurring revenue and 26% year over year growth. Similar companies that have had slightly better growth but perhaps not as bright of a future (my opinion, not his) are valued at 8 times as much.     But it’s still just a meme stock right?    I’m not judging GME or AMC. You can see from my comment history that I have been talking about GME for a really long time. But GME was a fling. BB is not a company that sells physical games that no one buys in 6,000 stores that no one goes to. And while I think AMC could have a monster summer if people feel safe going to the movies it still has crippling debt and a fundamentally changed market where direct to consumer releases are now a thing.   BB got caught up with those companies because it’s viewed as wsb ‘tards making nostalgic picks.  Which proves my point that people don’t yet get what’s happening with BB.   BB is not a fling. It’s not based on a squeeze. It’s just a really, really good company that will steadily rise and could have occasional massive pops (consider the 65% increase the day their amzn deal went public).     Conclusion    My girlfriend lives in Canada. She is a smoking hot model but no one knows that yet. So ima lock her up. Shares. Calls between $20-35.

GME gain porn: $  -> $  in 26 minutes.
Welp, I guess It's about time I showed off my meager loss porn. Prices are in CAD and will be reshuffling things around today. Still gonna hold onto those GME shares, at the very least as a reminder of the fun I had.
GME overloaded eToro?
I live in the European Union. I am trying to open an account on eToro. They have just increased the minimum amount of the first deposit from 200USD to 1000USD. It also took them 5 days to review my proof of residence document. After 5 days they rejected the photo of my bank statement and now I cannot upload a new one. Each time I upload something, the app confirms it, then the file just disappears and I have to start again... I opened a ticket. This is the response I received:  "Dear Customer. Thank you for submitting your inquiry. Due to a high increase in the volume of requests, our response time may be extended. Please note that currently it may take up to 7 days for us to get back to you. We are working to handle all inquiries as quickly as possible and thank you for your patience and understanding during this time."  Two weeks just to open an account? Nice.

GME Guide and Common Misconceptions
Gamestop Guide:   &nbsp;  I spent some time browsing subreddits and reading a lot of misinformation regarding GME and its future. I am by no means a financial expert and I guess I am obligated to say this isn’t financial advice. I am just an engineer with too much time on my hands and I hate to see people get taken advantage of. I don’t know that I am 100% right, but hopefully my post helps at least one person.  &nbsp;    1. Was there already a squeeze?    By definition, yes, there was a squeeze. According to the S3 Partners estimates (graph linked below), the short interest on GME fell from approximately 69 million shares on 1/13/21 to   million shares on 2/3/21. This means that a portion of the price increase that we saw during that time was due to these short holders covering their positions.  &nbsp;    2. What if the short interest data is wrong/intentionally falsified?    More short interest data will come out on 2/9/21, but it is important to know that it will only show the short interest as of the end of January. If you think S3 Partners and the other players are intentionally falsifying data then there isn’t anything that I am going to say that will change your mind. &nbsp;    3. Could there be another squeeze?    There is the potential for another squeeze since the short interest is not zero. &nbsp;    4. What would it take to cause another squeeze?    Since the short interest is significantly lower, it would require more pressure to cause the short players to exit their positions. Based on the short interest chart below, it appears that most of the short positions were closed right before 2/1/21. In order to get to this point where the short holders decided to buy, GME bulls had to buy approximately $90 billion in shares. (This was calculated by multiplying the volume traded on every day from 1/25/21 through 1/29/21 by an average daily price and adding them together. I chose 1/25/21 as the starting point since the price was similar to where it is now). Since the current short interest is significantly lower, it would require more squeezing for the short holders to feel enough pressure to cover their positions.  &nbsp;    Common Misconceptions:   &nbsp;    1. I lost 70+% on my GME shares. I might as well hold since it’s basically worthless.    This is called the sunk cost fallacy and it occurs when we continue behavior because of previously invested resources. There are plenty of things that you can do with the money that you still have. There is an opportunity cost to holding the shares because you are missing out on other possible opportunities to make money from other investments. &nbsp;    2. I should hold for the long play since I am down.    Unless you purchased GME for the long play originally and are comfortable with their fundamentals, this is probably not a great idea. GME is still significantly above its price before the short squeeze started (~$5 per share) and even with the new executive leadership, it is highly unlikely that it will reach the current value in the long term. &nbsp;    3. Everyone is saying hold and diamond hands and I don’t want to disappoint them.    People who are still holding GME and hoping for another squeeze understand that if people exit their positions, there is no chance that they get another squeeze and they will likely lose more money. People telling you to hold or to buy have a vested interest in you not selling. It is also possible that they are trying to get more people to buy or hold so that they can exit their position when the price goes up. It is important to think for yourself and not just hold/buy/sell because someone tells you to. Do your own research and make your own decision. This is not a family or a team, this is the stock market and it is everyone for themselves. &nbsp;    4. I only lose if I sell.    You lose liquid assets when you buy and you gain them when you sell. The idea that by not selling your positions you have not lost anything is just not true. &nbsp;    5. I should average down by buying more shares at a lower price.    Buying more shares at a lower price reduces the average price paid for your shares, but it increases your exposure. If the stock continues to fall, you will lose more money. &nbsp;    6. We did it before; we can do it again.    The short squeeze that happened was the perfect storm of media attention and coordinated buying. We saw that there may have been some shady business by certain brokers or media outlets that stopped the momentum of the squeeze. I agree that it does seem like the momentum was stopped by outside forces early, however, that does not mean that it can be done again. There is no longer much media attention on GME and the attention that it is getting is not always positive. &nbsp;    7. What about stimulus checks, won’t that cause another squeeze?    I would not count on people putting their stimulus checks into GME stock. The media attention isn’t there anymore and a lot of people believe the run is over. &nbsp;    8. All the paper hands are out now so the stock will only go up.    Everyone has a price that they will paper hands at. Some people are not at that price yet so they are holding still. Some people just bought in for the first time. The paper hands traders are definitely not gone. &nbsp;    9. By holding, I am sticking it to the man.    While it feels good to think that you are taking down the establishment that you think has wronged you, it is important to understand that the short holders do not need your shares. You are not causing them extreme pain by holding. There are plenty of people trading and shares being sold that they could cover if they wanted to. &nbsp;    10. We are at (insert place) in the VW short squeeze graph.    This information has been shared over and over to try and make people think that the squeeze is yet to come. The VW squeeze was very different to the GME squeeze and trying to act like they are the same is incredibly misleading. &nbsp;    11. Anyone posting negatively about GME is a bot from the government or the suits.    I’m not saying there are no bots, but this is not a real argument. A lot of people who haven’t posted on WSB before were just lurkers. The amount of misinformation and garbage on the sub are causing people to start saying things to try and sort it out. &nbsp;  Short interest graph:   &nbsp;  For transparency, I believe that we have already seen the top of the GME squeeze and it will return to its old price so I have multiple GME put options. That being said, this post is not designed to make people sell or drop the price of GME, only to help people make their own decisions. As always, make your own informed decisions based on the amount of risk you can tolerate.
GME    gang... $5800 --> $531k  💸 🤑
THIS ISN'T ABOUT GME.
Disclaimer: THIS WAS POSTED BY  u/Foolmonso  BUT KEEPS GETTING DELETED. IT IS IN FACT ABOUT GME.    MODS COMRPOMISED. IF YOU THINK THIS IS SOLID DD, POST AS COMMENTS OR RESHARE, AS MODS KEEP DETETING.    I am not a financial advisor, nor am I licensed or in any way qualified to dictate or advise your trading decisions. I don't know jack shit about fuck. This is not financial advice. This analysis is not meant to influence, inspire, or inform you regarding your trades. This analysis was written purely as speculation and could be entirely incorrect. I found my own analysis interesting and wanted to share my unprofessional opinion. Furthermore, while these numbers are accurate as per their sources, they may not account for other factors that relate to the stock’s activity. I own shares of GME.     TLDR:   This is currently a war between funds. Your   shares don't move markets, you little fractional bitch. But if you sell at a loss right now, you're literally just giving them money like a fucking idiot.  Background: GME is owned almost exclusively by institutions and funds.    The combined top 10 institutions + 10 funds own   of the shares. I don't know what the fuck   of Shares Held by Institutions means (may have the do with the made-up shares fuckery, but I'm not going to get into that). The point is, institutions and funds own almost everything, retail owns almost nothing.  GME was already heavily shorted by late 2020. Likely more than 80% of those shorts occurred at $4 or less.  Late 2020 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ:    Note on shorts: When you short a stock, you have to pay interest   DAILY   on that stock at the   CURRENT PRICE  . If the stock's price decreases, you will likely make more money from the decrease than you will lose from the interest. When the price increases significantly, the daily interest may eat at all the potential profits you were hoping to make.  Early 2021 Short Interest Data sourced from Capital IQ:    As you can see above, in late January, the price of GME kept rising, and it likely became unprofitable/risky for these short sellers to continue holding their short position at these prices. They likely knew that the price was eventually going to go down, but it must have cost them a fortune on a daily basis to continue holding. This leads to some of them trying to cover their shorts, which led to the price rising even further, which led to others trying to cover their shorts, etc. Combined with retail mania, this is what created the "squeeze."  So the short interest goes from   to   and the price went from $  to $     Now, we know that the shorts were NOT covered.   I refer to this excellent post here as to how it's basically mathematically impossible for them to have actually covered:      But there's another simple reason why the shorts weren't covered:      Who the fuck is going to leave their money with a fund that loses 53% of assets in a single fucking position? The ultra-wealthy whose assets these hedge funds manage would all immediately withdraw all their fucking money and sue for breach of fiduciary duty.    Melvin may have told the media that they covered their shorts, but I guarantee they fucking called every one of their clients and told them they hadn't covered, and that they had a new plan. Get an injection of cash from Citadel and Point72 ($  Billion) to pay the daily interest rates on their shorts, and run a FUD media   against these retail morons to sell and tell them that the squeeze is already over - while Melvin waits it out. "The shorts have been covered, anyone left holding the bag is a fucking moron."  So what's the current situation?  1)   Team A Hedge Funds:   These are the morons who shorted the stock at $4 and below and are currently bleeding. Some of them definitely covered and exited, but it's mathematically impossible for all of them to have covered. These are the REAL BAGHOLDERS. They literally lose money every day that they hold the short as long as the stock is over $4. They need the price to go down to reduce their daily bleed. They need to buy to stock back eventually to stop bleeding or reduce the price to $4 or below again.  2)   Team B Hedge Funds:   These are the sharks who sensed the blood in the water and shorted the stock as it was rocketing up. They hold shorts likely in the $150-$450 range. On paper, they have made a fucking fortune and are planning their next move. They love these currently "low" prices and want to buy back the stock and cash in their profit, but they can't do so too quickly without shooting the price up again and losing that profit margin. Because they shorted the stock, they are also bleeding. They will need to buy these stocks back eventually, before their profit goes to nothing (this could be a long long time).  3)   Team C: Institutional Holders and Fund Holders:   These guys basically hold all the shares that Team A and Team B Hedge Funds want. They're currently sitting on massive paper gains and want to squeeze Team A and Team B for every cent they have. They know Team A and Team B are bleeding, and that they must eventually buy back the stock (especially Team B since Team B wants to actually realize their profits). They're comfortable sitting on their profits, but they're also very comfortable bleeding these guys out knowing they have to buy back, and they can wipe out a competing fund in the process. They are also very happy if there is another squeeze because rather than sell 5 shares, they would love for the price to jump 500%, sell 1 share, keep 4, and continue bleeding Team A and B.  What's happening right now is that there is a war being waged between these three groups. Do not underestimate the people who work at hedge funds - they are extremely intelligent, extremely greedy, and extremely competitive. If a moron like me can dissect the situation, they all have certainly figured it out as well. What's happening right now is they are trying to find a market equilibrium price without giving away their positions. Team A wants to cover, but can't seem desperate or else the price will skyrocket. Team B wants to "cover," but can't seem greedy without eating into their profits. And Team C wants to sell and realize their profits, but they can't all do it at once without tanking the price.    And you, my paper handed fucking mongoloid friend, when you buy high and sell low, you literally throw your fucking losses into this pool for these three to fight over as they try to minimize their losses/maximize their profits.    The short interest is still massively high and this story is just beginning. This is not the end, despite the FUD and the shilled pessimism in WSB. Will it hit $300 again? Maybe not. Will there be massive volatility as they duke it out and the opportunity to break even/profit? Yes.  This is not financial advice. I am not telling you to hold. However, you have already paid for your ticket to this show, think about maybe sticking around for the ending.
APES ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO SELL GME AND AMC AT A GAIN (controversial)
Retards, everyone and there wifes boyfriends are posting closed positions for massive gains on amc and mostly gme today. Remember that last weekend hedgefunds paid a lot of money to advertise a silver short squeeze as a diversion tactic to take attention away from gme. If you actually do post about true gains in this sub, by all means that is fantastic and i am happy for you! (Not trying to prevent people from taking gains). But to all the true autists that are in the 300+ club or whichever club that is still holding, don’t let this demotivate you from holding. This is very likely another attempt from them trying to get us to sell, thinking everyone else is (also notice how 99% of them are in robinhood). No one is going to know much about a short squeeze until february 9th when the shorts are officially released, so just sit tight until then.

A guide to the Moon for new investors around here.
This came from a conversation with a friend who's getting into the game a bit. I started trading right before Rona (Feb 23rd I picked my stocks, before J-Pow even unveiled the money machine!). I use strategies ranging from dedicated ETF portfolios to charting, and have found success in both (trading account around 130% this year). Here's some help based on what I've seen on here over the last year and the pretty significant reading I've done on investing theory-     1. Start finding formulas that work. That’s a good way to learn a lot about different elements of a stock For example, a “buffet” style approach might have you look for a PB under 1 and a PE under 15, throw that in the screener (I like   Find filters that stand out to you and google them. Play around and you'll learn what's useful to you.    2. Cross it with some trading strats. See which the best trades are based on those Then do some real DD (personally I check the financials a bit, Google news, Reddit search, and then whatever else makes sense at the time). "Time in beats timing" for sure, but there's no reason not to understand what RSI is. Having more tools to make decisions with is usually a good thing, just dont use them all every time.    3. Expect to lose some trades, but it’s the price of the lesson. Losing money isn't that bad if you stick to the rule of only investing what you can afford to lose.    4. Things that make sense sometimes don’t actually make sense because of some absolute shenanigans. It happens. Move on and laugh it off. There's forces at play that you don't even know exist.    5. Don’t get cocky, it makes you sloppy. Develop a system and stick to it. Do you only invest in companies with positive PE ratios? Sure, if you have a reason for it why not. Change when the evidence suggests it should, but remember to keep learning new ways to evaluate and cross check moves.    6. Largely disregard other people’s opinions, as they’re based on their situations. Someone who just bought a house will have a very different approach than someone in college, and someone with $2k has a different approach than someone with $20k, and $200k.    7. YouTube is really helpful, so is Reddit, but keep in mind they all have personal motives and likely already own the stock they’re talking about so they are pumping it. Not that that’s a disqualifier, but it is a factor.    8. Don’t be afraid to be wrong. It can be a lot of fun to experiment, and 'losing money' on a lesson learned can be more valuable than a monetary gain if it helps you make better choices in the future.    9. Once you start having significant profits, it gets a lot easier to take losses. When you can lose $1k and still be positive by a healthy percent, it’s nbd. You'll get there, be patient and consistent. $1k seemed hard, and then $10k seemed hard. They say $100k is the hardest, but it’s really just discipline. It’s not like we’re throwing money at garbage, and we have thought out systems guiding our decisions (develop those)    10. The coolest thing is how it compounds. It’s actually my favorite thing in the world. The snow falls on last weeks snow and gets bigger and bigger. Eventually, there's so much snow that it causes an ice age.    11. Other people’s limits are not yours. Just cus they can’t do it doesn’t mean you can’t. This is all pretend, and literally anything is possible. Don’t get discouraged by bears, they just don’t see green. 'The crash' has been coming since April, but "time in beats timing"    12. Take breaks. You don’t need to make every dollar on the market, and it can deff get addicting/drive you to a breakdown since there’s so much to learn    13. There’s a lot of noise. Tune it out and focus on your niche. You’ll find what you’re good at by experimenting, and the trend changes about every two weeks, so it’s pretty fun!    14. Knowledge is a great investment. I haven’t bought a single piece of investment literature/course that I regretted (check out One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch or Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel)    15. For every buyer there’s a seller. Someone has the exact opposite opinion of you on every move.    16. When listening to old wisdom, consider that the infrastructure that makes today’s trading possible wasn’t even an idea yet (discount brokers, social media trading, internet, the lack of fees). The new rules enable a new approach.    17. Whats best for you is different than whats best for me. You need to go through the learning process to grow as a trader and investor. And there is a big difference between trading and investing. Both are viable, as they both make money, and I find using them in tandem is most effective.    18. Lock in your profits. If you can protect your initial investment, do it.    19. "Get money, buy income." Take your trading wins and roll them into safer dividend moves to lock in your victories, or open new positions! (This is for trading, buy and hold your investments. Again, there is an important difference)    20. Please learn what a share of a company actually is, why they go up and down, and what market price actually means. This will allow you to make much more informed decisions.     Hope this helps someone! Keep those fists clenched and tendies coming. Ik this isn't quite as memey as the regular posts here, but there are a LOT of new members who likely don't get the culture and may have trouble distinguishing     Obligatory Position: HRB $17 C 4/16

Bored of GME now. I've been following Aston Martin for the last 3 months and here some DD
So been tracking James Bonds favorite car company for the last few months and all I can say is I'm glad I put money into it as its currently up 25%.   Early last year the ass fell out of the company and  they almost went bankrupt. This is where the big man billionaire Lawrence Stroll entered and bought a massive stake in the company and used his contacts at Daimler Mercedes to help turn them around.   Mercedes currently own a 5% stake in AM which will rise to 20% in the next few years.   AM have a technical partnership with Mercedes to supply technology for engines, mechanical and electronic parts.   They will have their own F1 team this year which is free advertising and promotion to a global audience. They are also supplying the safety cars this year instead of Mercedes.   The head of AMG is now tasked with turning the company around. He is more than capable and with Mercedes getting a 20% stake they are not going to let it fail after all their investment.   Stock is currently priced very low. Look at the graphs from 12 months ago before the new guys stepped in. If we get back to those levels then it would be more than a 400% increase from where we're at now.   Their new car the DBX has been recieved very well and it caters to a new market of family friendly Aston rather than supercars. When they switch to EV they will have all Mercedes tech to play with.   Get on board early and get into a position to get blasted on Martinis and buy some sick James Bond cars (headlight rocket launchers and ejector seats not included).  Link to Financial Times article with Tim Moers     Pasted from article The brand will release 10 derivatives of existing cars within two years including two offshoots of its new DBX sport utility vehicle, as part of a planned model offensive, he told the Financial Times.  Mr Moers wants to refocus the company on engineering and bring more of its development in-house from suppliers, while working more closely with Mercedes-Benz to produce bespoke engines for the company. Daimler, Mercedes’ parent company, owns a fifth of Aston’s shares and already supplies the British carmaker with some technology. He also plans to boost Aston’s German engineering outfit, which is based at the country’s famous Nürburgring race circuit. “Our technology partnership is there [in Germany], all the engineering suppliers are there, we should do something there to get the most efficiency out of the whole corporation,” he said. Mr Moers was parachuted into the role from head of Mercedes’ AMG, the high performance subsidiary, over the summer by Aston’s chairman Lawrence Stroll, who led a rescue of the business earlier in the year. Mr Stroll aims to restore the marque’s luxury credentials, and has installed a team he believes will help the business begin generating positive cash by 2023. His arrival at the company this year also coincided with a large-scale clear-out of its executive team. As well as a new chief executive and chairman, within the last year the company has replaced almost every top flight position, including the most senior executives in finance, sales, product planning, operations, engineering and the US, its largest international market. The company has pushed back its first battery electric model, which will now be an Aston Martin instead of a Lagonda, the luxury sub-brand that is part of the group. The company has yet to reveal its new plans for the Lagonda nameplate. “The electric car has to be an Aston Martin,” said Mr Moers, “because if you bring a new brand to life for electric vehicle cars, that’s wrong in my perspective.”   Edit - currently in for   shares at £  with more when I get paid.   Also I'm still in for GME with a couple of shares. Managed to get out at gains of 270%.  Edit 2 - I have just been added to a controversial subreddit because this doesn't fit with your gamestonk narrative which is hilarious. Before most of you joined this subreddit it was for people to post their DD around potentially risky plays on the stock market and then post loss and gain porn not fluff peoples egos because you're balls deep in a meme stocks and latching on to optimism. The stock market is so much bigger than AMC and GME and whilst most of you are waiting for the short squeeze to happen (if it ever does) most of us who got out early enough or have spare capital like to spunk our money elsewhere.

Just a thought...
First, the formalities: Not exactly new to investing, but still going through my paces. New to WSB, fresh retard here, bough into FOMO, holding because I have nothing much left to lose. 13 shares of GameStonks @130 avg. 11 of AMC at "idc, like $13 or something"  Now. I see so many posts about "you only see the message the mods want you to see" and also do many "sell and cut your losses" posts. But I've also seen some well thought out DD on GME, and I have massive confirmation bias for this, seeing as I'm banking on it to go up to "win my money back" (money I  could  lose, but really don't want to.) I'm not selling, I don't have too much left to lose at this point, I'd rather stay in it on the chance of a second squeeze.  But back to the main idea here: I've seen a lot of "sell, cut your losses, reinvest" posts. I've seen a few notably good DD's on a probable second GME squeeze. I'll two and two together, and that adds up quite nicely with that old advice about "buy when others are selling". Point is, I got into this on mob mentality and hype. I learned my fuvking lesson about that, and now I'm sitting on >50% loss. But it doesn't seem quite right to get out of this on mob mentality, right after learning that lesson.  Two reason's I'm staying and holding then: 1. I have little left to lose on this, I believe that GME fundemental are changing enough so that selling now would be at a low, which is a terrible. "How much worse can it get?". I'm willing to gamble what I have left for the next week or three on the DD and possible second squeeze. 2. If everyone is here for thier own gain, and everyone really IS manipulating my noobiness for thier own profit, and those same people are the ones telling me to sell, then I'm not fucking selling. I'm not selling and getting left in the dust like this. If have to die on this hill, then good luck killing me, because I already have.  I have a gut feeling that this is the dark part of the tunnel, and I'm not quitting just because I can't see the light at the other end. This is the part of the movie where all seems lost, right before the final spectacular triumph. I'm gonna be there for the end.  To all the other holders out there:  If you can pull out with gains, or at least minimal losses, then evaluate your position and decide what is best for your situation, your mental health, and your long-term stability. Don't gamble your life on a meme, even if it's more than just a meme. Keep a stock as a souvenir or a ticket to the launch, if you do decide to leave. I think you would regret selling at a loss now, but there's the chance that it could be the right decision. Either way, pull through and commit to and live with that decision. Most importantly, take away your lessons. Write them down, or tell someone else exactly how you feel right now, and what you think you should remember from this.  If you're in this like me, balls deep and waiting for the squeeze, then I think our best move is to HOLD together. I don't think that selling for substanial losses is worth it at this point. Look at it. You sell now for -50% or more, decide to take a break, put it in an index or something and it grows a measly 8%? Meanwhile, you'll be glued to GME. Imagine if it moonshots. Your realized losses might feel bad, but it will be all that much worse if just a week or even a day later it moons, and you took your losses in vain. I think the game is worth it.  Either way, I would wait for us to get numbers on the 9th, that's when we will be the best informed to make our decisions. I foresee a lot of quality DD on that data we get, so watch out for that. Hedges seem scared, that gives me a bit of heart too. What have they to be scared of if it's all truly over?   TL;DR:  Ignore the haters, check your fundamentals, make a realistic assessment of your situation and your risk. Wait for the data on the 9th. If minimal losses or gains, I suggest hold, as this is probably rock bottom, and we only go up from here. But make your own decision, based on your financial stability. If balls deep and all in, I say HOLD, and hold strong through this week. We're in the worst part of it right now, but no one ever said it would be easy. The best things never are.  If you are a literal ape and/or can't read:        Oh, and also, feel free to post your loss/gain porn. If you need a fellow diamond hand to hold through these dark hours, PM me.  Obligatory: I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. I'm not even  that  experienced. This is my own personal opinion, and nothing else. My favorite flavor is crayola forest green.

Ranking of Corsair’s Total US Market Share by Product:      -   Keyboards: 2nd  \- Mice: 3rd  \- Headsets: 4th  \- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd  \- Performance Controllers: 2nd   \- Memory: 1st   \- Cases: 1st   \- Power Supply Units: 1st   \- Cooling Solutions: 1st        -   Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well.  \-   Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.   This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.       Q4 Earnings & Beyond   (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).  These are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale  \- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday’s earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion’s share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals.  \- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.       Competitor Comparison      -   Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech.  \- Logitech currently has a market cap of $  billion, Corsair has a market cap of $  billion.  \- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $  billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $  billion.  \- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.  \- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million share float (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)    I believe Corsair is severely undervalued

$12,000-$84,000 with GME. Somehow got $250,000 in margin for ARKK because I kept buying and never received an error message so now I'm holding $350,000 in ARKK.
If You Don’t Know Whether The GME Squeeze Has Squoze, You’re Right
(Disclaimer - this was a reply I posted in a previous thread - you may have already Reddit. Also not a financial advisor do your own DD) _____________________  To those who think the squeeze has squoze and those who have not. You’re both right   To state the obvious, last week Hedge funds were caught completely off guard and there was a massive massive gamma squeeze / short seller meltdown which crescendoed Thursday morning.   Many are looking to the next short report to determine how squozen we truly are. Do not place too much faith in the 2/9 short report. It won’t tell you much imo.   Why? We sat at 100% short interest for 6 months+ with no squeeze. Squeezes require catalysts and multiple catalysts are in play at the moment.   So how do you determine if HF and others are still massively short?   One Answer: check your own broker. Can you short the stock? Are there shares available? If cost to borrow is over 15% and/or there are no shares available - it’s a crowded short no matter what the report says. You can likely check on the weekends too.   The current rate on IBKR is   and there are 800k shares available to borrow. This rate is lower than the previous average of ~20%. Shares available to borrow  have been anywhere from 0 to 1 million.  So IBKR to me indicates some potential covering and slightly less squeeze potential.   But also keep in mind, if the short report says 44% of the float is short - this is still insanely high and about 2x what I would consider a crowded idea (20% is crowded imo). So don’t be fooled into thinking the covering is over even if short interest dips to lower levels.   To me it feels like Old Wall wants the price down. Why? I’m not sure exactly. But even the dreamers on Twitter who have spent the past year pumping Tesla think GME is a bubble. Lol. People thought the Tesla bubble popped last year in Feb when it peaked at $  (pre split, so actually $190 versus $850 today.  Again. People thought the Tesla bubble popped at $190.)  As for GME, Hedgeye had a $100pt. Citron covered and is scared to short. Lots of other hedgies will probabaly never pile in short to this name lest they have to explain to investors why they were burned twice.   I don’t think RC bought at $16, risked locking up his money for a long time, simply to EaRN 5 pECEnT PeR YEar.   Insiders haven’t sold except for one. Company hasn’t sold and is instead pumping the news flow up with Amazon hires. DFV was in at $4. He could have sold at $60 and have still been a legend.  Dr. Burry is currently - as recently as last night - been tweeting about Gamma squeezes.   So let’s not pretend like any of us know exactly what’s going on. But uncertainty creates opportunity.   If everyone knew we were going to squeeze again, the price would be much much higher and you wouldn’t be able to buy at these levels.   This is still a highly volatile situation. In my opinion, the risks are extremely high both ways but I would be terrified to be short right now.   Mainstream media’s mis-reporting of GMEs prospects, literal trading suppression by brokerages, threats of investigations, etc - if you just think about it - can only be doing one thing which is holding the price down.   So to the extent GME is being manipulated at all, it’s very much to the downside imho.   While it’s frustrating to be misunderstood by big media, big Twitter - whatever. In the end, it literally will not matter.   The ball spiking that CNBC did to Elon and TSLA while they were down - may have felt good at the time to them. But boy did it cost them in the long run.   And it’s not like CNBC made a mistake and then changed course overnight. They tried to FUD Tesla into oblivion through the entirety of 2020 while the price ripped in their face relentlessly. And then ripped some more. And some more. Sound familiar?  This suppression can be reversed explosively with:  More Insider Buying New Insider Buying Strategic Partnerships Earnings Beat More short covering  Possible Gamma Squeeze Round 2 (I think unlikely) RC memes   Speaking of Gamma squeezes - and I would love some fact checking on this - but I think one of the reasons we cannot repeat is because deep OOTM ($800) calls now exist. MM can hedge with those rather than only through purchasing shares which they had to do when every call written was a Delta 1, thus very in the money.   But finally - an investment thesis that relies on a squeeze is not much of a thesis. It’s really a combination of A) the market realizing fundamental value is much higher all at once .... which causes B) forced short covering with limited exit paths.   VW squeezed for purely non fundamental reasons and it came back down to earth.  I firmly believe GME “squeezed” for fundamental reasons which could make this rally far more sustainable. Again, see Tesla.   Just take a look at RC, e commerce valuations, and the types of $$ GME is doing. There’s value here.   Other than all that. I have no opinion on the matter. Excuse incoherent rambling and any typos.

The Interstellar Yoyo ⭐🪀⭐
Hallo all. I've been watching what's going on with great interest. There have been many things I can't explain. So I sat down and did a Think. But I know we're all just simple apes here, so why don't I tell you a bedtime story instead?    Story Time    Imagine there's a GME market participant, looking for a quick buck, with not the best grip on morality. I know that's a big stretch, but just go with me. We'll call him 'Snidely'.  Snidely is big into shorts, where you borrow a stock from someone, sell it immediately, and have to buy it from someone else later. But normal shorting isn't quite exciting enough for him. He wants to go naked. A naked short is when you skip that whole 'borrow' step at the beginning.  So Snidely notices that, due to   days to actually find someone willing to lend him that stock. This is great news for Snidely! It means that he can sell a stock he made up on the spot, then look for ideal times in the next 2-3 weeks to find someone he can borrow from to un-make it. So long as the stock price even temporarily falls below his sale price sometime in the timeframe, he can make money by borrowing at that point. He just found a freakin' cheat code for cash!  And so Snidely issues the naked short sell, and sells off his newly minted "stock". He finds  buyers, and has no problems with that bit. Shucks, he can actually sell a little under market level if he needs to - After all, he can always just print more stock. Hahaha, Snidely goes brrrrr.  But then the unthinkable happens. Some idiots actually buy the stock, and the price stays higher than he bought for the entire 13 settlement day period. FUCK. Now he HAS to borrow, or he loses access to his wonderful money printer, as per  .  So he does. And loses some money. It sucks. Oh, and the stock price went up, because he had to buy so much. And then some moronic internet forum notices him doing this, and starts to buy too. Fuck. FUCK. If this idiots actually manage to peg the stock at this level, he'll be out of a job. He might actually have to buy the cheap caviar, or whatever it is the poors eat.  So Snidely looks in his bag of tricks... and only sees one trick. And so he begins naked short selling stocks that he knows he doesn't have yet. He does it a little below market rate, because that helps cool the stock off, which helps him. He has 13 whole days for the stock price to drop, after all. He uses the money from the new shares to start borrowing shares to cover his old ones. Weirdly, the liquidity isn't as low as the numbers would suggest, and he's able to borrow enough to cover his position fairly easily.  Plot twist - Snidely isn't the only Snidely. Snidely is legion. And as each Snidely pursues this plan, the stock price drops, since they all feel comfortable selling a little below market. And while they're covering, they  buy up each other's made up stocks .  They haven't fixed the problem. They've just moved it 13 settlement days down the road. And made it bigger.  And once one of them starts buying to cover their new position, the rest will panic and join in, and the stock will soar again.    Evidence    Sooo... if this story is somewhat true, what events should we have already seen?    We should expect to see a slightly less than 13 settlement day period between stock increases, because if Snidely's wait too long they lose access to the ability to naked short. Given that GME first jumped in price on  , then again on the 26th, that gives an 11 day period - Exactly in line with what we expect.   We should expect to see anger and push back from wall street in that same slightly-less-than-13-settlement-day period, fading rapidly as they choose to 'cover' their positions by selling more fake shares. This is more or less exactly what we saw on this subreddit.   Shorts should be extremely eager to tell us the closed out their positions, because they also opened new positions and NEED the stock to go back down before their time limit runs out. Yup, we sure as fuck saw that.   We should have seen Failure-to-deliver figures high, and growing.     We should expect to see a sky-high official short rate that  isn't  reflected in third party data. We already see that in the existing data.   We should see the SEC being uninterested in the shorts/Snidely, because no actual laws were broken by this behavior. And wow would "uninterested in the shorts" be a motherfucking understatement for what the SEC is up to.    Anti-Evidence    Some stuff doesn't fit neatly into this theory, and needs other explanations or caveats.    Robinhood and other brokers shutting off buying is not directly explained by this. Buuuut I feel like the current explanations of increased capital requirements due to Snidely-induced volatility mostly does a fine job of explaining this.   We shouldn't see firms resorting to illegal tactics like ladder attacks, since they can accomplish their goals legally. But every instances of a 'ladder' attack we've seen is better explained by a Snidely bulk selling naked shorts.   The push for the fake 'Silver squeeze' is not explained by this. I think that was just an opportunistic play, rather than an actual distraction attempt.    Predictions      An actual short squeeze will never happen. The Snidely's can just print more naked shorts whenever they need them.   We should see Failure-to-deliver figures jump when the next data dump occurs.     We should see a growing official short interest that isn't reflected in third party figures.    We should expect to see a massive rise in the stock price about 11-13 settlement days after the last large stock rise. Which puts the date for expected movement around Feb 10-12     Conclusions    Sorry friends, this isn't a VW-style short squeeze, infinite squeeze, or rocket to the moon. It's a fucking interstellar yoyo that's going to keep shooting up higher and higher in nearly-13 day intervals until  something  breaks.  Stock owners aren't the bag holders. The Snidely's are.    Dirkson, what should I doo    ?    Oh, hell if I know. I'm not a lawyer, your lawyer, a stock dude, CPA, CFA, CFP, or whatever. I'm just some idiot who thought it was a good idea to buy two shares at $300. I wasn't even one of you before the Vast Migration, and I still don't talk right.  None of this is legal or financial advice, I'm just discussing what I think is happening. Think for your own damn self!    TL;DR    No 🌕. Yes ⭐🪀⭐.   Edit: Feel free to copy/paste this anywhere else you like, just PM/ping me when you do. I'm interested in what other people think about this idea, and don't care who reposts it.
My thoughts on the current gme situation. I invite all to discuss.
Sharing my humble opinion on the current gme situation. I invite you all to discuss  #Stay Fucking Strong         💪 💪 💪  If you were faced 70 BILLION in the hole, losing to self proclaimed retards, autists, and degenerate gamblers you’d be doing EVERYTHING in your power to not lose.  I read a post that said this is financial warfare, we’re in WWIII right fucking now. It’s the 99% vs the 1%. It wasn’t a joke. We broke the market last Thursday and they want to keep us down.    It will not be a big swoop, currently it’s psychological warfare - want confirmation look at any social media or main stream media. They’re either silent or telling you you’re an idiot. The hedge funds want you to sell, they want you to feel like an actual retard. Look at the Melvin citadel tropic thunder meme, look at the “ladder attack” meme. Fuck look at all the shit head memes that are not making any of us feel good.   #hold the fucking line because this IS bigger than all of us. Realise your place in history and take part in showing Wall Street that retail investors can say what the price is at.   These fucks are mad that you are not doing what they say and what they want to you to do. The free market was established to let the people (common people) invest in what they want & make bank collectively.   With every decision you make comes a form of belief, which is a truth in this world. You believe in love, laughter, family yet it can’t defined by any one word sentence or photograph. The shorts -are- still higher than the float, and what the fuck are people missing here??  WE LIKE THE STOCK BUY THE STOCK STOCK GOES UP HOLD THE STOCK UNTIL WE FUCKING WIN. You’ll know when we’ve won.   I’m fucking disgusted by what this sub has become. Infiltrated by bots, shills, provocateurs. The old crowd might never come back unless we grow a pair of balls stop wallowing in self pity and fight together like the wallstreetbets we are.   Please think for yourself. Do not yolo your life savings in hopes it will rocket to the moon, do not put yourself at risk of losing the little stability you’re holding onto right now in hopes this will be your light in the glory hole tunnel.   But if you can... Do you want to stick it to the people who said “hell is coming” and then made BILLIONS of dollars off the little people??? Do you want to fight for the people who worked 20 years day and night to grow their restaurant, ma and pa retail stores who are locally owned??? Fucking fight for all of those people. The situation seems absolutely ludicrous and ridiculous that THIS RIGHT HERE is our fight, but do not get confused or allow the media to gaslight you. We DID break the market, we did make every single hedge fund shit their pants but this fight isn’t fucking over.   You need to dig deep as this is emotional, hope is emotional, making a change and defeating a bully is hard as fuck. LOOK AT EPSTEIN. Guilty as mother fucking sin. We don’t even have a mother fucking answer about that one.    You think the people in charge are just going to give up? That they won’t pull every single dirty, manipulative, callous, petty, illegal trick in the book to make sure a bunch of autists and retards lose it all??? Fucking wake up and ask yourself where you want to be next week, a year from now. Do you want to look back 20 years and feel like you got fucked in the ass?? Fuck no. It’s that simple. Hold the fucking line and make sure everyone else does the same (within reason!!) or we deserve the royal ass fucking these elites give you every single day, stroking it to the loses you took in 08.   This is not financial advise. I’m not a financial advisor and fuck you to everyone trying to destroy mother fucking retail AGAIN. Seriously when the fuck is it going to be enough for you greedy ass fucks?
Just a bit of chop 🌊🌊🌊
Just realised the villain in Casino Royale is the original king autist, borrowing tens of millions from a Ugandan warlord on margin to YOLO it all on puts
Serious Question: Couldn't someone orchestrate a short squeeze entirely by themselves?
EDIT 3:    u/quacks4hacks in particular can lick my bridge ______________________________  Okay so, hear me out...    Shareholder Hold All 100 shares and refuses to sell (there is zero market liquidity, zero supply to even one buyer = infinite demand to supply ratio; share price skyrockets)  Short Seller borrows 50 shares to sell to the market (liquidity emerges, supply and demand becomes a rational ratio, prices stabilize)    Shareholder buys 'new' shares directly from the market (all 50, s/he is willing to pay the price to get every share out of the market's hands).  Original shares = 100  Borrowed shares = 50    Shareholder = 150 Shares  Then   shareholder calls the 50 borrowed shares back... and refuses to sell.  Is this something that can happen? And if so, what is the absolute cheapest stock on the market (market-cap-wise, I mean) that allows options trading?  Asking for a friend. _______________________   edit: Seems like if a company is 100% owned by a single investor it is no longer a publicly owned company, and would get delisted. This still raises two questions:  1) What happens if there are already short sold shares out there floating and someone just buys up enough shares to own 100% of the company. Do the shares then get called back in order to delist the company? Does the company simply get delisted with one individual owning more shares than originally existed?  B) How many people would have to own 100%, collectively, in order for this to occur "organically" within the market (at which point the company does NOT get delisted)? Obviously y'all are gonna be like 'cOlLuSiOn iS iLlEgAl" but yeah like we haven't seen plenty of collusion and no one got sent to jail for it. One of y'all said it best on another thread: SEC fines are just budgeted in.  _______________________________    edit 2: it seems like a lot of folks here are taking things way too seriously. This place is supposed to be (or was, anyway) "like 4chan found a bloomberg terminal" not "r/investing, but rude." Hopefully I didn't dishevel anyone's tie this morning, damn.
Then why are you still holding?
GME SI FINRA Data Trustworthiness
I see a lot of us are waiting for the SI data to be released Tuesday. Firms have to report short positions to FINRA but they could lie or not provide accurate data. The fines for doing so seem like a small price tag for doing business. How reliable is this data? Knowing all the shady shit that's been going on these HFs might just deal with the fines.  Position 1313 shares     Ex.   was fined    of past disciplinary actions.

A case for going long on $LUV (Southwest Airlines)
Heyo WSB  Forgive the degenerate writing, I just like this stock and want others to know about it.     What is Southwest Airlines?       Southwest Airlines Co.   is a major American airline headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and is the world's largest low-cost carrier.  The airline was established on March 15, 1967, by Herb Kelleher as   Air Southwest   Co. and adopted its current name, Southwest Airlines Co., in 1971, when it began operating as an intrastate airline wholly within the state of Texas, first flying between Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.  Southwest operates a leisure-focused low-cost carrier,   which is well-positioned for a leisure-led post-pandemic recovery in aviation  .  Southwest has generally been able to achieve low-cost carrier unit expenses and passenger yields close to legacy carrier levels.    Southwest’s focus on providing low fares could allow it to make inroads with business travel in the current recessionary environment.      Why get in now?    1.    CFRA Maintains Buy Opinion on Shares of Southwest Airlines Co.      "We lift our target to $53 (from $48), 20x our 2022 EPS estimate (raised to $  from $ ; 2021 unchanged)."    Q4 adjusted EPS of -$  vs. $  beat consensus by $     Revenue fell 65% Y/Y in Q4 as the pandemic continued to depress air travel demand.   Yet, despite the quarter’s major resurgence of Covid-19, which led to new travel restrictions and business closures, LUV’s revenue grew 12% vs. Q3.   Such strong sequential revenue growth in this harsh environment suggests that there is significant pent up air travel demand. We think this demand will start to be unleashed this Spring as vaccines become widely distributed, allowing LUV to soundly beat revenue and EPS estimates for 2021.    Additionally, despite the unprecedented demand weakness,   LUV has maintained a strong balance sheet with negative net debt throughout the pandemic.      Manageable debt, strong customer loyalty, and efficient operations will lead LUV to be the first major airline to recover profitability, in our view, which we expect midway thru Q2.      2.  Southwest has used the pandemic as an expansion opportunity, adding 14 new destinations since March 2020.   Overall, the 14 new destinations added or announced by Southwest since March 2020:     Chicago O’Hare (ORD)   Houston Bush Intercontinental (IAH)   Jackson, Mississippi (JAN)   Savannah, Georgia (SAV)   Miami and Sarasota in Florida   Fresno (FAT), Palm Springs (PSP) and Santa Barbara (SBA) in California   Colorado Springs (COS), Montrose/Telluride (MTJ), and Steamboat Springs (HDN) in Colorado   Cozumel (CZM) in Mexico.         3.  Passenger traffic is likely to be severely depressed until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed.    Southwest no longer operates only Boeing 737 aircraft.  Unit expenses are likely to decrease, as the 737 MAX is recertified (as of November 18th, 2020).      LUV is the king of US domestic air travel and has the strongest balance. 115 million Americans will be fully vaccinated by Summer, another 100 million by end of Summer. These 215 million will be living life like 2019. The other 115 million by New Years. LUV will be back to 2019 peaks in 2022.   Buy now for the bargain pricing. It will be a bumpy flight for a while, but calm and smooth in 2022.      Ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, show that the leisure market can serve consumers that are particularly cost-conscious.        4.  Upcoming plays:    First     Quarter Earnings Announcement Expected   04/22/2021.     That's it. Thanks for reading (if you made it through).    Good luck everyone. Would love to hear questions, opposing ideas, and thoughts.       Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, I'm just excited about this stock and the future of airline travel in general.      I'm not holding stock in any airline, and I'm not being paid to write about this or any other funds.     I'm just bored.  Past performance doesn't equal future success (except when job searching). Hit me where it hurts if this DD sucked.

GME Update 6th of February - Sorry Bois it was quite a busy end of the week so I couldn't post and be that active but yeah, here's a 113k Loss Porn for u guys
Let’s get back to the YOLO’s
WSB just looks like the pennystock subs now with every post being about holding. I miss the old WSB where someone like DFV would YOLO a shit ton of money into a stock. Like, the good ole days with the SPY calls. These accounts that are barely 3 weeks old and only know about Reddit because of GME, they shouldn’t be allowed to even leave a comment here. With, literally, every post being about holding gme and amc, this is no longer wallstreetbets.  This subreddit has become WALLSTREETBAGHOLDERS  Yes, we know to hold because of what is going on right now. Stop fucking posting about it every minute you fucking retards.
A 3 year P&L history of WSB Degenerate trading. Am I doing it right?
Short sellers may have doubled down on GME since the big rally to $300+. Here's a list of evidence that brought me to that conclusion:
#1: GVIP has dominated the S&P 500 in performance over the last week    Some context:  GVIP is an ETF that tracks popular hedge fund long bets.  Below is a chart that compares the 5 day performance of the GVIP ETF vs the S&P 500.     Over the last week (Friday last week to Thursday this week) GVIP has outperformed the S&P 500 by   That's a TON. Furthermore if you do the same comparison for Monday this week to Thursday the outperformance of GVIP rises to approximately  , for Monday-Friday the outperformance was    To put this into perspective look at the historical performance of these two side by side since Jan 1st 2017 (essentially inception of GVIP) and you can see that GVIP in the past has modestly outperformed the s&p 500 with GVIP returning on average (roughly)   per month and the S&P 500 returning on average (roughly)   per month (A total of 127% gain for GVIP and a 73% gain for S&P 500 over \~49 months). 2%+ out performance over a short period of time (a week or less) is massive variance to the long term monthly averages.     My hypothesis here: Hedge funds have been increasing short bets (on gamestop and other stocks) and plowing the cash they are receiving from the short sales into their favorite stocks. This pumps GVIP higher explains some of the difference in short term performance    #2: Short Volume has increased as a percent of total volume    First up its important that I note the different between short VOLUME and short INTEREST. Short volume refers to the number of shares sold/bought in short trades each day. Short interest is the total outstanding number of shorted shares.  A large increase in short volume as a percent of total volume indicates that something is going on. As you can see from the chart below this new activity started on 12/27 (the day that gamestop had the highest price) and continued. While its hard to tell what is actually going on here it looks like there has been a paradigm change  My thesis/opinion: Short sellers have been doubling down with the recent price increases. A combination of a high amount of short selling (as a percent of total volume) and lower liquidity is fueling the current price drop          #3: Price changes in gamestop stock seem to be strategically timed with short interest reports    Every 15 days the SEC requires shorts sellers to report their positions. This information is then made public 7 days later. It just so happens that 1/29 was the reporting date for short interest (to be published 2/9). I've placed 4pm on 1/29 on a chart of gamestop below:        My opinion: Short sellers want to give the impression that they closed their positions - so that we get paper hands. To do this they exited (or pretended to exit by substituting their positions for naked sold call options) leading up to the reporting deadline. Now they may have started to re-enter those positions    #4: Anecdotal evidence    4a: People have been posting screencaps to this subreddit that shows overwhelming good sentiment for gamestop stock. One of the things I've seen pop up on this sub lately is the total volume of buy/sell orders from retail brokerages. These have been skewing very positive still. If its not the retail investors selling, then it must be institutions either exiting long positions or starting new short positions  4b: The diamond hands on WSB are real, and sentiment has been fairly positive (despite sub drama, and a massive price drop)  4c: It appears there is a continued effort to spread disinformation and to keep the stock price down. Anyone seen those advertisements for silver lately? Why would someone go to all this effort if short positions have been exited?  4d: S3 partners estimate of short interest (as of about 7pm on 2/4) is around 26MM shares (see below). This is down from the official short interest number on 1/15 of 61MM shares. If we truly underwent a short squeeze, would half of them still be here?       #5: Interactive Brokers Short Interest Data on 2/5    On Friday (2/05) morning we experienced a big jump in gamestop's stock price (to around $82 by 10am). Around the same time the short share availability dropped over 1MM shares at interactive brokers for gamestop.     My Thesis: While short share availability can drop for a number of reasons (and there is no requirement to immediately sell borrowed shares) its my opinion that that someone borrowed a bunch of shares from interactive brokers and shorted the morning's spike which halted momentum in the stock price  \_\_\_\_\_  TLDR:  My opinion: What we experienced the other day was a half baked short squeeze, the game isn't over and shorts are still playing. However, these shorts may have taken positions at higher prices and lower borrowing rates (see above screenshot) and therefore may be harder for gamestop to shake.     Big shoutout to the mods: Thanks u/swedish_chef_bork_x3 for helping me get this posted     Disclaimers and related positions I hold:  This is not investment advice, please make sure to do your own due diligence before placing any trades.

Gme bb pltr - cashed out for 100 tsla
So is there like a TLDR update to the GME situation??
I haven't invested as Covid-19 really nuked my income. But I've been following the story and wow it's amazing what's been done. Feels like the first good thing to happen in this country after a very long period of bullshit jenga.  Anyways, I don't think I'm the only one that thinks the story is getting a bit complicated. There are those that say hold and those that say sell.   Forgive me if I'm waaay off but I've never even dabbled in stocks, but I don't think I'm completely hopeless. Correct me if I'm wrong here:    The shorts that hedgfunds were holding have already been sold right? Because robinhood forced the price to go down so that the hedge funds could minimize their loses before they were forced to sell. I assume the shorts were sold as MSM are reporting the losses at 50billionish. I guess I'm asking if the squeeze is still going on or if it happened and now there is another squeeze going to happen or what?    If that's right why are people on WSB still holding?? Also with people cashing out which I don't see as bad, because the whole point was the screw over the %1 and take that money from them put it in our pockets, I would assume right now is the best time to short. Right??    In what situation would GME go back up right now??
Second post about why selling 30% together will cause the spike and why Gamma squeeze didnt happen.
I posted earlier about cutting loss on 30% on your GME together will do the magic.   So many of you called me retarded and think that holding 100% diamond hand will do the job. It would have done the job if wall street didn't have the solution for it. They avoided Gamma Squeeze like nothing. Do yall know how they avoided Gamma Squeeze? They bought number of shares they needed to cover their naked calls before last Friday. Thats why no Gamma squeeze happened.

Thanks GME. From 3k to 55k actually, graph is weird in revolut. Still riding some shares.
What the F is share lending?
I read several comments and posts across reddit talking about not lending your GME shares for shorting. But there seems to be a lot of misinformation or lack of understanding around this topic. I'm not going to tell you what to do, but only what it is.   Most proper brokerages have share lending programs, which you have to sign up for and only then they can lend your shares for shorting. In return you get a part of borrowing fee, which differs based on short interest. These programs may have different but similar names in different brokerages such as fully paid security lending (ally) but are available in most brokers.  One of the biggest condition for the program is that security should be fully paid   not on margin. Now we know most of retail shares of a particular popular stock are not on margin anymore.   Brokers need to place a security cash deposit for you when borrowing your stocks since during lending you dont get SIPC protection on your stocks.  ~~A little conspiracy theory here, during a short squeeze brokers that have lent out shates would be killed for that security cash requirement. So that explains why they want to avoid squeeze.~~  Anyway, Is it possible that you have signed up for such a program without knowing? Yes, and that you can check by simply calling broker and asking about the program and telling to opt out of it.  You can also google "your brokerage" "share lending program" to find out what fancy name your brokerage has given, so you dont sound retard when calling them to opt out of it.   One catch though- wsb favorite Robinhood doesnt have any such program, meaning they can and they will lend out your security without your permission and without sharing any borrowing fee/interest with you.  And btw those rocketships     in subject are to bring you to read this.
10k down but these   are   reee
WSB is literally being debated about at one of the largest dedate tournaments in the country.
Question 1: Why is Biocryst (BCRX)'s Berotralstat not priced in at all!?
This post comes directly from u/bio9999 .. If you are interested in some amazing DD - give him a follow. Also, we actually have our very own subreddit so please feel free to take a look there as well for all the DD you could ever want and need! r/bcrx        First we are going to look at   Biocryst’s   recently approved drug   Berotralstat  , AKA   Orladeyo  . It is a   once-a-day pill   given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called   Hereditary Angioedema  , that results in them having to   frequently visit the Emergency Room   for life-threatening angioedema attacks (check out Youtube for videos of HAE patients suffering from these attacks and using Berotralstat). It is estimated that this disease affects   1 in 50,000   people in the world, or roughly   140,000 people  , so although considered a rare disease, it is still affecting a   lot   of folks. The available treatments for this disease are   all IV drugs   that are painful and produce local reactions. Berotralstat is the   first oral drug  . It achieved excellent results in phase 3 trials, and the US FDA gave it   fast track  status in 2018 and Japan gave it   Sakigake   status (type of fast track). Then   on December 3rd, the US granted approval for the drug  . They did it very importantly with   zero label   statements--meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers.   On January 22nd, Japan granted approval  . The   EU   also met last week to discuss approval and will announce its result   this quarter  .  So let's look at what the above means for this stock. First the drug is in   HIGH   demand. In the US there are at least   10,000   people with HAE. Despite the disease being frequently debilitating, patients are so uncomfortable about getting regular injections that   only 7,500   are currently being treated with IV injections. The other 2,500 are going   untreated   despite the high risks. Now let's look at the 7,500 patients on a prophylactic treatment. Based on numerous surveys by doctors, the company, and researchers, most of these people would prefer an oral treatment. Take a look at this peer-reviewed survey article finding that   98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment  .     No wonder then that one of the preeminent biotech analysts, Evercore's Liisa Bayko, wrote to her clients on December 4th that Berotralstat was likely to quickly   take at least 30% of the HAE market  based on Evercore surveys of patient and doctor demand.  Remember that this is   just the US  .... Japan did not even have any prophylactic treatment until Berotralstat was approved there a few days ago. They have   500 people registered with HAE   and estimated   2,000 ready to be registered  . The   UK   is so desperate to add the drug for its patients, it did not even wait until the formal approval process to go through and gave   early access to the drug on November 9th  .  .  The EU is not far behind, with its estimated   20,000 patients  , with approval coming in the next few weeks. Then there is the rest of the world. The HAE patient population in   Latin America   is estimated by   HAE International  , the most important advocacy organization for HAE patients worldwide and one of   Berotralstat’s biggest supporters  , to be   over 15,000 patients  , the vast majority of whom are poorly diagnosed and not prophylactically treated. Argentina and Brazil have the highest actual diagnostic rates. HAEI through its Latin American sister organizations is strongly advocating for Berotralstat in Latin America.  Next, it should be noted that Biocryst built a   world-class sales team   for this drug in the US and EU and signed a   partnership with Torii in Japan   to take charge of the large sales and marketing promotion there. It has hired dozens of professionals, most from its HAE competitors. Its   vice-president   and US general manager   Allen Hodge   was even responsible for the   successful efforts of the HAE drug launches   of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task.  It should also be pointed out that this drug, an oral kallikrein inhibitor, is potentially of   huge value for a host of diseases, including COVID-19   (that is now recognized to severely affect the kallikrein-kinin system, and kallikrein inhibitors have begun to be tested against COVID19--see this (IV)   kallikrein inhibitor trial that was just announced in Brazil   for instance:  , many autoimmune diseases, and even some types of cancer.  Last but not least, how should this stock be valued based on this one drug? First, this drug is   one of the 10 most expensive drugs   (based on its annual cost of prescription) in the world, but still   less than the price of its IV competitors  , at $488,000 per patient per year. This drug is being approved by insurance companies   left, right, and center   as their preferred treatment, all you have to do is follow   R8   or   nickpd   on Stocktwits to see how many insurance companies have been making it easy for patients to sign up for the drug.   Optime care   even lets patients get   direct-to-patient   prescriptions now ( ? I   estimate conservatively   that by December 2021, there will be   over 6,000 patients on Berotralstat in the US, EU and Japan  , and I can share in a future post the graphs and calculations I made to get to those numbers. 6,000 patients annualized is up to   $  billion in annual sales  .   Most   of this is going to be   profit  . At a   conservative price to sales ratio of 7  , that should produce a price of   $121, not $   ! And that is   just the beginning  . Because Factor D and Galidesivir are going to be much bigger than Berotralstat for reasons I will explain in future posts. Remember that \ \ its Factor D drug, which is showing superiority to all other anti-complement drugs in Phase I trials and was fast-tracked and given orphan status by the FDA and now is in Phase 2 though not officially announced by the company eyt,\ \ and can be used in at least 20 diseases including common ones like Rheumatoid Arthritis, is currently   not even factoring into BCRX's valuation  . Consider that   Alexion with its significantly inferior anti-complement drug was just sold to Astra-Zeneca for $39 billion   because of the   recognized potential of anti-complement drugs   for a host of diseases. BCRX even has has   other drugs like Peramivir, already approved for Influenza and able to be used for the next bird flu pandemic, and its FOP drug--a story for another day  .  So why is this company, with   zero risk of dilution   due to an   amazing royalty deal   it signed in December and   three super-drugs   each worth tens of billions of dollars, and a host of other exciting developments to look forward to,   worth only $  billion right now?   It can only be because the company's stock has been   relentlessly shorted in 2020 and 2021   to allow for significant accumulation by institutions. That is why the stock   only went up 168%  , yes "   ONLY   "   168%  ... The time for BCRX investors is   now  . My next post will be about Factor D, brace for that one. Factor D is 10 times bigger than Berotralstat! Good luck to all!     Disclaimer: I own shares of BCRX (10,300 shares). Thanks.

"This is for you, dad" Interview with an anonymous Gamestop investor - Matt Taibbi (substack)
tought on WSB and what happened during the past weeks
i only got here 2 or 3 weeks ago. being on reddit everyday i was bound to find this sub. when i got in the the sub the stock was at 20 bucks. since DEEPFUCKINGVALUE seemed to be the worshipped god of the sub at the time i got on youtube and watched his videos about it. what my take was from listening to him was that GME was at 14 and the company was probably going to be worth 60 a share in the future. he said it could even get to 70 if it does very well.   he didn't sold at 420 and im sure glad he didn't because i believe they could have gone after him.  now for the ape that diamond hand and all that, please still hold. i love that stock for real and i wanna see gamestop succeed in the future. i could spend hours in that store when i was younger and i can see a brick and mortar store opened in big cities with a good chunk of online retails. who knows .. they could become the amazon of games.  love you guys and love the sub. the meme are amazing   sir, this is a wendy's
Some loss porn for ya! Since some of ya'll got paper hands.
Only room for one "APE" in this town
SNDL has   BILLION shares issued. There is no short interest, this isn't GME. The vast majority of you will be bag holders!
Guys, you do realise SNDL has missed its Q3 revenue target from $20.2million to $9.6million?    And that it has   BILLION shares issued? Meaning even at $3 a share you guys are inflating a company with an income of likely 55 million a year to a valuation of   BILLION.    Does this seem sound to you retards? Stop munching on the crayons for a bit and think about it. You are talking about pumping it to 10-50-100-420, and not by any short squeeze, but by sheer pump of money. A situation far beyond what is happening with the other green stocks like TLRY, OGI or APHA.   Anyone heard about the pump and dump before? About bag holders? Anyone?   Edit: For anyone that still is on the fence about this. Don't let yourselves be taken advantage of. The normal increase for weed stocks up until now after hours has been 5-15%, SNDL has 101% as I am writing this:             Ask yourselves, does the after hours SNDL growth seem legit compared to other weed stocks? Should I buy this overvalued piece of garbage at open or just cancel my order?  This isn't the weed legalisation wave that SNDL is riding, but the pump and dump wave where there have to be a lot more losers than winners.
Proper, Detailed DD On Options For This Week!
Edit: Unity and Peloton are still slipping. While I still stand by them 100%, getting in later today is probably a better idea. I am sorry if you bought at 126 or so on Unity (though it is holding it), but it should recover this week.    Good evening, gentlemen. I present to those reading this a few options plays for this week that I'm pretty confident are going to print. Rather than holding losses, these couple of plays will likely give consistent 50-100% profits. I edited out the no-no words and crude jokes after auto-mod keeps taking this down...whatever.  1. Chegg ($CHGG) puts.    Chegg has been running up to an ATH ahead of earnings. As noted in my last post (  , their guidance generally falls short. The stock is currently way overextended, and with the somewhat-near reopening of schools, there will be a   on their growth projections. I'm predicting a pullback to $95 or so.    Suggested options: 2/19 100/105 put debit spread (sell 2/19 $100P, buy 2/19 $105P), OR purchase the 2/19 $90P   2. Unity ($U) calls--SAFE TENDIES  EDIT:Still slipping today a bit. Advisable to wait until afternoon or so to enter position   As you may have noticed, Unity (software developer, about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech) took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it dumped 14% from $147 to $128 in a frenzy of selling that, importantly, had several spikes to $140. There is still positive buying pressure.   Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, guess who bought the dip? CATHIE WOODS. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th. Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity, and the spikes back to $140 intermittently on Friday exemplify the buying strength. It WILL return to $140 soon unless the market as a whole dives.    Positions: $U 2/19 $140C, 3/19 $150C.   3. Peloton ($PTON) calls--Trust The Woods    Peloton was another company that had stellar profits, but dumped heavily on minor slowing growth projections. Revenue? Increased 128% to $  billion. Subscriptions? Increased by several hundred percent each for their Connected Fitness as well as digital subscriptions. Your wife? Getting heftier each day, and mad that her $1900 bike order is getting delayed due to the massive flood of orders. Peloton has had to spend about $100 million to address these delays with expedited air shipping and the like. Aside, do NOT forget they also are acquiring Precor, giving them a solid footing in the post-Covid gym ecosystem.   What happened to the stock? Again, like Unity, dumped solely because of minor dents in their projections. It also nicely recovered during the day (I managed to get in at $143, hehe)   TL;DR? Peloton's bottom line is not affected significantly. Their growth is explosive, and continuing to rise. Cathie Woods again acquired another tasty 106,200 shares for ARKW. What does this mean? If she buys the dip, you need to buy the dip too.    Suggested options: 2/19 $150C, 3/19 $165C   4. Twitter ($TWTR) puts.    As in         the October before that....Twitter earnings generally dump the stock at least 10%. Why did it do this every time? Slowing user growth, as well as uncertainty regarding ad revenue (they stopped running election ads) meant that the stock dove off a cliff every time. Now? People are (likely) leaving Twitter in droves. I had some info here about why, but I'm assuming that the auto mod keeps removing this post after I say the name of the former President, so I'm just going to leave it at that.   Technical analysis? It's been running up to an ATH. The potential for it to dump right after earnings is INSANELY high--all it needs is a slight blemish on projections. And I'm pretty sure there will be many, many scars on their projections.   On the flip side, their profits will likely be very good. Thing is, I simply do not see how banning the former President will help their bottom line and growth projections. Let me know what you think about this below.    Suggested options: heck, why not 2/12 $50P for $93. You could do a longer date and higher strike, but honestly, either it dumps or it doesn't.   5. ArcelorMittal ($MT) Calls--steel gang isn't done yet    The reasons for purchasing $MT and other steel stocks such as $VALE and $CLF have largely not changed. However, most of them have been sadly flatlining other than $X's brief rocket to $24 before pulling   then doing an offering.   The normal reasons still apply--demand is high, supply is low, new infrastructure projects on the way, etc. This is pretty much just a gamble on earnings positively reflecting on the factors already in existence, and giving some momentum back to the stock. Plus, the calls are pretty cheap with relatively low IV, so it doesn't hurt to toss a little money at it. But to be clear, this is a much less assured play than the 3 I have already listed.    Positions: $MT 2/19 $23C for $66. Could also just YOLO a 2/12 call on Wednesday at market close, should cost around $30 each   There are some other very major earnings coming up this week as well. Disney, GM, Uber/Lyft, Enphase. I might also do some weekly $DIS calls and ride the run-up to earnings, and then sell before earnings as positive Disney Plus news might already be priced in with their Investors' Day fireworks.  In any case, I might post some more DD on other things I find and research. Only slight annoyance is that barely any people see these types of posts amidst the "har dar GME give me upvotes because I spent 30 seconds making this meme"

They couldn't beat you, so they're buying up what can be mined from you.
I know people have been trying to mine data from r/wallstreetbets for far longer than its recent attention from major news, but now it's worth big money. To me, this is proof they're taking r/wallstreetbets seriously and they're thinking twice about what's next.
Arbitrage until the end of the year fellas! Free money until November if you play it right!
You can quite literally send a GME stock (certificate) to the moon on an astrobotic mission...
What happens when people buy the wrong   and   cause a short to panic!
So the Canadian stock Green Thumb Industries Inc. Which trades under the symbol GTII on the Toronto stock exchange has gotten a lot of attention lately due to legal weed. Well that stock trades as GTBIF on   exchanges in   dollars. The   Stock GTII is a dirt cheap penny stock that is Global Tech Industries Group, Inc. Well, when I was looking to buy Green Thumb a few days ago I accidentally found myself looking at Global   led me to wonder how many others might make this mistake. It turns out a LOT of people. Now what happens when volume spikes massively on a gently shorted over time penny stock? Well the short at first doubles  up thinking it's free money.   However, when you get multiple days of spiking volume the short probably starts to panic. Imagine you've shorted millions of shares of a podunk stock with 50K a day volume and suddenly people are buying it up? You're going to burn.  I've been watching this. I got in at $  then got out thinking it was   no, I got back IN for bigger and more! So Friday it closes up 115% at $  with over 2,000,000 shares traded. The short is now way in the hole and this thing is   were   shares shorted Friday according to    DD   results may   if this stock breaks $1 on monday and starts listing on the "Biggest Returns" charts for the last few days it's going to the moon.
I had paper hand, sold some GME, told myself would donate some profits to Autism Canada. Let’s hold for more for charity!     🤲
to 90k. Sold at 300, secured the bag and payed all my student debt. Now averaging down from 250 to 50. Got 100 shares at average 170 to ride the wave.
WSB has become Qanon for the retail investor
Call me a shill or a cuck or whatever, but the number of conspiracy theories that people are passing around is insane. GME went from $4 to $450 in a matter of weeks, but people want to blame everyone from hedge funds to RH to Janet Yellen to other users on this sub for it going back to Earth. If you bought early and didn’t sell when it mooned, that’s too bad and if you bought in at the peak, you’re fucking stupid. When a stock moons, the backend always crashes about 10x faster than it took to shoot up. Take some responsibility for your fucking decisions or get the fuck out of this sub. I just want things here to go back to the way they were before we gained 6 million new users.
To all the newbies still spamming about the GME squeeze and diamond hands: STOP BELIEVING THE SUB IS COMPROMISED JUST BECAUSE MODS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 5-6 YEARS REMOVE MISINFORMATION ABOUT GME OR A POST THAT BREAKS LIKE 7 POINTS OF THE WSB CONTENT GUIDELINES!
Some mods have been removed, YES, but most of the OLD ones STAYED and they are doing everything to get this sub back to PRE GME standards!   THIS SUB IS   -NOT ABOUT GME  -NOT ABOUT AN ANTI-WALLSTREET REVOLUTION  -NOT ABOUT POLITICS  -NOT ABOUT COORDINATED STOCK BUYING  Diamond handed newbie apes still not believing me? Just for Christ's sake read u/theycallmeryan 's post AND Stylux 's comments below it! They are both mods and they explain the situation PERFECTLY and CLEARLY.

$100k YOLO on $GME with my 401k
Not bad for a 19 year old eh?
Inception recap up to 1/29
Broke college student who joined wsb a year ago, peaked at 90k by buying nok otm calls, but I held and then RH fucked us
A little bit Cringe, if your deposit is not like this.
3k -> 38k -> 14k. Down around 25k in $BB and $FUBO, holding until zero or hero!
Since some people seem to think I'm a bag holder, here's a Yolo I'm currently in. Held 350k of $GME which is worth around 1/5th that
When people are still holding their $400 bags
Win some, lose some. Put in $100k at $60. walked away with $136k. I still consider this a loss.
I’m lovin it

GME THURSDAY 2/11/2021
We need a GME thread of positivity and absolutely buying the dip . Mods are      if they remove this . We all know what’s happening and you cannot manipulate us . If we didn’t sell at $400 what’s makes you think we will sell when clearly fishy things are happening and they’re trying so desperately to silence us . It smells like money 💰 , fuel up the rocket . We’re going to see what Pluto is all about .
$  PowerHouse Energy Group, finally done with development of DMG technology
Is this financial advice? No  Am i slightly retarded? Yes.  Is the energy sector massively overlooked at the moment? Indeed  The following Quote is taken directly from the website:    "  PHE uses Waste to Energy expertise to help customers destruct and recover energy from their challenging waste streams  ."  Useless, cheap and unrecycable plastic-waste can finally be turned into a monetized product, which also solves one of the greater challenges of mankind - dealing with waste streams  "  DMG® Technology developed and owned by PHE delivers value for customers through producing electricity and hydrogen as well as other chemical precursors.  "  The end product can vary from Heat, Electricity and Synthetic Gas - one which is Hydrogen.  A key differentiator is that DMG can produce clean energy from    ALL    difficult plastics  The DMG technology is future proof and demand will increase eventually. Why? The process generates source of high purity hydrogen for vehicle fuell cells PSV & HGV  The engineering behind the DMG technology is party patented and partly kept confidential, so that they can protect themselves.  So how does PowerHouse Energy plan on generating consistent revenue?    Well it sounds promising: Revenues will be generated from licenses and engineering support of its DMG waste to hydrogen and power product   Strong commercial partner in Peel NRE Environmental developing first facility and UK business plan of over 77 facilities   The first application of the DMG technology is in development at Peel's Protos energy park in Ellesmere Port   The Plastic Park is planned to handle around 300,000 tpa of plastic   A target of at least 30 DMG sites around the UK will be achieved. Under the terms of the agreement with Peel, 30 operational sites would generate £    JUST   in annual licence fees.   Subsequent to Protos the Powerhouse business strategy has limited risk exposure and low capital overhead.  And we are talking just about potential Sites in England, while demand in plastic waste solution is increasing globally  Can this easily get to  € - 1€ in the next few weeks to months? Yes!  Ill definitely hold for long. I see alot of potential  Not a Pump & Dump  Get in the bus, its not waiting any longer!  10000 @ \ €

A guide to how I day trade
1. I Don’t go all in on trades, I keep some $ aside to dollar cost average if a trade goes against me.  2. I try to average 2-4% gains per trade, if it goes down 2-4% i can either take a loss and move on or if there’s no bad news and I’m confident it should go back up, I dollar cost average to lower my entry price.  3. I manage my emotions no matter what way the stock heads, if im panicking when it goes down im more inclined to make a bad decision, if a stock goes up, I don’t pat myself on the back thinking this is easy and get used to winning.  4. Sometimes there will be bad news and the stock might open 10% lower. If this news is not potentially going to end the company, I need to dictate more time to holding my position. Generally stocks tend to go up overtime.  5. I AVOID MEME STOCKS. By the time it became a meme the party’s already over, I also avoid FOMO (fear of missing out) if a stock has risen too much too quickly, people will sure be taking profit.  6. The more money i have on the table the more the gains and losses, if im making 2-4% profit per day trading day (roughly 253 days) that’s roughly 500-1000% gains in a year. If im compounding my gains the % gains in a year are a lot higher.  As for stock picking, I usually look at a lot of different charts on the stocks on my watch list and make decisions based on the recent news and trends, If the stock goes down a bit I look at the risk vs reward, if stocks are going down 4-5% + without bad news there’s a higher chance of the reward being higher than the risk.  If the SNP500, Nasdaq, dow and SPY have had a lot of green days I expect a quick pull back which is when I make trades on volatility, I jump in and out of UVXY when this happens.  I also look at the volume and which direction that volume went with the price.  There’s a rule called pattern day trading, if im trading with below $25k in cash balance and stocks, i can only make 3 day trades in a 5 day trading period otherwise a 90 day trading ban, this applies to margin accounts, cash accounts incur a T+2 settlement waiting period.    I’ve been using this method and it’s working out really well for me so far.   Feel free to list your own methods that works for you :)  Edit: edited so I’m not giving financial advice, this is just my method, again, feel free to list your own.

🌳 The case for Canopy Growth (CGC): THC DRINKS 🌳
Imagine you have the main ingredient to any beverage containing alcohol and there are only ~5 major  competitors in the world (who have the right connections). And now imagine that instead of alcohol it's a substance with no calories, no hangover, no increase in blood pressure, and it just mellows you out during a time when the whole world is on edge.   --    Several Dems (Cory Booker just this week) have said they're voting on weed by the end of the year. 91% of America supports legalization. Once weed is legalized the banks in the US open up to companies, the connections in place get set into action, and the market explodes.     CGC just delivered another quarter of record revenue, and they project profitability in 2022. They are building a track record winning in core markets, while also accelerating their US growth strategy. Their CEO, David Klein, was a top executive at Constellation Brands, one of the biggest alcohol distributors in the entire world. You want a huge cooperation to distribute drinks, write commercials, social media ad blitzes, SuperbOwl commerials, and then people are hooked. Constellation Brands is just that. CGC has also the advantage of a portfolio of compelling brands like Martha Stewart CBD, BioSteel, This Works, and Storz & Bickel.     The company has been spending large resources in developing the right brands and distribution in the   Another key has been purchase of 70% of the equity in Acreage Holdings (ACRGF). The company has an end-to-end platform in 15 states, covering cultivation, processing, dispensing and branding.  --   Weed drinks will be one of the biggest profit centers. That's where a lot of the money. Consumers with money won't smoke or eat weed. EDIT: Yes eating is the same as drinking (my bad); but consumers are foolish and many will want to consume weed like beer / wine. Smoking certainly isn't for everyone.  --  EDIT: For the record I think Tilray and Aphria are awesome plays too. I just don't have the balls to play such high flying stocks, but that's probably just my weakness. Tendies for all! Imagine when NYC legalizes. We'll all be winners.   EDIT 2: My position is 128 shares at $46 (I'm young and poor).     TLDR: Patch   released. WEED = NEW META. So, raise a glass to THC. Tomorrow there will be more of us.
GME Ryan Cohen DD #stillholding #diamondhands #ilikethestock
on November 16, 2020 The letter to GME Board of Directors, the title reads: Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the ULTIMATE Destination for Gamers (Cohen didnt use the word ULTIMATE lightly, proof below)   Cohen mentioned he wants to   disrupt industries     Cohen has done it before with this   ULTIMATE   Destination idea with Chewy   -   calling it the   1 stop solution   \- Chewy rapidly expanded product offering to include all pet food and supplies so there was never a reason to shop elsewhere. By 2018, 90% of our revenue was from repeat customers. Cohen is planning to do the same in Gamestock (and how did Cohen achieve (90% repeat customers? cont. reading)   Cohen left Chewy because - I’m a   business builder,   not a manager. My work was complete. But I was   no longer in FULL CONTROL.   And I   DIDN'T want a BOSS. (meaning he wont be passive in GME board, if the letter to the board didn't make the point clear enough)      Formula for creating Fans  (90% returning), not customers:      net promoter score   (NPS), a common measure of customer satisfaction, Chewy always 87 and above at Chewy. lemonade is at 70 .

We   hired artists   to turn those photos into personalized portraits of their pets, which we sent to our customers. These are   high-quality drawings  , something you’d want to hang in your bedroom. Today,   thousands of those portraits get shipped out every month  .     - flowers   when their animals pass away.   \- A   24-hour   customer service line promises to answer any call within   six seconds.     \- And, yes, the   customer is always right.     \- If they needed something   faster than we could ship it, like that day  , we told them to go to a local store and buy it and we’d   reimburse them       - fairly common   to see calls with customers go on for   4 hours  . That was a good thing because we knew that   meant someone was happy  .   Who can argue for four hours?     This created Fans, just like Apple/Tesla -   Fans tell all their friends and family   \- When people shop at Chewy, they really understand   we care about them  , we care about their pets, and they want to tell all their friends and family."

Hiring      Will   hire the best people   and   delegate   into their areas of expertise. (proven by recent hires)   We   hired for passion  .

You’re a dead man walking, and Amazon will crush you.     not afraid to go against   the the board/traditional rules - building a company in Florida rather than a popular tech hub. spending $3 million a month on TV ads, more than Home Depot HD  's budget. hiring expensive executives even though we weren’t profitable. These decisions were some of the most controversial and required me being comfortable betting against conventional wisdom, and were often contrary to the advice of my board. Suffice it to say, I was not the most popular board member.

I was constantly bombarded with new ideas, and when you’re growing quickly it’s critical to stay focused, so I said no to almost everything.

Its about time this thing gets made)                 update 1:  alot of ppl are asking what the price target is. So im going to give it a shot, but since im such a newbie, pls advise if im calculating this wrong.  P/S Ratio     =    current share price        /      \[1 year revenue/ shares outstanding\]         currently                =              $                      /                        2 years down the road, maybe    20                =                 $                   /                    # $  ... ~32x in return       Assumptions:    PS ratio of 20 - im comparing with the companies below, which can be very controversial because i heard we are not suppose to compare PS ratio between vastly different companies, but im doing it anyway. And of course, GME is being priced as a growth stock at this PS ratio level.  TSLA = 27      ROKU = 38     BYND = 26    LMND = 78     SQ = 16     1 year revenue - stays the same. Which I don't believe it to be true since there will be additional revenue from adding PC gaming, computers, monitors, game tables and gaming TVs to its store + boosted online revenue (Cohen is very focus on). Which also means my price target of $  is too low.     Shares outstanding - stays the same. (which likely will increase but it shouldn't be too much since Cohen explicitly mentioned "Maximizing Stockholder Value" + his track record of Chewy
How to make tendies. A comprehensive guide.
Step 1) Visit Wall Street Bets subreddit and look at memes to determine which industry is on the rise.  Step 2) Purchase the least expensive stock being touted in that industry by the poor investors here who think 1000% gains are norm.   Step 3) Sell it the next day for maximum earnings because every new user here like me has no idea what they're doing so they just hold until the end of time or bankruptcy as their stock slowly depreciates.
AMC & GME tickers looking identical again. What a surprise...
Anyone else suspicious about all of these beta ass weed memes?
What the fuck is this? You’re telling me  this  week there is just a bunch of memes that are like “when the $GME holders switch over the weed” and it’s a picture of a dog or something retarded like that? Either the 🏳️‍   s are trying to meme or we’re watching Melvin and his subs try and make us think it’s our own. With the 6 million Facebook moms and “thanks for the kind gold stranger!”s coming in I don’t know what’s happening but it’s cringe. just look at some of the memes they are low effort and unfunny. That’s not us. BUY BLOCKBUSTER!  Edited : for spelling and so that any hedge fund looking at this can SUCK MY BALLS
InvestorPlace has written a positive article in support of GME Diamond Hands Apes!
As a holder of GME shares (and also AMC, BB, and NOK shares) reading this article gave me a lot of hope. In the past two weeks, we've been accused of being an echo chamber and supporting confirmation bias. We've even been called a delusional loser cult by our many haters who are desperate for us to sell our GME shares. Therefore reading this article from a respected objective source like Investor Place really made me feel good after a long time.  For those who don't want to read the entire article, the author writes a warning to the short sellers. He writes that short-sellers/bears are used to speculators who invest in stocks for profit. Short-sellers know how to deal with these speculators because speculators scare easy and will usually cut their losses, sell, and invest in different stock. However, the author states that short sellers should be very worried because these retail investors from r/WSB are of a different breed. Most are willing to just buy and hold stock. Just buy and hold. The retail investors can hold far longer than the short-sellers/bears would like. Furthermore, according to the author, if these retail investors continue to buy and hold, a short squeeze is possible.  Please read this article and allow hope to fill your body. Damn right we're a different breed! Our tenacity and patience knows no bounds! We will buy and hold until we win! Either through a short squeeze or through the company turning successful under Ryan Cohen's leadership. Either way, we win! This is why we're diamond hand apes!   Also to the haters and OGs who keep saying that they're tired of GME threads/posts, I have a message for you. We're not going anywhere. Whine and bitch all you want but you best get used to ignoring our threads. The first share I bought in my entire life has been these GME shares. I invested my entire life savings in BANG gang! I'm down 80% on my investments and I will not cut my losses. For one thing, if I cut my losses, I won't have money to invest in any other stocks. Second, my mama didn't raise no quitter! To the diamond hand gang, don't lose hope!
Let me tell you about my weird ass dream from last night that relates to GME in a positive way. I swear to God this is not me memeing but I chose the meme flair anyway because I'll probably be wrong.
I'm telling you guys first, but I had a dream last night where I was desperately picking some things off the ground yesterday and then suddenly I was literally dragged upwards (like my whole body was reversed forcefully).   Even though I don't think about my dreams too often, I truly believe that my dream is a sign of the inevitability of GME mooning this week. I've always believed in the inevitability of GME mooning to greater heights than the ones already reached (that's why I didn't sell).  The shorts (me picking up things desperately from the ground) already know that they're fucked, and you can already guess what getting dragged up forcefully means (us apes buying shares).  In the case that I'm correct, I'm a fucking sage. In the case that I'm incorrect, I can just laugh it off in the end with you guys.  The dream was fucking weird and I needed to write about this.   TLDR:                                                           🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕     🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕    🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🍣🌕🍣🍣🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕
Brass Balls
Sell?? Look, if you were a door to door salesman, would you have this attitude?  No.  You need brass balls. You need to keep knocking on doors and hawking those bibles and vacuum cleaners.  Obviously, if you sell, you lose out on any gains you might make in future. Do you really want to live knowing what might have been? You can always just make more money by donating blood and semen.  Selling means you are saying "No" to the future, you are letting the past define you.  Holding, and even buying more, says "Yes" to the future. It says "Yes, I can do what I want! I am in control!"  BRASS BALLS - DIAMOND HANDS!
I wrote a song specifically for everyone at WSB holding $GME. I Like This Stock!
Been real
Long time lurker here
Hi, I've been lurking around on this subreddit for a long time. I think it's finally time to post on how I see the whole situation. I've noticed changes on this subreddit. This subreddit used to be a lot of loss porn. People actually wanted other people to do what ever the fk they wanted. So all the people telling you to sell are definitly not the real wsb community. So to give you some more pushback. Hold... if you hold and it does go down your lossporn will be better to share. If you hold like a proud ape and it goes up (which it will) we will go to the moon and in 20 years your loss porn will be even better.  TLDR Don't trust people who tell you to sell Hold you darn monkeys. 🤚🤚      Obligitory: not financial advise  Just a long time retard.
Started with 12k in September. Sold my GME in increments all the way up to 450 and made 200k. Current position, CRSR 1800 shares.
Watch virgin people. Don't let hype take away from opportunity.
GME Calls and Puts expiring Friday, Feb 12
Just keep holding!
You guys know that day traders are still making money every single day on $GME, right?
And they don’t care if the stock is $350 or $50, they are making money either way. This stock is still highly volatile and day traders are making a killing.  Take the price action Monday and Friday last week:  Monday 2/1: open at 290, dip to 212, up to 255, dip to 226, up to 277, dip to 240, up to 260, dip to 232, up to 240, dip to 230, up to 251, dip to 215, up to 226 to close out the day.  Friday 2/5: open at 57, dip to 51, up to 88, dip to 66, up to 75, dip to 62, up to 66, dip to 59, up to 65, dip to 57, up to 62, dip to 59, up to 62 to close out the day.  Day traders are staring at charts, buying low and selling high for a few hours each day. And again, the share price is IRRELEVANT. They go to bed each night holding zero GME stocks, then buying them the next morning all over again.  Imagine the price goes from 57 to 62, in the span of 18 minutes, while you hold 5000 shares.  Something to think about!    if you’re an experienced   position trader with    🏾 🤚 , probably none of this is new to you. If you’re someone who just got Robinhood last week and lost some money on $GME, this ones for you!
Please enjoy my loss story, featuring TSLA, shorting, options, one too many Negroni’s and my perfectly smooth ape brain.
Some of you may enjoy this, and writing it down will hopefully ease my pain a bit. It’s nothing earth-shattering, but my sheer stupidity still bugs me.  Last year in mid-Sep I felt super smart buying 100 shares in TSLA at ~440$ and selling a deep out of the money call at my take profit target of 510$ for mid-Dec expiry, which gave me 3000$ (plus another 1000$ for selling a put for the same date also deep out of the money ~200$).   Move ahead two months and it’s a late evening in mid-Nov: I am in Asia so live US trading is late nights. Had a great night ending up with my special Negronis that made me extra positive and (at least I thought) alert.  Before bed I checked the stock and at ~400$ I had lost around 4000$ on the stock, but the call had reduced enough in price to be nearly worthless, so I was willing to buy it back and sell a new call, ie neutralize my stock loss on the options, hold the TSLA stock position, and perhaps make some extra cash on selling farther out dated and money call.  So I log on my brokerage account, see TSLA, click close position, skim but don’t really read, and click submit... aaaand that’s when my stock position vanished.  I had closed the wrong position.🤦🏻 Instead of taking profit on the shorted call, I had stoploss’ed the stock position. Ie now I had not only realized 4000$ in losses on the stock, I was also sitting on an uncovered short call.  After this disaster, I called it a night and just left the call where it was, telling myself it’s not so risky since the stock will not reach 510$ in one month, so I could just let my shorted options expire for free.  Fast forward a month later: stock is indeed not at 510$, but instead at 700$! I scramble and barely manage to close my call at 16k loss on a dip on expiry day.  1. I took a -4000$ loss on equity position by mistake. 2. By mid-Dec that position would have been worth +16k and by now has doubled. 3. I did this instead of buying back my call at 3000$ realized profit 4. Instead I kept that cursed now uncovered short call, which ended up costing me another -16k to close eventually.  So a 2-3month play with 44k invested that would have yielded already +20k plus by mid-Dec turned into -20k loss (with fees). It looks even worse now, since I of course would have kept the stock position going and get a new long dated far out of the money short call. 🤦🏻  The moral: don’t drink and trade (+my Negroni’s are awesome). Anyways, I’ll use that excuse, but my smooth lazy ape brain likely would have done so anyhow.  Edit:
It's time WSB got off Reddit.
Because so long as we're a subsidiary holding to this ridiculous Chinese-owned propaganda machine, this sub will be overrun with Lemmings, children, and garden-variety fucktards who will spam the boards with so much Karma-whoring and imbecility that the good posters--that is, the people who take the time to write quality DD's will simply get drowned out and bumped off the page, and there will be no incentive for them to put in the work ever again.  Let's take the good mods, our Autists who can code, and build a new Eden--this time, with standards.
Are you winning, son?
Hi WSB, resident mouthbreather here. I've been watching on the sidelines... barely have a clue on stocks and hedge funds etc... etc...  Heard about you fucking over WS, Robinhood stopping buying, some kind of attacks happening, and some rogue moderator(s).  But that's about it, whatever happened to the hedge funds, did they actually lose a ton of money in the end or what? Were you guys fucked over? Did the movement lose steam and become a meme? Did you win?  Anything happening now? Just a general dumbed down reply would be enough and appreciated.  Edit: I have never had replies this fast to any of my posts.  Edit 2: I just won "one of the most controversial posts of the last hour on all of Reddit!" Didn't even know that was a thing.  I knew that I was a mouthbreather, but does that elevate me to the rank of retard? Love you guys!
More than doubled my investments in the last year. 2 stocks, AMD and ROKU
You guys are coming back for me right??GME @ 240 HOLDING
Ban me for the GME hate speech, the sub needs to hear this
This subs greatest flaws reside in its failure to recognize when something is over. I remember this same thing in November with PLTR “we’re going to the moon on Monday”  PLTR opens down 20% “better load up it’s about to take off”  PLTR opens down 6%. And instead of the sub stepping back and saying: wow, this is not going the way I had hoped, there just becomes less and less posts about the play overall, until it’s utterly forgotten and branded in the WSB history books.  As a GME holder (avg. cost $91) I would love nothing more than for it to skyrocket back up to $450. I just do not see it happening. I think it’s time to retire the goat.  Hope I’m wrong.
That feeling when you make more in a day than your total annual   an engineer. I worked my ass off for four years in college so I could work my ass off every day to make this much over an entire  't have words to describe, except I fuckkin love WSB
SABR Is a great recovery play, and recently started to brake out if it's channel
TLDR; I like the stock. It's in a great position for the recovery, with high pent up demand for travel.  My Positions: Long 500 shares @ $ , and long (8) July 2021$12 calls @ $   They integrate, aggerate and serve up a large number of airlines, hotels, cruises, and railways for many large travel sites you love and know.  There's 3 major players in that space, they are the  second largest and gaining ground.     Video about  these 3:     On Feb 19 2020, pre pandemic - SABR traded at $ , 78% above it's closing price of Feb 5 2021. On Feb 4th 2021, SABR closed at $ , a price not closed above since the beginning of the pandemic - March 4, 2020. It has been trading sideways for awhile now in a channel, and is starting to see some traction and large prints in recent days. I think this is telling, and SABR will continue it's move upward from here. it briefly touched $  at Feb 5th open.  With 317M outstanding shares, the 62M shares short are not super significant, however, there is 102% institutional ownership, and demand for the stock will only increase as the recovery beings to show signs of really happening.  Recent 13F positions show institutional ownership of 410M shares, excluding the 13Gs. so uh, that's 40M more shares than shares outstanding, perhaps that's where the 60M shares shorted come into play also. Not to mention all the owners that aren't required to submit 13F forms. Not to mention call and put positions which I can't see. I know they can play with the dates they submit a bit here, I think overall it's positive data for the stock listed here.     They spent the pandemic upgrading their technology stack and appear to be hiring aggressively.  All in all, it appears we're on the path to recovering from the pandemic, with vaccines being pushed out, and a pent up demand for travel. This stock is in a great position that even if it only halfway fills the gap between today's close and it's where it was before the pandemic dive, you're still looking at a 40% upside from where it sits. I think that is extremely likely to happen in 2021.  This  is some type of academic research paper just prior to the pandemic I thought was interesting:     There are some other recent  analyst writeups that you can google  for as well.  My personal target is $16, by July options expiry, and then hopefully the rise continues to $20+ from there.
Made about $30k from GME, now I'm in the process of buying my first home. Highlighted the date I opened my first GME position and when I got out.
Maybe a little too hard. 5k -> 115k -> 25k. Could have ended worse, at least I can afford school now
Reddit users on the r/WallStreetBets forum tried to squeeze silver prices, but analysts say that isn’t what really   shit
Good job retards, Marc Andreesson is in trouble for calling us retards "retards"
Why I'm not leaving Robinhood. And why I hate/love Robinhood.
I was pretty pissed off when RH blocked buying of the meme stocks.  $GME, $BB, $NOK.  But for a different reason than most.  $GME:  I caught the train late.  4 shares.  Bought and sold in the same hour.  Made about $400.  (I'm shocked that people bought at $360.  I've bought some stocks at the top of the rollercoaster before.  But DAMN son, never have I bought a stock that was obviously nuts).  $BB:  Bought some, after seeing the noobs jumping all in.  I set up a stop-loss and my stock sold at a small loss.  If RH wouldn't have froze the stock my stop-loss wouldn't have triggered and I'd have $400 in profit.  $NOK:  Invested (repeat, INVESTED) in $NOK back in October when news broke about the deal with NASA.  Not selling this one for some time.  I have no idea why $NOK was even considered to be the same shit as $GME.     I was pissed at RH because my stop-loss triggered.  But only slightly.  I was really pissed off because I started the day off intending on buying a PUT $GME.  Cause the bubble was going to burst.  I don't think RH froze trading because of some conspiracy BS.  And I don't really care (because the game is rigged, always has been).  RH probably stopped the trading due to not having the assets to cover the trading.  Not to mention their servers fuck up all the time (they can't handle trade volume at a stupid level).     I'm switching my main broker over to WeBull.  (I opened up an account with the 4 month ago, just never used it).  The tools they offer and the trading hours are far better.  Downside, they don't offer trading for OTC stocks.  I'm staying with RH (why I love RH)    so I can gamble on shitty OTC stocks like $RYCE.   They offer instant deposit and settlement free.   The interface is good looking.   They are an American made company.   I can gamble on fake money.  Why I hate RH:    The platform always crashes (trade volume too high)   The app always resets my login time restriction with each update (I hate having to login after a 5min wait)  PSA for the 7 million new subs:    If you're triggered by words like Retard, you should probably leave.   If you don't know much about options, stay the fuck away from them.  (I dabble.  If you want to actually invest stick to stocks that pay dividends and have a good history/future.  If you want to gamble try pennystocks.  They are fun.)   If you have to ask:  Did I miss the train?  You have...   $GME is not going to rocket again.  Take the loss.   Don't buy the hype.  Exploit the hype.  $GME is not going to rocket again.  We got one up on the big dogs.  I always wondered if it would be possible to hype a stock so much that it would get to the level of $GME.  But, learned that directing the hive mind is like trying to heard cats.     The big dogs have already changed their strategy.  They will recover.     I've said it before and I'll say it again.  One day r/wallstreetbets will be banned at the federal level.     Other thoughts on RH stopping trading:    They stopped the use of margin for buying $GME and etc.  Which is something that actually did protect the end users.    If the buying frenzy continued their shitty servers would have gone up in flames.  Happens every time a stock goes crazy.   This was not a freeze on trading for a moral reason.  (legit reasons to freeze trading, example:  Lukin Coffee)
SNDL DD - 2/6/21
Sundial is a Canadian cannabis company 🌱 that has shown a lot of bullish trends lately. I wanted to share some DD as recent technical and fundamentals bullish trends have developed:  • SNDL management team effectively manages its cash balance 💵 through registered offerings. The Company has ~$600M in cash with essentially no debt. This means they are poised for strategic growth with low liquidity risk.   • Political and Macro trends are favoring legalization in the US (~25B  annual market opportunity by 2023) with legalization being brought to the senate we can potentially see this market open up for SNDL by 2022-2023.   • GWPH was just acquired by Jazz Pharma for ~$7B - companies and investors are taking notice that cannabis is not just recreational, medicinal market is massive. 🌎  • If the company retains above ~$1 for ~5 days then it meets listing requirements for NASDAQ, super bullish signal. 📈  • The call to put ratio is 5:1. Literally 5 calls for every put being bought. This is super bullish because the buying interest will continue to rise.     • Investors are hungry for this stock, even with the outstanding shares recently issued; they barely made a dent in the stock price. 🤤   Speculation: 45M shares were traded on Friday in two seconds (2/5) this was either a massive buyer coming in or a massive short position being covered. Regardless, some whales have taken notice. 🐳 🌱📈  I'm all in here, ~500 shares + over $1000 invested in long dated calls .05-1 strikes. $5 PT (200% increase) by EoM.  Edit: THANKS FOR THE GOLD! :)  Edit 2 (2/10/21): I'm getting a lot of requests asking if you should buy SNDL. Here's my response: I'm invested for the long run, I've been buying every dip and will continue to do so going forward. I'm officially upgrading my Price Target from   $5 > $13.
Laughing stock of the family after this. Feels great, man.
Bloomberg: Robinhood Traders Have a Troubled Track Record of Stock Picking
Back in May, a Reddit poster hit WallStreetBets with a sure-thing tip on Scorpio Tankers Inc. The oil shipper, trading at one-fifth the value of its assets, was a screaming buy with storage rates soaring, insiders leveraging up and oil vaulting back after briefly going negative.     There’s an opportunity to see “100% returns within the next year,” the user said.     Eight months later, the reward: a 17% loss.     Another WallStreetBets poster was similarly breathless about their bright idea to short Tesla Inc. in 2018. The outcome: a 1,330% loss, not including borrow fees, assuming they stuck with it.     Picking stocks is hard. Almost nobody has an edge, and it’s no mark of shame when a call fails to pan out.     But in all the hagiography being bestowed on Reddit traders who latched on to GameStop Corp. before it rocketed skyward, it’s worth remembering that a big enough   of predictions will always yield a few winners. Evidence of investing genius elsewhere is hard to find.     It is these cautionary tales on stock-picking that are documented in research covering this era of WallStreetBets. A new paper finds that on average when retail traders on Robinhood Markets buy a stock, it doesn’t perform better over the next three to 20 days.     In fact, it tends to do a little worse.     A speculator's record trading GameStop would depend on their timing  “Robinhood investors’ evident lack of skill in aggregate is consistent with commission-free investors behaving as uninformed noise traders,” wrote Gregory W. Eaton and Brian S. Roseman from Oklahoma State University and T. Clifton Green and Yanbin Wu from Emory University.     The authors also found that stocks with buzz on WallStreetBets see a spike in activity on Robinhood a few days later, a sign there’s likely much overlap between the two communities.     To isolate investment skill, the academics adjusted 2020 returns for recent price moves and risk factors like valuations and the size of a company. The upshot: When you strip out the possibility that these traders are simply chasing market trends, they don’t actually end up picking future winners.     The results don’t mean retail investors across all brokerages are bad stock pickers. In fact, the four scholars found that increased buying of a company’s shares by the group overall did predict higher future returns. The problem for the Robinhood contingent is that they typically pile onto a stock nearly a week after the bulk of their peers.     “Although retail traders in aggregate appear to invest in the same types of securities that are popular among Robinhood investors, we find that the broader measure of retail trading leads Robinhood trading by several days, which may help explain the difference in performance,” the authors wrote.     The research covers only the first eight months of last year because Robinhood stopped publicizing the number of users holding each stock in August.     To be fair to Robinhood, it seems likely the pattern is not limited to their platform. Another paper has shown smartphones in general make people more likely to buy risky assets and chase past returns -- partly because apps allow them to trade in the evening without thinking too much.     Bragging Rights  As the GameStop rally comes back to Earth, the new research may offer a gut-check to amateurs whose bragging rights over the past week reached fever pitch.     Yet plenty of them would take issue with its conclusions, given how many in this new investing generation appear to have minted fortunes while besting hedge funds -- largely empowered by zero-commission trading platforms.     When markets were lashed by Covid in the roughly six months through July 2020, a portfolio comprising the most popular stocks on the Robinhood app returned an annualized 105%, according to Wolfe Research.     GameStop Corp., the poster child of retail speculation, is still more than 238% higher this year even after its recent plunge. Throw in Sundial Growers Inc. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., and the Robinhood crowd would seem to have several stories of incredible success.     The phenomenon remains relatively young, so firm conclusions about the stock-picking skills or otherwise of those involved might be premature. And to the speculators who have reaped profits on these platforms, it may not matter much whether it was down to picking winners or following the momentum of the market.     The success of retail traders in general has been documented by various academics across different time frames and methods. In a paper last year, Ivo Welch, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, showed a portfolio of common Robinhood holdings beat market benchmarks and a quant factor model in the two years through mid-2020.     Welch’s work focused on stocks widely owned by users, rather than those seeing an increase in buying on the platform. The recent paper focused squarely on whether more purchases from the Robinhood crowd actually led to superior performance -- or not.     “Our evidence suggests that zero-commission investors in aggregate behave as noise traders, with changes in Robinhood ownership being unrelated to future returns,” the academics wrote.
Why in long on MNKD
(credit to u/yoyo_mas_cousin)  Years ago, while holding a true medical breakthrough MNKD who has an amazing inhaled insulin, they would naked short sell the stock daily for years and always coordinated dumps of fraudulent shares with hit piece media articles that would be used to justify the dumps. They pretended that A led to B and it was all a natural process, when in reality naked short selling planned the news drops which were always filled with BS FUD. Seeking alpha was a primary culprit but many others got in on the game.   There used to be a true hero who automatically made charts of all the failure to deliver information that was easily searchable (from SEC data) and you could see clearly the carnage they were not only bringing to MNKD but other favourites they used to attack.   Difference with GME is enough people figured it out before they could bury the stock under 90% losses and demoralize everyone in to selling for pennies on the dollar.   Sirius satellite radio was the poster child for this process, and I believe it was the mercer family who picked it up around 10 cents a share, down 95% plus. The naked short selling rule was called the "madoff exception" because Bernie madoff helped get the rule in place "to help provide liquidity to the market"   Since then, the markets have been completely rigged, and it doesn't matter how many shares are bought of a company the price will always go down. They just need to sell more shares at any point to overwhelm the buying. GME should issue a special dividend if they really want to catch these short sellers flat footed, that seems to be the only real weapon against this fraudulent enterprise.   MNKD still kicking after all these years and seems to be finally winning the war, but the majority of shorts already closed out after whacking the stock 95%+. Good luck traders, always check to see if your stock is a Wall Street darling or a Wall Street target, the little guy can't swim up stream.

Revisiting My Favorite 馬: $PDD
$PDD, or PinDuoDuo, is the stock that I like more than any other stock on the market based on fundamentals and macroeconomics. I will try to keep this short for fellow retards and I will also share why I could be wrong to keep things fair and balanced.  Keep in mind, since Wall Street thinks we are all dumbasses, this stock is likely to go down after I write this post. If it does, I will most certainly be loading up on more stock and a lot more options.  Edit: two months ago, I wrote about a PT for PDD of $180 that the mods removed, but the stock skyrocketed right after earnings. I was right then. I'm right again.  # What is PinDuoDuo  PinDuoDuo is an ecommerce company in China founded in 2015 by a former Google software engineer. The company is pioneering the concept of social ecommerce, an idea that product discovery is best facilitated as recommendations from people in your network. Most product discovery on the web today is driven by searches on the web, so this a novel business model.\  Th company also pioneered a group buying function whereby customers that can get more people to buy with them can get further discounted prices for goods. Until somebody whined about it, PinDuoDuo was the best place in the world to buy a Tesla.  \ \     By the numbers:    Market Cap Today: 221 BillionMarket Cap August 2018: 19 BillionRevenue Growth Reported Last Quarter: 89% YoYMost Recent Report of Active Buyers: 737 MillionAlibaba Daily Active Buyers: 757 Million Active UsersRevenue: RMB   BillionFirst Ever Profitable Quarter: Last Quarter (FY2021Q3)Internet Penetration in Rural China: Grew 13% from March 2020 to June 2020. It's over 50% and growing, there by growing the PDD SAM, or serviceable addressable market.  Some might argue that they have grown too fast, but let's take a look at few key factors.       is a major holiday around the corner, February 11-17. $PDD has played a key role in practically every single holiday in China. Single's Day was even a huge success for the group buying platform because singles grouped together to give each other gifts for being single. I know for a fact that we can emphasize with those users as a community. This year, I will be buying valentine's day gifts for my wife's boyfriend, and all my friends in similar circumstances will do the same.  On a serious note, the Chinese New Year has begun. It has historically been the largest periodic people migration on the planet. Due to Covid fears and other factors, many families will not get together this year if they live in different cities. For China, that usually means there will be a fuck ton of  food purchased to fill plates that don't have eaters hovering over them. That's the tradition. There will also probably be some gift buying happening for citizens that cannot travel as expression of concern. PinDuoDuo's recent move into agriculture will likely spell historic gains for the business in terms of revenue growth, but also in terms of user acquisition.  2. PinDuoDuo international growth is quietly accelerating. They don't talk about much and I don't totally understand why.   for cross-border social commerce. The retail market for overseas Chinese with family in China is well in the Trillions RMB. Wall Street just missed here.  3. PinDuoDuo dominates in China's 2nd and 3rd Tier cities.  , while PDD increases penetration there anyway. Seeing as China is posted the best performing economy of any of the major economies by far, it seems that this fact is more important than the market has realized.  4. Amazing technology. Here is where I laugh my ass off at the Morningstar's of the world. They don't know shit about how hard it is to build good software. PinDuoDuo's software has an amazing track record and they are very focused on improving the customer experience constantly. Customer experience is the differentiator for the business.  5. Not a short squeeze you have to catch the run up or any of that. I like the stock for several years. I expect the company to be the largest retailer in China, the world's second largest retail market and growing rapidly, by the end of 2021.  6. Gradually reducing the cash burn from marketing spend. The reason why PinDuoDuo has only posted a single profit is because of the need to quickly acquire customers in a very competitive and fast growing market. Their reliance on marketing spend is dropping rapidly as they start to win more and more customers through brand loyalty and reputation. Their product is very sticky, social, and nurtured by social network density. We can expect a monster earnings report of 3/10.  My Bullish Price Target: $375  I am basing this on an aggressive revenue multiple that compares their 3-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) with the other leaders in the market. Keep in mind that their 5 year is not available because they haven't even been public that long. The three year figure for them is a monstrous   290%  . If their product catches on in other markets in Asia and parts of the west, we could see that number skyrocket. I hope for them to buy successful brands in other markets, swap the technology for their own, and further improve their recommendation engine's moat with the troves of data they have for operating these systems. If they can penetrate, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Oceania, damn son. My PT is too low. If not, I expect the Chinese market to drive enough growth that this figure is a reasonable price target on a \~45x multiple. Shopify gets this multiple and isn't even as cool. I expect them to partner with mobile device manufacturers and brands to bring a more integrated experience to market over the next few years. The tier 1 city growth also  paints a bright future for the prospects of the stock.     My Bearish Price Target:  $235  The Chinese market is red hot and due for a cool down. While I think that such a turn is unlikely in the short term, there are some challenges that operating in Chinese pose for fast growing businesses. Some unknowns for me include the regulatory landscape on personal information and how much data  can be used to power personalized experiences for your users. My limited research has suggested that this is not a problem in China like it is in the EU or the Americas, but the right to be forgotten is growing traction globally. There may be some movement in China for reform, though it seems unlikely, that challenges the ability for PinDuoDuo to generate such high quality recommendations. I cannot see the company growing substantially over the next six months for any reason short of a war or political unrest. During the brief period of unrest in the US, the stock market climbed. In closing, if they continue to grow in the tier 1 cities, their reputation for fake/counterfeit products means that they will likely falter at key growth opportunities. Since stocks go up, they gain 30-40 $'s a share on a bad year by my estimation.  Positions:  \~$100 C Jan 22     \~$250 C Jan 22  If I hit my bullish price target, I will probably only exercise the options and hold for an Amazon ten years because that is very fast growth. I would likely want to take profits on the $250 to wait for a pullback to buy even more options because my bullish target is right for the next two years or so. If we hit the bearish target over the next few months, and only barely get in the money by the time we get into the expiration date, I will likely exercise all options because what a steal. I know the stock will be at $375 in no time.  Embarrassingly, I dropped a lot of shares to join the mega-fucking-obvious GME/AMC short squeezes. Holding those stocks until capital gains at this point.  I still have $270 and $100 call options for next year purchased quite a while ago. I will be entering more options plays for the June earnings over the course of the next several weeks. I will be happy to post those positions here as I acquire them. I am not a technical investor. I invest on macroeconomic trends that impact companies and I am doing quite well. I am also not a financial advisor and do not know shit, but I am very hopeful about the growth prospects of this company. I like this stock.  More Sources:         \    \ \  As a disclosure, I am extremely long $TSLA as well because of very obvious growth prospects and several technological and data moats. Also, big fan of Musk.
THE NEXT BIG PLAY - UP Fintech Holding (TICKER: TIGR)
Fellow autists,     I present to you, UP Fintech Holding:   TICKER:   TIGR     Let's get this out of the way now...   TL;DR:   TIGR -->   🏻👨‍    📈📈📈💰💰💰       Positions:             Obligatory: I am not a financial advisor. I am retarded and I know nothing. Do not listen to me.     Personally, I invest first and  then  do my DD after. Why you ask? Well, I am retarded.

RECENT INSTITUTIONAL BACKING FROM A NOTORIOUS SHORT SELLER:       On February 2, 2021, Kerrisdale Capital who has a reputation for making "successful bets against Chinese internet companies, came out with a long position in" TIGR, calling it "The Robinhood of China."  .     Now, I know what you are thinking: FUCK ROBINHOOD. I absolutely agree. The mass fraud that they perpetrated on the retail market with GME, AMC, BB, etc. is an absolute travesty. But the point here is, TIGR has insane revenue and user growth and is continuously expanding its business according to available data and information. It's platform is user friendly and is attracting a lot of attention from retail investors, institutional investors, and start up companies seeking to go public via an IPO.       CONCLUSION:       TIGR is the next big trading platform that global, individual and institutional investors are showing an increasing interest in. It has the potential to continue its growth trajectory based purely on its impressive numbers, which speak for themselves.     Also, I believe TIGR will continue to gain international interest in light of the recent media spotlight on retail trading. Interestingly, the "government mobility restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have helped fuel a surge in online trading . . . ."  .       SUMMARY:   Getting into TIGR now is like getting in on sunlight before there was fucking sunlight.       TL;DR AGAIN:   TIGR -->   🏻👨‍    📈📈📈💰💰💰     Sincerely,     Lieutenant
I broke my daily gain record with GME
$ELY might be a solid play post earnings.
Callaway Golf is the leading brand in golf products, they have solid fundamentals and are poised to continue being the top dog in the golf game. They are also profitable, with a profit margin in Q3 of over 11%. Cyclically Q4 has always been bad so I can see a dip buy after earnings. ( see their 2019 Q4 for reference )  Their Q3 income was   million, I don’t expect Q4 to be that strong and it’s very possible that they post a - EPS due to Q4 and the start of Q1 being the “off season” for golf (unless you are a boomer in retirement who lives in Florida). the golfing industry is a 80+ billion dollar industry and $ELY is poised to continue to capture the lions share of money that is spend on non venue purchases. Sporting and recreation will see more people as we exit COVID, and I predict a great year for the company after earnings on the 10th. This stock has the ability to grow to 38$ a share by the end of the year. Buying golf balls, and clubs is a necessity to golf, you can’t play without them. (Unless you get creative). Every time someone shanks a shot into a pond $ELY has the chance to sell another golf ball. For every new young businessman who has to go golfing with his boss for the 1st time that’s a new set of clubs that get purchased ( or rented if the venue offers that ). As long as the game grows, which it is,( rounds of golf logged in 2020 increased by almost 20%, and female interest in the game has started to pick up ) I see this company steadily growing.    $ELY also has a dividend that is poised to grow, it’s extremely small right now but that will most likely grow long term. The only red flag I see with this company is it’s   billion $ worth of debt.  Disclosure: 5 shares at 27$ each   This is not financial advice, just a guy who likes whisky typing stuff.  UPDATE: Bad Q4 earnings like I assumed, stock dipped and I think it will recover in the next few months.
Yield curve data. GLTA
DID WE ALL FORGET THE DTC SCREWED US? ROBBERY!! True and false NARRATIVES!!!
The deposit trust and clearing corporation literally jacked up collateral rates to 100% out of nowhere for every single   told them to do this? How did they determine this? Did anyone know about this?  Fake Narrative: We weren't smart enough to get out, we were bag holders, we didn't know the stock market, etc etc. ITS ALL YOUR STUPID FAULT.  Real Narrative: The DTCC demanded large ransoms from brokers and if they couldn't pay then they couldn't buy shares. So the brokers shutdown buying trades and the stock went down. They robbed us blind right before the squeeze happened. Literally illegal robbery. I say we subpoena the dtc and find out who and what and how and why they can arbitrarily determine collateral rates to brokers to the point they can shut down entire stocks!!!!  I   we supposed to accept that anytime a hedge fund gets short squeezed they can just keep doubling down until they win or if they are losing they can just call up the DTCC and have them demand ransoms from brokers?  UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!
Some really loss porn. 182k to 30k. No words. STILL HOLDING.
An honest question for all you    autists out there:
With your    Diamond Hands, how do you realize your profits? You can't make actual gains until you sell.  Who would buy your $1,000 GME shares when you're ready to sell? Honestly, you all keep saying "$1,000 is the goal". Well then, who would buy at that level, knowing it's going to tank immediately after? For a sell to occur there has to be a buyer.   If $1,000 is the ultimate goal of this sub, who are you counting on to buy your shares?
Just some shares of gme from $38 to $345. Kept the party rolling a bit last week with some other plays.
Thank you WSB, 28 and debt free. TSLA 5k -> 19k , GME 19k -> 97k, what’s next :)
Seen a lot of bots, seen a lot shills, seen a lot of people telling bag holders to sell. If you’re not a bot and this is what you’re doing you’re going to help in having your options trading abilities revoked. This goes for those of you who are commanding people to buy as well....
The SEC (EDIT NOT SEC, SECRETARY OF STATE (Mass.)) is considering (EDIT; ARGUING) limiting options trading for retail investors and if all of you smooth brains (who aren’t bots) keep telling people to “sell, you fucking retard” you are advocating for ALL OF US to lose our ability to trade options. Yes, that means YOU won’t be able to buy puts against retards who bought into GME at $350 like me okay? You wont be able to buy option calls for stocks you like that you feel have been t  by GME hype.   So what’s the point? Who the fuck cares? We all SHOULD care. This place used to be a space for people to post loss porn, gains, plays, ideas, and DD for people to react however they did. Suddenly this turned into a space where everyone seems to be my financial advisor and I just want it to go back to people calling eachother idiots, NOT telling someone “you should sell now, if you don’t you’re actually retarded” OR “buy this stock right now tO tHe mOoN” or worse, “EVERYONE BUY AT 1pm” which is illegal. Wtf happened here??? If you want to hold and tell everyone you’re holding GREAT!! Post your loss porn or your gains a month from now so i can laugh or cry about it, fuck. If you are that chad who’s been on crusade financially advising retarded apes to sell over the past two weeks please PLEASE fuck off. If you are a retarded ape advising retarded apes to buy at a given time, please fuck off or go to college and join a hedge fund so you can do that which is illegal legally. Cheers happy holding, happy shilling, happy shwacking whatever is you want to do do it happily please and stop whining BOTH SIDES.  - edited post to omit SEC reference this was my mistake, I am retarded
Went to sell multiple times.. but with everyone else holding I couldn't do it 😭. Hello fellow retards
UPDATE: GameStop short squeeze fuels new stock-market services tracking Reddit messages
Loss porn. $91k to $18k in 1 week. Went all in on GME. Still holding the line with these diamond hands. Ape together strong
Is $60 a fair price for GME if abusive shorts or Diamond Hands never happened?
My strategy is to try to dollar cost average down as close to $60 long term as possible (I'm around $95 a share right now). I don't really know how to value GME without all this chaos going on around it, but I think $20-60 might be fair?  Since it seems whatever market forces (lmao) are moving the price right now wants it to stay between $60-$70 I don't think it will go down below that unless a mass selloff happens for some reason. If it does I think I should have at least 25% left over to invest to bring the average down closer to maybe $40 if it goes really south.  I'm new to evaluating a company from fundamentals, I only understand market mechanics well by this point. Is this price range a resonable assumption? What do you think about my investment strategy?
New term come Monday “ Margin Call”

AMC DD - Bullish Signs (Short Squeeze Potential)
DD Copied from       TL;DR: Low risk, high reward.  On Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow the same exact pattern. While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.  Reason: More shorts.  Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:        Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?  On Friday, GME opened at  , and AMC opened at    GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around    3% of   is .2151. In other words,   - .2151 is    10% of   is   In other words,   +   =    So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?  13%.  The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?  13%.  For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.  GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \ started\  it's rise in the aftermarket.     GME is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive, and there's more volume to play around with.  However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,        Yahoo Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as "Neutral" despite the amount of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term. People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is neither stock dead in the water yet? Why do both stocks show more resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?  People shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily. Everyone is waiting until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can make "easy money".  Consensus: Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum that GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME because they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike wasn't relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point, AMC's shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype). If the momentum dies, then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this stock are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price for months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of having to pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the people shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck off.  Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?  $AMC.
My hopes for GME
Hi all, this is just my opinion, not advice, don't take it seriously. I like GameStop and am holding 26 shares purchased at an average price of $100, some bought at $21, some at $218.  I think three things need to happen for $GME to go up   .  First, the business has to show improvements. The most crucial factor to convince a    that he/she should not be bearish is business' growth in customers, services, cash flow, profit, whatever else that can be counted as a good thing. There are many good things going for GME now in terms of new talent in the team, new consoles, all this hype, etc., so I look forward to seeing improvements that tear down the bear theory.  Second, obviously, shareholders need to hold the shares 🤚   and buy the dips. Moreover, I think community involvement can help: from visiting the store and buying some goodies from them, to sharing good experiences on social media, all the way to reaching out to the leadership of the company and telling them about what is bad and needs to improve (constructive feedback). Papa Cohen, if you read this, I want free shipping on orders above $25 please!  Third, also obviously, the shorts covering their shorts should drive the price up. I strongly believe that this will not happen just because it hurts them in their vaginas. Remember Elon and how he had to invite (literally call out) the head of a fund that was shorting TSLA to visit the factories and see with his eyes that things are for real? Shorters stopped shorting TSLA when they and their clients stopped being    about it, and not so much because they were bleeding money.  TlDr: This fight can be about big money fighting many retards' small money. But big money's position will weaken when they see there are actually good reasons to be long on GME.

$WWE. Can you smell what the stock is cookin?
Disclaimer: this is my first time actually writing out a DD. I don't know how to add pictures and charts and what not.  That aside, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN BROTHER  Ok, so, $WWE. World Wrestling Entertainment. The shit that nobody has watched since Stone Cold was beating the fuck out of Vince and Kurt Angle was drenching Vince's daughter with white, creamy milk.  The company is not doing great right now. COVID and wrestling do not mix at all. In 2019, WWE had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds. In 2020, they had 42. Q4 earnings fell 26% from Q4 2019. Revenue was   million, EPS of 16 cents. Pretty well below expectations. Now, that shouldn't be all that shocking, nobody can go see the shows. So this is a rebound play, obviously.  So here's the good. Starting with Wrestlemania in March, WWE will begin having limited amounts of fans in attendance. By year end, I'd think there is a decent chance at full attendance events. Maybe, I don't know.   Having full houses soon is the obvious recovery angle, but even if houses aren't full, here's something to consider: WWE on the year as a whole increased operating income to 208 million. Thats a nearly 80% increase from 2019. The bulk of that comes from a rise in content fees. The point here is that even with limited ticket sales, WWE is smart about bringing in money.  One of the less obvious angles is the new deal with Peacock. The WWE network is a big source of revenue for WWE, but its now being completely migrated to Peacock Premium/Peacock ad free. WWE network has cost   per month forever and generally has a subscriber base of around 2 million. I don't know the details of what NBC Universal is paying for the WWE Network content (which includes every new PPV, every old PPV from WWE, ECW and WCW, and a huge catalog of original content), but what I do know is that as young as it is, Peacock already has more than 20 million subscribers. A lot of that may be free subscribers who won't get the WWE Network content, but assuming a quarter of them are paid subscribers and that 40% of WWE Network subscribers move to Peacock (very conservative), the WWE Network potential audience will reach 6 million people. And this is just a gut feeling, but if you're already paying for Peacock, why not tune in and catch a little bit of Wrestlemania? One of the undersold parts of this entire deal, I think anyway, is the potential for increased ad revenue. Now, Peacock offers an ad free subscription but WWE don't give a fuck. They have "commercials" during PPV events and advertise shit all through the show. Those advertisements could reach a lot more people now.  Now, here's the big one that a lot of people don't know about if you don't follow wrestling: the Saudi Deal. WWE is has an agreement to do two shows per year in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis pay 50 million per show. The Saudi shows obviously didn't happen this year, and WWE was not paid for them, it simply extended the contract until shows can resume. The agreement is for ten years.  Now, a hundred million dollars doesn't seem like a ton in the context of a publicly traded company, but considering that WWE raised its operating income, and I'm repeating myself, by nearly 80 percent to 208 million WITHOUT the expected 100 million from Saudi Arabia speaks pretty loudly.  Now, despite the pandemic troubles, $WWE has been trading mostly flat since COVID. It's at   now, down about 6-7 percent from Thursday close. It hit a low directly after COVID restrictions started at  , but rebounded 44 dollars within about a month. If I didn't mention it before, WWE revenue actually went up this year. A measly 1%, but given the obstacles it's faced I'd say thats actually impressive.   The timing of trying to play this one I really couldn't tell you. I think there's good room for growth in shares, but I wouldn't try playing weeklies on it. LEAPs I think could probably print you some money.  I'm gonna go ahead and just sort of close this out now cause I'm dumb and I don't know what I'm doing. I much prefer stealing DD from the people here smarter than I am but fuck it.   Fuck ape gang nobody is gonna see this shit anyway.  Edit: 10 1/21/22 65C
DD: Synopsys to the moon
Hello friends, it is your local cybersecurity investment friend. Today I wanted to provide a quick analysis on a company in the Cybersecurity sector that people haven't really noticed yet $SNPS (Synopsys).  Synopsys derives revenue from two main avenues, semiconductor and integrated circuit designs as well as software security. They also do consulting for both. Electronic Design Automation is 60% Revenue, Consulting is 30% Revenue, Security is 10% Revenue. With that cleared up, I'll reveal that my area of expertise is the software security arm of their business, but I'll write on both areas. I don't want to write about the consulting arm, because bodyshop businesses don't scale well so I think that part is supplemental NOT their core business despite 30% revenue.  # Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and Electronic Design Automation  Synopsys main focus is on developing software for companies to build Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and integrated circuit designs. They help customers design and test chips. They also have pre-designed circuits for licensing as components of larger chips. In addition, they also provide hardware and software verification/validation services for electronic systems.  I'm not a hardware guru, but as far as I am aware this area is highly competitive. Cadence and Siemens are breathing down Synopsys' neck for getting revenue from circuit design software and I don't see a TRUE competitve advantage. BUT it is not my area of expertise, so I defer that to hardware folk.  That being said, as we move towards Decentralised Finance I expect a significant increase in interest in running purpose-built hardware as a means to achieve new business needs. Digital Currency, machine learning, cloud computing, video processing, or even future automotive/vehicle circuits require custom-built, reliable, secure, and performant hardware. Synopsys is able to deliver on all these.  Supply chain risks are now elevated across all industries due to coronavirus and increasingly troubled international relationships. I expect a large focus on managing this risk from nation states by increasing domestic chip fabrication and design where cost-effective to do so. This is to avoid getting locked out of emerging technology by being unable to access chips, should China improve military and commercial routes in the South-China Sea / threaten Taiwans autonomy.  In addition, TSM, AMD, Micron, and Nvidia have seen dramatic share-price uplifts over the last year and I expect a rising tide to lift all ships. Synopsys is quite undervalued in this space and as a Domestic US design shop, I expect to see more interest in their technology offerings.  # Software Integrity  Cyber is a growing industry with a huge total addressable market. Here, I have seen investments in well-known or larger players like Fireeye, Splunk, CrowdStrike, and Cloudflare go well for friends here. Happy to go into more detail about each of these offerings at a later date, but for now let's go with Synopsys as a relatively low-traded stock.  Synopsys' Software Integrity business looks for vulnerabilities in software applications and helps developers fix them, hopefully early and cheaply before they get released into a production environment.  Within the Application Security / DevSecOps space, security tools tend to fall into sveral categories. I can't write their acronyms without Automoderator hating me though. Synopsys does a few of those.  1. Static Analysis - Look at code, find bugs, report. Static Analysis tools function in different ways. Some build normalised syntax tree's (computer science nerd shit, basically think of it as a translation of a book written in 34 languages to 1 language). Others simply grep for known bad words (ctrl+F print each line with that word). There are many open-source versions like semgrep and bandit available as well. 2. Software Composition Analysis - Look at the libraries used in your software for known security issues and provide guidance for fixing those. Generally, composition analysis isn't difficult from a technical perspective, and numerous open source tools exist like OWASP Dependency Checker, nodepackagemanager audit, and so on. 3. Dynamic Analysis - Run your software, then throw shit at it and see what breaks. Useful for quickly identifying areas that crash your app, or ones that cause weird behaviour, but not as effective as a penetration test because they can't cover business logic well. Owasp zed attack proxy is a good example, as well as Community Burp Suite.  # Why not use Open Source?  Enterprises often cannot use open-source security tools due to regulatory concerns around the security OR quality of the tools. Other aspects include lack of support contracts, having to manage it internally, lack of integrations with other enterprise systems, etc. While I have no issue with open source security tools, boards and executives clearly do due to the lack of risk transferral and the advantage of shifting accountability to vendors (See SolarWinds).  # Synopsys Value Prop  Security Vendors focus on having a broad enterprise security offering (Gitlab) or on building high quality but niche security tools (Thinkst Canary, Splunk, Snyk). Synopsys is the former, but over last few years have acquired two of the latter and then integrated them into their enterprise offering.  In the Static Analysis space, there are a few large enterprise juggernauts like Checkmarx, Veracode, Microfocus Fortify, and Appscan as well some smaller players. The general industry feeling is that each of these is cost too much, don't work in new environments, and are generally security compliance tools trying to fit into a devops world.  Synopsys Coverity in comparison was built with more focus on the developer experience. Developer satisfaction and cost generally trump security coverage in the app-sec space, so these ancient security product companies are failing. To illustrate, $MFGA which owns Fortify (a fantastic product from 12 years ago) currently has a 20% dividend at the moment. Not sure how they'll grow their share price or get further investment with a 20% div.  Unfortunately for Synopsys, with most enterprise security products, a stupid long contract has been signed w/ prior static analysis vendors mostly to keep Microfocus in business I guess. There are plenty of legacy static analysis deployments currently rotting in big enterprises so the total addressable market for Coverity is massive. This is assuming they are able to meet enterprise chief information security officers on the golf course.  # Technical Competitive Advantages:    Broad programming language support   Lack of mandatory compilation / builds reduces analysis time   Incremental analysis means you don't need to compile the whole application every time you want to run a scan.    Direct integration into integrated development environments helps developers find issues before committing code.   Lower false positive ratio, less noise is better for developer experience  Sometimes, people think adding features, more vulns types, extra integrations, etc makes for a more convincing product. I think that coverity, by simply being simpler with a  focus on the developer experience will win a lot of product bake-offs compared to competitors.  Another thing to note, these are long term recurring revenue licensing agreements. You won't get immediate bang for buck from these contracts, they are generally paid Month to Month and because of that, Synopsys has to wait for their coffers to fill over time.  # Blackduck composition analysis  Blackduck basically works the same as other composition analysis vendors, although there is a lot more competition now with WhiteSource and Snyk becoming increasingly active in their Developer user experience space. They were best in breed, but I can't confidently say that's true any more.  Composition Analysis is huge in the security world, validating the integrity and automatically reporting (and potentially fixing) supply-chain risks has a huge TAM. Software Engineers pull libraries from anywhere into their software application instead of writing the code themselves, inheriting the risk profile of that library AND the risk of it being maliciously modified. Blackduck addresses this by identifying software with weaknesses quickly, providing guidance, and by providing vulnerability research into potential malicious updates to packages.   I'm super bullish on all Composition Analysis products as I don't see Software Engineering moving in any direction except for additional code re-use over re-inventing the wheel.  BONUS: Another vendor in this space I'd consider to be promising would be JFrog for the same reasons as Synopsys Blackduck with the JFrog Artifactory Xray offering providing a similar service.  # Summary  \- Synopsys does two things, Chips and Software Security.  \- Synopsys according to their Jan21 Q4 report has been getting increasing revenue across both their Chip and Integriy business divisions despite supply chain disruptions and the covid pandemic.  \- Chips and manufacturing are a huge booming business, a rising tide lifts all ships.  \- Cybersecurity has a large total addressable market. Synopsys focusses on software security and made two large acquisitions over last 3 years. Both are high quality products with a focus on user experience and are now fully integrated into the holistic Synopsys enterprise offering.  \- Synopsys has been doing share buybacks over the last few years, which at least indicates to me confidence in their cashflow and longterm prospects.  \- Assets have improved Q32019 $  to Q12020 $  while liabilities Q32019 $  to Q12020 $  Revenue slight improvement, Q12019 830k > Q12020 860k DESPITE global pandemic disrupting entire world.  Bearish Factors:  \- High customer acquisition cost, Synopsys mainly targets whale enterprises, so banking/governemnt/military/etc.  \- Acquihired talent lockup ends 2022 for Coverity and 2023 for Blackduck, will see if they stick around.  \- One of their Principal Sales Engineers told me I was a good kid and bought me a coke instead of whiskey at a networking event. Boomers in sales positions :(    TL:DR Positions:   Synopsys does  chips and software security. Chip companies are mooning. Cyber is mooning. Why not both?  50 shares $SNPS @ $272.  EDIT: I have removed almost every acronym as I think automoderator hates them. Sorry for the lengthy post because of that.
Been a hell of a start to 2021. Thanks WSB
The Anatomy of a Coming Disaster.
Hi.  Some of you know me, some of you don't.  If you DO, I ask that you not shill for me in the comments below, so we can stay within the rules of this sub.  This post is for the newbies, it is written as such, if you already know what delta hedging is, this post isn't for you.  If you  don't , well, lads and lasses, this is for you.  We need to understand a few basic things here, and in keeping with the spirit of this post, we're going to keep it dead simple.  Market Makers (the big dogs behind the scenes, facilitating your yolos) DO NOT CARE if your options plays pay out for you.  They would be crazy to take on the level of risk that selling you an unhedged call or put would represent.  These guys make money in other ways.  So how can they not care?  Simple, they hedge.  Generally speaking, they buy enough shares when you buy a call so that even if you win hugely, they simply sell the shares they bought when you bought the call, and remain risk neutral.  (Edit, I've been asked to explain that market makers make money by recouping the difference between the bid/ask spread.  While this seems small, they do a LOT of it.)  Why does this matter?  Well, it matters because it introduces  leverage .  Which simply means it  the effect your money has on the stock market.    As an example of how this works lets makes up a company.  We'll call the ticker ABC.  And we'll say the share price is 10 bucks.   You, as a degenerate yolo artiste, only have 100 bucks to play with, and you think ABC is going to the mewn.    Now, you could do the boomer thing and just buy 10 shares of ABC (we'll call this scenario A), but a lifetime of minimum wage and renting a closet for 5k a month has done strange things to your risk management, so you decide to buy calls instead.  You go to whatever broker isn't fucking robinhood and take a look at your options - and there you see it.  For that SAME 100 bucks you can buy ten calls and leverage a hell of a lot more shares.   (We'll call this scenario B) So you do it, you buy the calls.  How does your choice effect the underlying stock?  In scenario A, you bought ten shares, you increased demand for the stock by 10 shares, and this does almost but not exactly nothing to the price.  In scenario B, you bought 10 calls, you made Mr. MM buy a lot of shares to hedge your bet, and you increased the demand for the stock by a much larger number of shares.  (This is an over simplification, but that's what we do here) Which does  something  to the share price.  Even if it's pretty small. (Edit, as I said, this was an over simplification but I've been asked to address it.  Market makers use a number of metrics to determine how many shares they need to hedge your bet.  It is a lot, but it is almost never 100 times your call options)  Now, if you're part of the "We like ABC stock" gang, and 20 thousand of you buy 10 calls... Well, I forgot my calculator, but suffice to say you've just invited market makers to buy a FUCK TON of shares.  Just this, without any actual change in earnings, outlook, of fundamentals on ABC, puts tremendous bullish pressure on the stock  for the term of the option   And THAT my friends, is the market we find ourselves in.  Talking heads on the news continue to talk about how "CraZy thE p/E raTiOs haVe bEcomE!!!"  Without mentioning what is actually driving this phenomenon.  Its options.  Specifically since March.    So with that I'll tell you something pretty goddamn spectacular.  The stock market has become a  derivative  of the options market.  Earnings don't matter, fundamentals don't matter, past performance doesn't matter. The OPTIONS matter.   This has happened before, in a very different way.  You know how there was a lot of noise in 08 about all the housing derivatives?  We're there again, except for instead of CDOs it's happening with with the shares of the biggest companies in the world.  Want proof?  Go look at 10 day spy chart, right now.  Then go look at a GME chart.  Look what happens to spy, tick for tick, as GME rises and falls. When the entire options meme market is focused on one ticker.  So what do we do about it?  Nobody knows.  I do know this, GME was only the  beginning .  Retail knows it has the bull by the tail now.  What happens when the stock market becomes a lagging indicator of the sentiment of retail bull chads?  I don't know, but it's going to be  spectacular .  Edit, much of the thinking around this post comes from months of conversation with a friend of mine.  She's pointed out since I posted this that she has written this up in a way 10 of us will understand in her latest blog post - which can be found here:
I'm feeling the need to point out the difference between covering and closing a short position.
Edit: What I describe below is called hedging. Covering and closing a short position are the same thing. Sorry for my mistake.  ~~  Covering   short positions does not equal   closing   short positions. Everyone doing math trying to prove that GME short positions couldn't have been "covered" seems to ignore, overlook, or not realize the difference. No one said they closed short positions, only that they covered.~~ They ~~cover~~ hedge using options (short puts and long calls), which can be anywhere from days to years in expiration, meaning they spread the demand over months, eliminating the squeeze, leaving only slow upward growth.  Edit: I am long GME and diamond-hand holding while I dollar cost average down and get ready for the long haul. This is just good info for everyone to have, not fodder for the    hype train.
For all my diamond hands out there, this one's for you
Losing money always sucks. As much as we joke about it, I know how terrible it feels. Bought GME and AMC near their highs like a true autist. Current loss (unrealized) is relatively tame for me, which speaks to just how much I've fucked up this past year. So I thought I'd make something   wholesome   for all my diamond hands out there.   Full 3 min video meme   of Sam's Speech from LOTR is here (WSB doesn't let me embed the full video in the post):    Honestly, the original speech does more justice than my captions. If Sam's words don't give you both life and make you weep as if you bought $800 OTM GME weeklies on Monday, then I'm not sure what will. Let me ask you, did Frodo let Sauron (Melvin in our case) get the one ring (our GME shares)? Ok, maybe he came close, but that's why he had his   gay diamond balled boyfriend Sam   with him to help him stay strong. Don't forget, you've got thousands (perhaps many more) of fellow Sams   holding the line   with you    .   Don't give in now.    We've gone through hell and back again, but the journeys not over yet.   We still gotta carry GME all the way to fucking Mordor.   Only then will we see the   mother   of all short squeezes, and all that's green and good in this world will be ours once again.  I know all you apes are experiencing market withdrawal this weekend, but hope you're relaxing. Watch some Lord of the Rings. It'll make you feel better.  Positions: 12 shares GME @ $ , 468 shares AMC @ $  Not much compared to some, but it's all I could afford. Please come back for me. Yes I know I bought near the peak. Did I mention I'm kinda retarded?

How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's   Million Outstanding Shares
EDIT: This post is meant as a mathematical (\~Middle School Algebra) exercise regarding GME stock and shorts. The title itself is meant to be the literal end as intended, and describes how it would be impossible for all shorts (estimated) to be covered, closed and completely done and finished, with only using the available outstanding shares on the specific days stated. Please note that I have made no comments on possible options that HF's can/did use as     I DO NOT HAVE THAT DATA!     I have, hopefully, labelled the assumptions I made to do these calculations, and pointed out some general assumptions,more shorts mean more gains, sarcastically, that do not always appear to be true in the given data.   # These are just general findings, so chill the fuck out!     Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA, Jan29th text file (   regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices.  I promise you the long read is worth it, but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9. The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached. Please help out if there are any huge oversights, or wrong calculations, in the comments below, as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver, or just shady as fuck.  Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME (source Yahoo Finance).     So as EVERYONE KNOWS, shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased, and with supply and demand, we aim for the heavens...     So let's do a quick sanity check. Looking at Figure 2, we see that on   Jan 13th, over 40 MILLION shorts were executed!   So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th, we should expect to see that the price increased, which it did.  Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day.     This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February, so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day.     Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.  So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.       NOW WE GOT A PLOT!   Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.  But what do we actually get from Figure 5?   Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS  , but we don't see that across the board though.....?  Jan 13th, Jan 22nd, Jan 26th, and Feb. 5th all show gains in price, and large number of shorts...    22 days I tracked, and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours, but only 4 days have gains of 20% or greater, and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50%.....?    # Eye Raise:      Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet?    \-"The screaming cries of wallstreetbets"  Hmmmmm, ok, well  maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts. The HYPE was/IS real over GME, and the world took notice. Let's see how the volume changed with it.  First, just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours.        Alright, what do we get out of this plot...? Well, from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF, compared to early January.    BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE?!?!?!?    I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January!? From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st, with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend.  # General Assumption I'M MAKING:  # Most of the actual "Retail Investors" didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd.        # So, ASSUMING, the above, let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney.  So what's with the crazy high volume before then? Is it from the insiders, the true chosen among us, the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots? -->NOPE.  Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on! The "big bois" had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000% short shares... maybe.  Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading... After Hours Volume.       I DO LOVE PLOTS!!!!   Here, I've taken the regular hours volume(again from FINRA) and subtracted it from the day's total volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance, to get the After Hours Volume. But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot?  # After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd, and has remained where MOST of the action is going on!    GENERALLY  , "Retail Investors" don't/CANT engage in after hours trading. And also, don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker-dealers and big bois are doing at 2am.  We see around Jan 13th, after hour volume went above 50million, my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts, and the few following days thereafter.  Hmmmm. OK, let's take a step back and look shorts again....        Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume, just during regular hours, are shorts.   I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts, if so PLEASE COMMENT IT!!!!!!    # And because I can't get after hours short volume, we have to make a wild guess as to this next step.  # So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get.....     # NOTE: Figure 9 is an estimate, but it's still a low-ball estimate.    ASSUMPTION --> Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading.    I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75% of just shorts.  Still, let's roll with Figure 9.   Looking at Jan 13th, we estimate the number of shorts executed   76 MILLION!      And there are....   shares outstanding... yep... ok... checks out!         TLDR: Go to Figure 9, NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE(and a low one at that), and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts (ON THOSE DAYS) see edit below.       Not financial advice, not advocating violence, not legal advice, just doing some math while my wife and her boyfriend watch The Crown.  Edit 1: Yes, title is a typo. "  WE ARE Covered..." smh  Edit 2: finra link seems to break for some with the https:// in the front, try it without and added direct links to text files. Also, no I did not include ways to cover shorts with options/bought/sold/traded/fails-to-deliver/NoExpirationShortsJustPayInterest/t+3/etc.... since I already threw a god-awful amount of text at you and literally pointed to exact dates and I don't have Bloomberg/L50Data...

$MVIS Gains Porn. Not Too Late!
GME 27k --> 121k (Gains #2)
This is the second of several mysterious GME gains post (previous one I just did was from the 'ol boomer central 401k) that keep popping up from my different accounts.  A lot of this has been re-invested (AHAHA "re-invested" -- I can't even keep a straight face when I type that) into further downstream losing positions half of which are in the red.  I expect to lose ALL $300k+ gains from GME by the end of next week if my calculations are correct.         But then we don't go to Binion's Horseshoe to make money - - we go there to chat with meth-head waitresses and play nickel slots while doing blow in the stair well
$CLOV the play we need
Many of you are like me and held GME too long and saw most of our ungodly gains evaporate in a matter of days. Big whoop, that’s life. Maybe you’re still holding based off the fantastic DD’s about sHorT LadDeR aTtAcKs and ThE SqUeeZe iS NoT sQuOzE. If you are, good for you, you stuck to your guns and you might end up being right. Maybe you sold at the top and are trying to “save” everyone still “bagholding”. No matter which person you are I don’t care, no one cares. Now shut up so we can move onto new plays that may get our wives to look at us again and out of their boyfriends bed. We’re here to make money.  So Clover Health, they use machine learning to personalize the Medicare experience for each specific patient to lower healthcare costs through improved decision making. Their growth is tied to virtuous cycles (positive feedback loops) by using improving machine learning to continuously lower costs over time. Currently CLOV annual growth rate is 38%. Hindenburg recently released a negative report on the company that brought down the stock price 15% in the past few days, but it’s started to turn around Friday. It’s down from it’s all time high of $  Could be a good buying opportunity.  Anyone who knows more about the company have any further insight? I got in on the dip on Friday.   Positions: 100 shares @   ; 10 12/17 $  calls  TLDR: talk about things other than GME. CLOV seems like it’s in a position for positive growth and could be a good play to buy the dip on.
$SLV This is the Way (  allowed)
Listen up you retarded self righteous   gang hipster zoomers.... physical silver is the Squoezzeeee that GME failed to have. They have been suppressing paper silver and gold for FAR TOO LONG. We must do something about this!    Read this (reasons to squoozeeee)    And then read this from CEO of APMEX on the current state of physical bullion demand! It’s off the charts!     Boys this puppy is ready to blow. Take your GME EARNINGS or your failed profits and go buy some damn physical silver bars and then go buy leap options in $SLV I’m sitting pretty with 21 JAN 22 $35 calls  I’m telling ya.... $SLV GANG IS THE FUTURE    SQUIZZEEEE THESE BASTARDS     together strong! You can buy bananas with your physical silver coins you get! I’m telling ya... we gottaaaa squezeeeee ummm where it hurts and that’s buying physical silver bullion and then king calls in $SLV.  We got this!     autists unite!  EDIT: Apparently the smooth brains are out in force downvoting me because they can’t see the future through their own   shit smeared eyes and hands. So let me break it down for you like you’re 5 years old.  Kenny at the playground sold you 100 popsicle sticks at a markup of 10x for your school craft project because he stole them all from art supply closet..... no one likes Kenny. So you say hey you know what.... I’m gonna take these 100 popsicles and cut them all in half and now you have 200 popsicles and you resell them to Jennifer who really needs to get an A in class. Except Jennifer goes out and buys her own popsicles from store..... and the stores are saying they have at least 900 popsicles ready to go.... so Jennifer says I want 300.... but now the stores say hey.... we really only had 100 and Kenny just bought the last 100.... so now the popsicles are all Gone!   NO ONE HAS POPSICLES. So now Kenny can go sell them for as much as he wants because supply States so.   In summary it takes us to buy the popsicles(physical silver) first in order to reveal behind the curtain that the stores (banks) don’t actually have as many popsicles as they say they do... therefore $SLV squooozeeees and we are all happy
A Deep Value Prospect that always beats earnings.
Summary      Company represents an excellent deep value prospect for long-term investors.   The company has an excellent operating history but was slammed by the current downturn.   Leverage is not unreasonable and once the company turns around, it will offer strong upside prospects.   New fad of collecting Pops!   Shares rallied \~25% in the aftermath of reporting third-quarter results.   This is due to a broad earnings beat in Q3 alongside a general recovery in the markets for names tethered to economic recovery.   It's impact from the pandemic bottomed out in Q2, and though revenue is expected to be negative through Q4, Wall Street expects a return to growth next year.   Company trades at only \~15x next year's EPS estimates and \~8x the earnings it generated in FY19.        This company is an iconic modern-day toy company. Despite its status as a fast-growing, quality firm at the height (so far) of its popularity, the company has been slammed by fears related to retail shutdowns. Investors have panicked about deserted malls and sent shares of the firm spiraling down in recent months. Near-term pain is over and the company’s prospects improving, now might be a good time to jump in and consider buying up a piece of the enterprise on the cheap.    A great operating history    Operating history of this company has been, over time, really impressive. Take, for instance, the case of revenue. Between 2017 and 2019, sales at the firm grew   from $  million to $  million. As sales at the company grew, the company’s profits improved as well. Back in 2017, the company’s net income totaled just $  million. By 2019, net profit had grown to $  million. Before we move on to other metrics, the firm’s net profit does warrant some discussion. Despite the company’s strong brand name, it has been unable to capitalize on it in the way that can generate attractive margin. Even in 2019, its best year on record, the company’s net profit margin was   It’s a positive that this trend has been improving, but until margins grow substantially from here, the company is at risk of a bad year really hurting it.  While bottom line wasn't great during shut downs, its other operating metrics are attractive. Operating cash flow, for instance, totaled $  million. This was more than triple the $  million in operating cash flow seen two years earlier. Even compared to 2018, this metric is up   This works out to an operating cash flow margin for 2019 of   Another important metric, Adjusted EBITDA, has also done well. Back in 2017, this metric totaled $  million. This grew   to $  million by 2019. This margin works out to   for 2019.          It might be time to jump on board    There’s no doubt that it is being hit at the moment, but it’s important to keep the eye on the long-term outlook. Though management has provided no long-term guidance for the business, its operating history prior to the pandemic suggests that its future will continue to be bright once the crisis is past.  If we use metrics from 2019, its price/earnings ratio of 17 looks quite high. Its price/operating cash flow multiple, though, is far lower at   Its EV/EBITDA multiple on that basis is also low at   This makes the company a clear deep-value prospect. Even if we annualize the firm’s first quarter EBITDA, its forward EV/EBITDA multiple is still quite reasonable at  , which means that   it is cheap   now if we assumed that the future of the business would look a lot more like this year is likely to look.    Takeaway    Based on the data provided, it’s clear to me that this company presents investors with some very attractive prospects at the moment. The company has a nice operating history. Its cash flows are particularly attractive. Right now, the business is being hurt by the global pandemic just like most firms across most industries, but once this pain passes, the upside from here could be quite significant.   It is a great reopening investment and also great play on collectable fad that staying at home has ushered.    Positions: March and Feb $15 Calls; disclaimer I'm not a financial advisor.
UPDATE: GameStop short squeeze fuels new stock-market services tracking Reddit messages
I hate myself
Don't give in to FUD and wholesome posts about gains -which I have seen for the FIRST time
Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt .  These "gainz"posts are becoming more and more common from last couple of days indirectly telling people that the squeeze happened and they all made profits bla bla (few genuine people  made profits -not the rest scammy ones.!)  And yes, it "seems" there won't be a 2nd squeeze (I don't believe it though) if you search anywhere on YouTube or even reddit .   I have reasons to believe it will or else we won't have so much manipulative shit going around.   I mean same graphs for AME and GMC for 5 straight days? Increasing "gain-porn" in the week or biggest losses ? Media telling us it's over and treating it like history ?   Yeah well I am buying tomorrow . Maybe it is over maybe it's not .    Anyways if you need money or stupidly invested by taking a fucking loan or your college loan, sell it if you want to for a fraction if that helps you . We don't judge ya.   Anyways. Obligatory   GME to The MOON       28@128 open  10@55 open 45@50 closed  Buying more tomorrow. Never gonna sell at a loss so my fucking money goes directly to the guys in suits and what not . Fuck em.  Typed by a drunk Irish sitting on the porch at 2 am   Take care and enjoy your Sunday you ugly ass DIAMOND hands apes !
If GME gain porn is cool again, then I'll share mine. $  in 19 days.
Lemming: a disparaging term for an investor who exhibits herd mentality and invests without doing their own research, which often leads to losses.
Ok guys and gals, one of the greatest strengths of this community is that there are always people who are willing to check your work, give a different perspective, alert you something you may have missed, or poke holes in your DD.  Now there are millions upon millions of us, with our collective knowledge and experience this should make us one of the greatest forces on the planet right?  If we continue to berate and downvote everyone who has a dissenting opinion, we will not succeed. You will collectively run off a financial cliff, while those of us who do know what they are doing will empty the pockets of your dead bodies.  I encourage everyone to learn as much as possible, understand what the folks that post DD are saying, ask questions and contribute to this community for everyone’s success.  Not everyone is a bot, or out to get you and it is ok if they have a different point of view than you. GME has spoiled us, stocks are never this easy but they could be if we used our collective knowledge and experience.     TLDR: Don’t be a Lemming, dissenting opinions are ok, learn while you are here, I am not a bot, and I don’t work for a hedge fund.  GME 25 @$
Food for Thought
I wanted to take a time-out and lay out some of my thoughts on everything that has happened in the last few weeks. This was always about seeing the VALUE in the future of the company, and making a play on that value. Yes it was shorted an extreme amount and we saw the potential in the short squeeze as well. There were many excellent DD's written about both the company and the potential for the short squeeze along with possible scenario's for this. I personally didn't think we would see any drastic change in price until after Q4 ER, but look at where we are now.  With that being said, I want to focus on several things that have happened over the course of January, how it impacted us, and why this is still continuing today. I will start with January 12th, as this is when things started to get interesting.  Jan 12th:  GME closes around $20.  Jan 13th:  GME opens around $28  GME closes around $31  Jan 14th:  GME opens around $35  GME closes around $40  From January 14th to close of January 21st, GME trades sideways between $35-$45. Later that evening on January 21st, something crazy happened....  WSB was taken down, and a picture was put up that said DoJ, FBI, ICE, and Europool had seized this "hidden site". Like what? Its a public forum.... ok, anyways. WSB is down for an hour or two, and when it comes back up, there's a VERY interesting post from a guy that says there are much bigger players involved in this, a shitstorm is brewing, and he has proof that the mods have verified. The top comment is from a mod that said he had verified OP's sources. I barely got to read through the post once along with the mods comment before Reddit kicked me out and the app reset on my phone. Boom, post is gone, and a few people mention seeing it and wondering wtf that was all about. Now we get to January 22nd, a Friday.  January 22nd:  GME opens at $47  GME closes around $64  Most if not call options are ITM. Gamma squeeze time. Hype had started to creep in during the weekend. We open Monday like this:  January 25th:  GME opens around $117  GME closes around $76  At some point during this week, I don't remember exactly which day, the media started attacking us. Bots started to fill up our beloved subreddit, and our lines of communication were hurt while we sorted through the bullshit.  January 26th:  GME opens around $87  GME closes around $150  January 27th:  GME opens around $370  GME closes around $350  January 28th:  GME hits above $500 in premarket.  Before markets officially open, RH and other brokers decide to block all buying, and allow only selling. Fidelity and a few others did not participate in this, the majority did.  GME closes around $200  January 29th:  GME opens around $330  GME closes above $320  When GME closed above $320, most calls were ITM (cant remember if we had $800c options yet). Lots of media saying the squeeze already happened, bot attacks, media saying we are pumping SLV (wut? lol) or random biotech companies, and negative posts from bots / whoever the fuck else.  February 1st:  GME opens around $240  GME closes around $220  I don't think I need to recap the next couple of days for you, it is burned into our minds, but several important things happened. DFV was called to testify on the 19th of February in front of the House Financial Services Committee. On Wednesday our sub was compromised and tons of negative sentiment flooded in, a lot of new members posting the diamond hand spam, etc. Our sub is most likely still compromised, and we don't know when we will have it back.  So lets highlight what they have done so far:  1. Discredit DFV in the media, and call him to testify.  2. Break our lines of communication by compromising our subreddit.  3. Sow doubt and fear amongst us with the flood of bots and negative sentiment. We have suspect accounts posting gain porn from GME, downvoting or telling people to sell, and spamming the sub with other bullshit.  4. Restricting demand of stock while it is flooded with supply. This wasn't lifted until Friday, in which we saw our first green day of the week. (  FUCK ROBINHOOD IN PARTICULAR!   We don't care if you want to blame it on the DTCC, you caved in, plus, where did that 3bn in additional capital come from you managed to raise by Thursday?)  5. Paper Portnoy getting his million followers to jump in and subsequently sell for a loss. I truly wouldn't be surprised if this was a ploy by the men up top to pump and dump the stock and scare everyone into selling.  6. 4 days of red before restrictions are removed and demand catches back up to supply (price dropping increases demand also via opportunity cost). Keep in mind, a lot of people were transferring holdings over to new brokers and had money tied up until Friday, when we see our first green day.  Let me be crystal clear here, if they have to tell us we have lost, yet still attack us, then we haven't lost. There is a LOT more going on here than just retail vs hedge funds. This is not over, and the big players know it. Most of us here from the beginning are here to see it to the end, as it was always about the future value of the company. To our brothers who bought at the top and are still holding, we are coming. It may not be next week, it may not even be in the next few months (I'm still eyeing Q4 ER), but we are coming. I don't care if you think the stock is overvalued at $  I don't give a fuck if you sold for a loss. You don't realize any gains or losses until you sell. Buy the dip and average down retard. I will be holding because I can afford to hold, and I believe in the future of this company. I am not a financial professional, just a smooth brained retard. I do hold positions in GME and have been in since $14.  This is not financial advice, just sharing my thoughts.  Read some more from these beautiful autists:    Gamma Squeeze         Squeeze isn't Squoze         Hedge funds have not repositioned yet         TL;DR   At least read the links from the autists. Not like you got anything better to do while your wife and her boyfriend are off vacationing for the weekend.
GME GAINS 19k --> 161K
NOT trying to pour salt over a colossal, crowd-sourced wound of epic proportions never, ever witnessed before because of a meme that went so fucking far off the rails that it was hard to discern faction from fiction and everyone finally agreed that it's just a simulation - but eventually the bags you're holding will be worth something in 2035.  Diamond hands, comrades, diamond hands.
Wsb has changed my life. Like it here
KISS ON GME SI, Where are the Selling 13Fs? -- NO Selling 13Fs NO Major GME Short Covering

Thanks to you crazy apes
The January blues kicked my ass. Heads been a poop place for most of the last year.  This rally of the apes has brought a smile to my face on the ups and the downs.  The moon, the rockets and the diamond fucking handed apes, I love it all.  I'm a first time investor   which isn't a lot but I'm proud of my hairy diamond studded middle finger pointed straight at wall street.  I may not be on the rocket but I'll have a nice view of you all on your way up, from the comfort of my fancy new rubber dingy floating in a pond somewhere.  I'm glad to be part of something that'll be remembered.   Stay strong apes ❤️  Edit This really rustled some jimmies But my jimmies remain very unrustled    :o silver. Thankyou my friend. May your Jimmes remain stong  :o more silver.  Don't spend here yo! I'm just some ape.   thanks for all the kind words, you degenerates really know how to use your keyboard. maybe see you next weekend with a little porn for your filthy selves. gotta keep you all entertained when the market is shut right?
Fuck Robinhood and Trading 212
This is a question for my fellow europoors!  Can you recommend a platform that doesn't block trading? Revolut is fucked, Trading 212 is fucked, Degiro is not for me cause it's not in my country (yeah, i'm based in europe's shitstain part of the continent), Interactive Brokers is also a no go since if i recall correctly it was the reason T212 blocked and they also blocked trading.  Thank you my fellow autists, may your paste alway be sweet
Head and Shoulders $GME
I been seeing a lot of cocksuckers posting about how the $GME short squeeze is a head and shoulders?   Well guess what retards?   That first wave up to $450 was only a bloody kneecap.     Next time the shoulder might appear, who knows, maybe the chart will make a dysfunctional autistic ape where its head grew into his neck and it'll just be a straight shot to tendieland.     You wanna show your wife's boyfriend who's the true retard?   Sell the house.  Sell your kids, and sell a kidney or two on the blackmarket.  Fuck it, sell your smooth ape brains.  Buy some $GME and get ready to blast off.  This train will take you beyond the known universe and change your life around, one way... or another.    This is by no means any type of financial advice.
ATTENTION: The 'official' data released on Feb 9th might be completely wrong
Good morning/night/afternoon my fellow apes,  On February 9th the official short interest % will be released, with all the short sellers having to report about their short positions to FINRA.  Correct me if I'm wrong , but I'm pretty sure the short sellers CAN and WILL lie (not surprising after all they've done) and the worst thing that will happen is to them is - you guessed it - a fine that'd be dwarfed by their gains if people believed the damn number.  So don't be spooked if short interest data looks off/too low on the 9th. Posting this as a lot of people say this will be the 'make or break' info. They'll fuckin lie    TL;DR: Don't worry if the short interested reported on the 9th is low. Chances are they lied.      And as always,  🌖
Bloomberg: Five ETFs to Watch in 2021: ARKK, VTI, QQQJ, SNPE, GSLC
Out of all of them, $SNPE seems to be the least attractive safe harbor for your cash when in doubt.  $ARKK is Cathie Wood and of course she is a saint. The one with the most upside  $qqqj, I am going to try on monday and see how it goes. All of these have nice companies in it .   For all the new people, ETFs for the most part are dummy proof. Just buy shares or leaps for slow to steady gains. Yes they can go tits up and burn like $ICLN. But more than not you can make or at least not lose all your  money if the market gets too crazy.  or go cash gang.
Extreme lack of DD posts
There seem to be hardly any new DD posts. Why?  Now some people say there is something fishy going on and the mods are still compromised.  However I would want to give the benefit of the doubt. Maybe GME is still so huge that no one wants to make good DDs or alternatively there actually aren't any good DDs except for people trying to push penny stocks. In any case there have only been 3-4 DD posts over the past 48h.  For over 4mil active members, that's hardly anything.  If people have experienced DD posts been taken down for no rule violation, then please repost the text here as a quote in the comments.  @Mods: this is supposed to generate transparency if it gets traction. If good DDs are thrown out due to a spam of Pennystocks or stronger enforcement of rules, then we can easily assess this here and it gives the community a transparent view on the DD situation.  Thanks for the work you do.  Edit: I specifically filtered for the DD flair and still found next to nothing new. Ofc that might be a filtering problem on Reddit's side, however the sentiment seems to be geared to a general lack of DDs.
A look at LGND
I'm going to start with their financial stuff you can read for yourself above. The link below is the first article I read about LGND.      I read through the article and pretty much randomly picked lgnd because it sounded good. At the time it was trading around $100 so my current position is 1 $100c 8/20.  LGND has doubled in value in about 2 months since the article. I have no idea how much more it'll go up. I'm not going to pretend I even understand what they do. I'm making money on it and just want to share the ticker so you might make money too.    Latest Report Q4 earnings on FEB 3.                  EXPECTED.    REPORTED.

WSB newbies after this week (updated)
Took longer to print this than being down 80% on GME. Still holding.
AMC Stock: A Retard's Short DD
TL;DR: Low(er) risk, high reward.  On   Friday we saw the first day in a month that AMC and GME did not follow  the same exact pattern.  While GME closed higher, AMC fell 3%.  Reason: More shorts.  Fintel reports the GME and AMC stocks being shorted as follows:        Why do I think this information is accurate/convincing?  On Friday, GME opened at  , and AMC opened at    GME met the most resistance right around 60 dollars, while AMC met the most resistance right around    3% of   is .2151. In other words,   - .2151 is    10% of   is   In other words,   +   =    So within a margin of about 1%, the difference in the resistance of AMC and GME?  13%.  The difference in the amount of shares that were shorted on Friday?  13%.  For the idiots: The growth that GME saw was the same growth AMC would've seen had it not been for a higher short %.  GME closed higher, and rose even more in the aftermarket, AMC \ started\  it's rise in the aftermarket.     GME   is dangerous, people are bailing on their shorts, some are doubling   down. Even MORE people are shorting AMC, it's not nearly as expensive,   and there's more volume to play around with.  However, even if you look at these stocks objectively,        Yahoo   Finance charts GME as Bearish, and AMC as "Neutral" despite the amount   of shares being shorted. More importantly in the bottom right, the   performance outlook for AMC is positive short, mid, AND long term.    People are saying the squeeze is over for both GME and AMC, then why is   neither stock dead in the water yet?  Why do both stocks show more   resistance on days when there is an SSR in place?  People   shorting AMC want all the focus to remain on GME while they make money   on $1 differences and the spikes in AMC daily.  Everyone is waiting   until Tuesday for the short reports but who knows if and how accurate   those will be, what I do know is the math points to AMC being heavily   shorted because hedgefunds and sour retailers want to kill the business   before it has a chance to get back on it's feet post covid so they can   make "easy money".  Consensus:   Don't take my word for it, I'm just an ape with a keyboard, and   definitely NOT a financial advisor. But AMC should open higher on Monday   than it closed on Friday, and if retail gains the sort of momentum  that  GME had, there will be money to be made, it took months for GME  because  they kept fighting the re-shorting battle, AMC's $20 spike  wasn't  relatively close to GME's despite the fact that at one point,  AMC's  shares were worth more than GME's (pre-hype).  If the momentum  dies,  then so does the stock, and that's what the people shorting this  stock  are betting on, that's why when GME maintained a high(er) price  for  months, it eventually squeezed, because the interest + risk of  having to  pay even MORE money for the shorted stocks caught up to the  people  shorting it when they realized retailers weren't going to fuck  off.  Good outlook, low risk, potential reward while simultaneously fucking shorters?  $AMC.
Trading for 4 months now, this sub has changed my life. Thank you RC 😘
You Are Here
🙏 ape gang!!
No seriously it’s time to get over it. Everyone who’s been here longer than two weeks is tired of the posts about who’s still holding, trying to predict the daily movements and for the love of god the absolute NONSENSE conspiracies.  Stop living in denial for two fucking seconds and listen. The ONLY reason GME got as high as it did was because of the media. It was portrayed as a “David vs Goliath” story which started a buying frenzy that everyone wanted to be a part of. I know you dipshits don’t understand how the stock market works but I’m sure you can understand simple supply and demand.   Look at the chart. You can literally see the day it became national news, and like most things, it was viral for a few days followed by NO ONE GIVING A SHIT EVER AGAIN.  So that’s it. Here we are with GME back to reasonable volume, backpedaling it’s way to a more reasonable value. If you have shares you have two choices, hold because you think the return from this point will be stronger than other investments, or sell because you think it won’t. What you paid for the shares has absolutely nothing to do with it. “Diamond hands” isn’t a admirable ballsy move it’s idiot speak for “I’m too scared and dumb to determine if I was wrong and need to move on”.  If you do hold, you need to realize it will be a while. You need to stop constantly checking the price, stop telling yourself you will wake up tomorrow and see it at +100%, stop coming on here looking to confirm your beliefs. Find something else to do to occupy your time before you lose your mind.  This is not the first time this sub has bum rushed a stock after its hit multiple ATHs only for it to come crashing back down, and it won’t be the last. It’s over.
My fellow autists... Palantir ($PLTR) has arrived.
February 19th   is when the lockup expires for Palantir.  Are you ready to buy the dip on the next company we get to tell our grandkids about?  February 16th is their earnings report. Which they most likely are going to blow out of the park. Granted this goes well; we look at February 19th when the lockup expires. Do insiders sell at all time highs? Most likely to unload some of it and pay themselves. This is a BTFD opportunity on a company that has potential. They're rare and only visit us once in a while.      Edit: This is by no means financial advice.
Abcellera- 02/12 Earnings and Potential Against Competitors
Hey everyone,  This will most likely get deleted due to my account not having enough to karma. I just wanted to start a discussion regarding Abcellera. In my opinion the Peter Thiel backed company is extremely interesting and has a potential for large-ish revenue in the future due to royalties.   However, at the moment the company has extreme disparity between market cap and revenue that makes me somewhat uncomfortable. Especially in comparison to its competitors like CERT.  What is everyone’s thoughts on this?  Thanks!
Listen, Disney is going to the moon! Read why my fellow WSB YOLOers!
Made the biggest due diligence today - Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)  Firstly, Disney is a strong competitor to Netflix with their streaming service, Disney+. Since its release they have pumped subscription numbers that only Netflix could dream about. Disney is not only trying to increase their revenues through blockbuster movies, but also by dragging new viewers to flagship series such as 'The Mandalorian' and more recently, 'WandaVision'. On top of this they are planning to produce more Marvel series (they own Marvel Studios daah...). These series will most likely be starring big boi action figures such as Electro, Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, Doctor Strange and Thor. I don't know shit about these characters since I could care less about The Avengers (all I care about is stonks).  Secondly, Disney will rocket to Pluto when the Pandemic is over and they open up their amusement parks. All kids and/or your wives kids (from another boyfriend/husband) will beg their parents to ride Mickey Mouse's Roller Coaster and Disney is going to pump the revenues like they never have before. Do you remember when when you were a kid and always begged your parents for stuff? Well that is going to happen with both Disney+ and their amusement parks. Kids will cry till their parents take them there.  Thirdly, invest on your own risk. This is only food for thought! I will give you some more spicy investment advise should I be successful. No Profit & Loss, Balance sheet and Cash Flow stuff here, just pure future prospects,   YOLO.  Disney earnings 11 February. Good luck!

Is Melvin still shorting GME?
Hey guys just want you all to check my smooth brain math and tell me what you think.  My understanding is that Melvin Capital held a short position of approximately 40% of GME shares, or approximately 38M shares.  E: 38M is a worse than worst case number 40% would be approx 28M. Also I don't even know where 40% comes from I've just seen it around reddit a bunch. It's probably much higher than reality.  Melvin reported losses of approximately $6B in January well before the share hit $300 and claimed to be out of their position on the ~~22nd~~ 26th when the shares were worth approximately ~~$50~~ $150. But for the worse than worst possible case scenario let's use $300 share price and see if the numbers add up.   ,Corp%20at%20%2425%20per%20share.  >The formula for the interest calculation will be: (Market Value x Rate x # of days) / 360.  I have seen the rates for GME reported at an insanely high 10%, let's assume worse than worst case scenario and and call that 15%.  Let's also not worry about complicated integrals and assume the price was $300 every day of january.  So, ($300   .15   30) / 360   38,000,000 = $142,500,000  Last time I checked $  is a whole lot less than 6B using every possible worse than worst case scenario. Seems like their losses were probably incurred exiting their short position.  I'm pretty uninformed, what am I missing?
$gme      lick my
I'm enjoying the memes, I yolo'd 50k and wound up with 450 shares at about   pps.  You know, there are fagts who simply play calls and puts all day... So ask who's playing, are they selling the   Are they playing the calls?  To the actual shareholders, we have control because we own the stock and it is about our patience, but other actors(   and put players) are attacking holders psychologically.  If Cuban, Elon, Chamath, Ryan, and Burry are the biggest owners  collectively, OR EVEN big hedges, they can force options "in the money,"   This will force shorts to cover big time. Short interest players will get fukt, while the professionals hold and squeeze the price per share up to a point where shorting can't even work. The sharks are here, so tread with some smooth brain.  For me, I'm just a retarded ape looking for easy money through volatility. I can't thank the #gmegang enough for their carbon hands. As for me. 50k hit or miss.     Are forever until the squeeze is squoze.  Welcome to r/wallstreetbets, where everyone has a personal agenda.

STOP HOPPING ON CLEAR P MP AND D MPS YOU DEGENERATE FUCKS
(censored pump and dump in title because of sub rules)   Everyday I've profiting nicely off my call positions with MSOS and APHA until you fucks came and pumped SNDL causing weed stock to plummet.   All it takes is one second of DD to see that SNDL shares are overproduced, diluted as fuck, and the company behind them is literal dogshit. They sent out weed that had mold and bits of rubber gloves and were sued because of it (look it up).   For the love of your wallet please stop hopping into the first ticker you read on here without doing some research.
What exactly is this EV "chip shortage" and what American firms can supply them?
GM, Ford, solar companies, everyone is complaining about a chip shortage. What are these chips they keep talking about? Are they just talking about semiconductors in general? I think I might of read they are needed in the inverters to convert DC battery power to AC power needed for the motor. Would this just be silicon/germanium transistors?  I know there's also been a shortage of semiconductors used to make high end video cards, although im not sure if this is the same thing affecting the EV industry.    Also heard the govt is going to be looking into giving incentives to american companies that can manufacture these components. Anyone aware of US firms that could potentially do this?

WILL YOU EVER LEARN??? WE DON’T CONTROL THE MARKET
I am absolutely and completely retarded when it comes to the market, as smooth as they come. I see stock go   buy, I then see stock go down and I hold. (I have gotten better at this, hold your applause) I know nothing about market cap, maybe higher market cap more tendies???? Yeah see I’m stupid   Now that you know I’m retarded let’s look at what’s happened the past month. The entire country got together and was on the GME train.  Could we control the market? Nope, not even fucking close. Did we learn our lesson? No, we are stupid as shit.  This my theory of weed stock. Someone please hop in and tell me to fuck off if I’m wrong but in my opinion they sucked us in. On Wednesday’s pre market weed stonks were    , market opened, everyone bought at   rocket ship crashed. Around noon time everything seemed to recover and all is good.   Okay so today, (Thursday) pre market was up everything was looking great! However we all learned are lesson!! Market will open, things will dip and THEN we buy because Stonks only go up!! Only today we got played and rocket ship kept plummeting. Maybe it was intentional and maybe it wasn’t but if I was on their shoes I’d be looking for ways to control us retards as well.  If you still think we pull the strings and you think you’re going to sit on your shitty little iPhone, make a couple Reddit posts with rocket ships and outplay people who do this for a living go get therapy or pound your head against your shitty Honda Civic.   They prey on us, they don’t give a fuck. If you’re up 200% on something why the fuck would you hold. If someone gave you $200 are you going to sit there and wait for more??? Probably because you’re a brainless ape.  Also if someone wants to explain this day trade limit thing to me and why it’s in place pls let me know. Shouldn’t it be the opposite so the smaller fish can protect themselves than these big hedge funds being able to control the market with a few clicky clickies.   Ty and God Bless
Let's not hype things up and stay humble
Dear redditors,  This post might get removed and downvoted, but I wanted to say this.  Can we please not hype the stocks so much up or was it always like this? Cant remember that...  In my opinion we should just post our positions and DDs. As hyping things much may lead people to lose money or even life when they buy on the top.  I miss old WSB where everyone was just chilling out with their gain and loss porn.  Now I feel like this is a commutity is full of people trying to get rich fast without any research etc.

$SONO DD
Alright autists, going to give you a real simple DD that everyone can understand.  Remember when $PTON was trading in the $20s? Let me remind you... There was this flashy exercise bike company that thought they would take the home gym market by storm. It was slow, but then the pandemic hit. There was a huge shift to home gyms and $PTON crushed earnings in May 2020. Their stock rocketed to $43 and the rest is history.  I am happy to say that the $PTON rocket to $43 in May 2020 is where we are today with $SONO.  $SONO just reported earnings ($  EPS) that beat estimates ($.88 EPS). Along with that, they raised their 2021 revenue ($  and earnings targets -     But back to why this makes sense from a trend perspective. First off, $SONO has industry leading sound quality for home audio. I own it. It is amazing. The reason I bought it was, after a long search, they were the only true wireless surround sound (and full home audio) company out there. Their tech is very far ahead of their competitors and it shows with constant growth in revenue.  But, the main trend... Warner Bros is releasing blockbusters to HBO Max the same day as theaters, Netflix subscriptions are up, Disney is releasing movies same day to Disney+, streaming services are popping up left and right... AMC and other theaters are HURTING and might not hold on. There is a massive shift to in-home theaters and $SONO dominates when it comes to in-home audio.  In the future, they will partner with some fancy new EV company for in-car audio. They have plans to do that.  Anyway, I see $SONO going to $70 by EOY.  Positions -  6 3/19 $40c  33 7/16 $45c  3 shares @ $   TLDR - Buy $SONO. Trend to in-home theater and audio is just beginning to be noticed. Lagged the in-home gym trend, but is a bigger market. $SONO is the industry-leader in performance and only true full-home wireless audio company out there. In-car audio coming soon. $70 EOY PT. Writing on a computer so please spam rockets to make up for the lack of them up here.
I'm Shorting r/Wallstreetbets (Wallstreetbets is exactly BACKWARDS)
New strategy   Because all you new apes are stinking up the whole zoo with your paper handed shit, Yall have effectively reversed the market (and let in the lions).      1. Any thread created to discuss a new stock immediately tanks that stock. 2. Yall are market destroyers so in order to make those tendies I will now be shorting r/wallstreetbets       Essentially betting against every popular stock thread and trend that emerges from here.   (GME,AMC,SNDL,TLRY,APHA,ZOM,CLF,BP,etc.)      You say buy, I sell. You say long, I short.      we'll see how it goes. Yall some actual retards.
If you have a stock that’s doing well long term- don’t post it here. Clearly, you will lose money if you do.
So I have been running with few stocks that have done very good in the long run. Not amazing but a respectable 20-30% bull run a week.   I have some research and DD done for them but a bit hesitant to even say the ticker name because of the absolute state of the sub.   I think what happened was a mix of different kinds of people after the GME conflict. Many new users have never seen gain bigger than .04% in their chase savings account, so for them, a gain of 10-20% is absolutely massive and will get out as soon as they realize that gain because “10% is a once in a life time” for them.   Of course this leads to the conflict with the old retards that want to see 10,000% in the call options. And the new will alway win because it’s about 4m to 2m in number here in this sub.   This is not investments. This is a get rich quick scheme. I think this is what’s not being understood by the newer people and what the older people don’t understand about new people. New people treat this sub as investment, gaining 10-20% a day is absolutely amazing. So they take profit and buy dip. Etc. nothing wrong with that.   I also would like to venture that there are definitely hedgfunds (not large but small ones) that have started to ride our the momentum for short term for stocks in this sub. The massive volume in premarket is the first realization of this (I know most of you old retards don’t use anything like actual trading platform beside robinhood so you’re stuck with market days only and I’m guessing 99% of the new retards don’t even know you CAN trade AF and pre market).
Hey SNDL gang. You are more than welcome to come back

To make this place a true casino, we need to make a betting site whether the squeeze will happen or not
Bet on whether squeeze will happen or not for something maybe like on augur. Half of the retards can bet on either side while other half hold their guns and get ready to join in.  Instead of putting words online, we can put money and go full retard gambling nuns.  Either way we can see if people are willing to downble down on retards  Not offering any financial advice. Just want a casino built, so I can bet whether squeeze will happen.

Can someone who was here before all the hype tell me why AMC got a lot of attention in tandem with GME?
GME had a absolutely bonkers short interest, Ryan Cohen on the board, decent earnings, little to no debt, FTDs out the ass. it was the perfect set up for a short squeeze.  And you know what got a large percentage of the attention for seemingly no reason? No DD? No large discussions about it? AMC.   If you’re wondering why I’m writing this post, why do I care?   it’s because I’m genuinely confused as to why — when I told my friend to buy GME at 30 dollars and showed him hundreds of posts from here, I demonstrated that  the squeeze was inbound, I taught him all the concepts that went into the MOASS theory, the     mission was about to commence— he went ahead and waited until GME was at 150, bought a single share, and then bought 200 shares of AMC at its peak and is now holding the bag as he rightfully should.   AMC had no fundamental reason for a squeeze, it has like a 50% SI as a percentage of float which is still high... but it wasn’t even close to a perfect set up that GME had.    AMC was actually a dying company unlike (GME which is also dying) but it was like the difference between dying in a cardboard box and dying while cozy warm and strung out in a hospital bed surrounded by your family.  And lastly, AMC HAD NO DD.
$FB DD Valuation - Actual investing thread
I'm going to aim for a quick write up so forgive my lack of fluidity. As always with investing, I invite counterpoints and criticisms/holes etc. of my pov.  Start with valuation - What should be the forward multiple for a stock like this. Practically every social media names trade at ~50+ forward multiple, each of course with diff verticals/growth rates/opportunities obv.  Mega cap names are trading at ~30 or so. Google is about there, msft and aapl are a tad higher and amzn trades in its own level largely due to bezos and what he's created etc.  The market trades at 22x.  Facebook trades at ~21x.  Of this forward multiple (its expected earnings), one can presume there isn't much contribution from whatsapp due to the egregiously low multiple of 21. (no one is expecting whatsapp to suddenly monetize to the extent it produces ~2,4,10 billion in revenue in the next ~handful of years.) Analyst expect   eps in the next year, this gives the ~21x.  Lets break fb into parts - fb/insta/whatsapp (lets just assume oculus/vr doesn't surmount to anything).  whatsapp purchased for   1. We know more about insta's contribution and with its greater growth and higher monetization (2/3rds of new add growth) we could probably assume it with at least a 30-40 multiple,   market cap (snap is 100 and insta has 4x more users etc. I think 200 is conservative and fair, Id say more but w/  Whatsapp has now over 2 bil users, likely   This also would trade at 30-40x at what? 100 billion? Again, I'd say more, much more actually but let's just go with that right now.  This is important now -- fb is 750. They hold 70~ in net cash so the biz collectively is worth 680.  Insta is 200, whatsapp is   would be left with the remaining (BUT let's not forget there are efficiencies gained so let's say that in totality is worth 30 or w/e). We're left with FB, just facebook worth 350b. Now its a waste of time to discuss fb's reach and its continued growth etc etc because we should all know that already.  HERES THE BIG POINT - Assuming insta is worth 200, whatsapp 100, and as said above, their multiple is 30-40 (which I guarantee you would be the case considering every social media company and most tech names with growth similar to these     facebook would be left at a 350b valuation with a what...~10-15 forward multiple.  Now, who the fk would think a company the reach of  , the #4 downloaded app ahead of snap regularly, with growing users every year and stable users in n/a & eu   growing arpu   trade at 12 forward earnings.  Mark my words, fb will do what apple did, it will do what mu has recently done, it will be re-rated and the st will shortly forget the arguments of why fb traded at 20x while the market and all its peers are trading 50% higher. Break fb up (it wont happen), by all   stocks alone or together, are worth way more than 750.  Now as for apple and whatsapp very quickly and maybe I'll comment about it more in detal if people converse about it.  Apple - Unity just reported (with 50% ads, much less targeting ability than fb) apple should impact 6% or so of their revenue. Snap's guidance and commentary didn't seemed concerned. Facebook, as analysts and others have suggested, are likely going to lose 1-5% revenue. This equates just 3-4 months of pause in the stock, if not less, it's not this glorified terror that is going to ruin fb. It's nothing. no one will actually care after it passes lol.  2nd about whatsapp. whatsapp has like 60% or so of india's smartphone uses and in a few months, are going to announce their 'super app' integration with that big retailer I forgot the name, look it up if you care. They are trying to replicate wechat and become an app where people message each other, call each other, purchase food, purchase clothes, buy airplane tickets, show snap stories, etc. And they will also have facebooks data of those .5 bil users as well to help with suggestions/ads etc. TLDR - whatsapp is going to contribute 200-300 billion in market cap to fb in the next 3-4 years thru actual monetization.  The ONLY case you can make for fb trading this low is that you think it will be replaced 10-15 years from now or w/  which case, it shouldn't reflect this much in the stock as of right now. ONCE they show notably, real declines in users, stagnation in revenue,   can panic and trade it closer to the market, but that is NOT the case right now. What will happen is - facebook will begin to trade closer to its peers and even more when they see continued growth in their top line - which will come from whatsapp's domination of india and maybe even brazil? Also, in 10-20 years, those weaker countries will start growing more in arpu, which would be HUGE for growing fb's top line. Something I've learned is - snap/tiktok, twitter, reddit, discord, netflix, youtube, insta, fb, can ALL live among each other. Each offers its own utility to each user. The harder would be for tiktok/snap to break into fb's territory rather than the other way around. Fb/insta 'profiles' will be here 20 years from now.  TLDR: I think fb is going to ~double in 3 years and triple in ~5. It should be at least 30% higher than its current price.
If you lost big, we've all been there. I've won and lost big many times; there's always a way back. (Trades in comments)
FUBO massive growth prospects, the importance of addressable market size (TAM) and revenue per customer (CLV)
FUBO TV is a sports focused “cable on the internet” streaming service, replacing your cable package (avg. $100+ per month) for $65 per month. In January they acquired Vigtory, a sports betting startup, and will integrate it into their streaming platform this year. Entering 2021 FUBO has \~500,000 subscribers, with 80% year over year growth, and a market value of \~$5 billion.  These numbers mean two things: First,   FUBO has a proven product   with traction and growth. Second, it has   just started to penetrate a massive market  . While there are many excellent companies in the streaming and sports betting space, most are already past this growth phase. ROKU has a market cap of $55 billion. DKNG has a market cap of $25 billion. PENN has a market cap of $20 billion. This is why all the analysts are excited about FUBO.   It is much easier for FUBO to go from $5 billion to $50 billion over the next few years, than a competitor to go from $25-$50 billion to $500 billion which is Facebook/Tesla level.    There are still 80 million Americans who have yet to cut the cord, who can probably save money today by switching to FUBO. There are 30 million Americans who have cut the cord, and can add live sports with FUBO while the bars are closed. All of them can spend a lot more money on FUBO once betting is up, since the Supreme Court struck down the federal sports betting law in 2018 in Murphy vs. NCAA.  Combining a $100 billion a year streaming/cable market, with a $20 billion a year and growing sports betting market, means enormous growth prospects for little FUBO at $400 million a year revenue and 80% year over year growth.  At $50 a share, FUBO’s valuation is about $10,000 per subscriber. This is about 10x the Netflix valuation of $1000 per subscriber. This might seem high, but it is in fact a fair valuation for several reasons. First, it is a $65 per month product. Second, it has increased its advertising revenue 153% last year to a small but significant $  million. Third, sports betting could make a large percent of FUBO subscribers 100x more valuable than the typical streaming customer. Fourth, Netflix has 200 million subscribers vs FUBO’s 500 thousand, meaning more value can be imputed to growth. Most importantly, all these reasons are still applicable even if FUBO grows another 50-100% for the next few years. FUBO’s customer lifetime value (CLV) is probably already above the norm, and can moon with more advertising and gambling. That is why many are confident that FUBO can be the next ROKU, and reach $200/share or more in the next few years.  In fact,   at $50 per share FUBO’s price/sales is \~45, compared with 56 for DKNG and 35 for ROKU, despite having better growth prospects.   This means FUBO can probably sustain a higher price today, even before news over the next year validates the growth thesis. And there might be short squeeze! (See other DD for that).  I am long FUBO with both shares and calls. I am not a financial advisor.       Addendum 2/9:    I have been doing more research, specifically into the bear thesis that FUBO will get killed by incumbents via competition and bad content deals. Well it turns out that short seller fud is bs. FUBO is strongly supported by major industry players, and I am sure the margins/deals will improve with growth. Here are some random tidbits to calm the nerves.     1. Goldman Sachs 13G just came out showing they bought   million shares     of the common  h/t John Textor (more on him later)        2. Viacom, Disney, and Comcast each control about 5% of the voting power via preferred shares  see FUBO S1:       3. Edgar Bronfman Jr. is the Chairman of the Board  He is a billionaire that has been Chairman and/or CEO of Warner Music Group, Vivendi Universal, and Seagrams (he is the heir). Presumably he can twist arms if the legacies do anything too unfair.     4. Reverse merger with Facebank Group in 2020  Facebank Group was founded by John Textor and makes those holograms at music festivals. Tupac at Coachella was Textor's work. What does this weirdness mean? 1) They are probably smart enough to pull off the sports betting tech. 2) They have weird aces up their sleeve. 3) I'm buying more FUBO

Evidence points to GME Shorts not having covered but pretending they did (via the use of options to illegally "cover" with synthetic long shares) to break the squeeze
Long post ahead, but I encourage you to read the whole thing.  (This is a re-post and an updated version of a GME DD that reached the front page of WSB and many requested it to be pinned. I am re-posting for visibility and because I believe the message should be shared, particularly at this junction in time. If you've seen this post before, I would appreciate an upvote for visibility)   TLDR:   Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to "cover" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options  . Full details below.  There’s an insightful piece on   that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.  The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.  \ \   From TradeSmithDaily:  Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.  \ \   The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”  \ \   From TradeSmithDaily:  The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.  The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.  The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can  .  The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:    If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.   A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.   The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.   This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.   As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.   The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.  It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that   hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes   that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.  Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:     “Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.     ”    \ \   In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares (  about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.  These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.  If this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment,   if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss   when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes "its only a loss when you sell." The version for shorts would be "its only a loss if you close out your short positions."  Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts    In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.  I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ( . In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.  In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.    A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions        B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at      Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the "new" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.  If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.  There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay "retarded" longer than funds can stay solvent. The "paper hand" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)  At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:      "Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them."   I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.     "If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles."   Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read   and other potential methods.     "If his forces are united, separate them"   aka divide and conquer. Upon driving "weak-hands" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some "paper hands", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.  I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

EXPECTATIONS FOR NEXT WEEK
Well, now that RH dirty games are behind us, need to gather ourselves and think about the future. Now we know how they do it and why they do it.  Citadel injects money in Melvin while tgey influence RH to restrict trading, and trying to cover it up ? I call that sugar coated BS.  GME still heavily shorted and the price movement on Friday suggest thats its trading between 20 and 50 day MA but a breakout is imminent.  Blackbery BB is showimg everyone that a reversal of the trend is happening, maybe test $20 soon  NOK and AMC are 2 stocks not worried about, but will take a little longer to go up again.

UFO is an etf that provides diversification in the companies interested in exploring space.     Looks pretty damn good huh? The popular Virgin Galactic (spce) comes in currently as its 2nd highest holding @    Cathie from ARK investments is   Cathie has grown an enormous cult following and you can bet there will be plenty of interest. Currently UFO is the only space exploration etf in the market, and has only been around a year. Options just became available last week due to the rising volume.   Since the announcement we’ve seen spce make a huge run. Spce was an obvious choice but there are many other companies set to be bought up. Cathie likes to have ~50 companies in her etfs. Speculation which companies she decides to add can be tough, so this is why I’m playing UFO. There’s likely to be several gems that can easily 2x or 3x in the coming months if not more. Once we have more details and announcements on ARKX, hype will go way up from where it is now.   Here’s a few other reasons why UFO is both a value and momentum play:  Satellite, tourism, and telecom are now economically viable thanks to the decreasing launch costs achieved by spaceX.   Location based ride sharing and food delivery are rapidly growing because of the power of satellite-enabled navigation.   The formation of the   Space Force.  The option volume is currently low therefore UFO has wide bid ask spreads but I expect this to change in the upcoming months.   Calls and shares. 🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸

Best way to transfer out of RH
FYI: My transfer to Fidelity took 2 days, yours may vary. I opened my account last Saturday around 6 AM, initiated the transfer and was given a deadline of 2/8. Well it was fully transferred by 2/3 at 5 AM.   Steps:  1. Buy 1 cheap stock  2. Transfer everything else but the cheap one from step 1. (This is in case they transfer it wrong   mentioned   If that happens, your account will still remain active because of this cheap stock.   3. Always keep that cheap stock until you decide when you want to deactivate.  4. You can keep that account open for ease of tax documents in 2021, then deactivate.

They will want to show growth (as a public company you have to disclose numbers), hard to show growth when customers are leaving.    Couple important things:  Check your statements in RH. More than likely you will see that any position you have created is listed under Margin. Call up the other broker, inform them of the situation, make sure it is all under cash account. Do not have margin on in new account and be 100% positive that your shares will not be loaned out.   Other brokers will take time to approve you for options trading...surprise surprise, real brokers doing real things.   Each transfer from RH will cost $  you are on the phone with the new broker, ask them and they may cover the   all, they are gaining a customer so $75 isn’t going to hurt them.  ##Make sure live quotes are enabled.

You are at your favorite Starbucks having a delicious and expensive latte when a short bus full of infinite clowns pulls up.
These tourists are pissing in your favorite bathroom constantly, asking a ton of stupid questions about some local event, leaving their trash everywhere, and generally acting like complete and total rubes.  Months go by.  You've started adding a little whiskey to your lattes in the morning to get over the hangover from the night before. somehow the attention of the clowns has caused the Starbucks to expand and now there's a side section with a Mall of America and the last fully stocked Barnes & Noble.  "Fuck you all, get out of my town!" you scream in a drunken rage one morning, but the cop on the corner just shakes his head at you. "Go home. You're drunk."  "Fuck off Greg." you mutter, and glance at your bank account. The big number just doesn't give you as much satisfaction anymore.

AMD DD: A Former Meme Ready To Reignite The Rocket Fuel
A DD I found previously on WSB from u/drrona but aligns with my TA findings as well. Thought I’d share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks.  # Fundamentals:  Their latest ER:    Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%      Full year sales of $  billion    Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible.  Massive increase in guidance. They’re   expecting 37% growth   this year.  So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.  Obviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”  Imagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.  Our queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.    Some loser (  u/aatop  ) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:    Intel gained back   of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!    In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.   Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.    AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto  r. What does that tell you? That   boomers are actually converting to AMD   for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.  # Technicals:  For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.  We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.  In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here   AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.          ;format=png      ;auto=webp      ;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47  For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.    Positions: 4/16/2021 100c,            This is not financial advice. I am not a professional.   I just really like the stock.           My positions are   19 Feb 21 90c   as I expect a leg up next week or the following into the 95$ territory range (expected profit - 150% if it hits 95)   Buy stonks for a great long term hold as I expect this to probably moon to 130-140 range by EOY to early next year specifically near Q3-Q4 earnings.

Advice for transferring from RH -> Fidelity
So it seems like a lot of people are having issues with transferring away from Robinhood, I was able to successfully get all my assets away with relatively little difficulty, so I'll share my process in hopes of helping others transfer with relative ease.  # Things to expect:  1.   YOUR ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT WILL BE DEACTIVATED DURING THE TRANSFER. NO BUYING, SELLING, OR WITHDRAWING MONEY. YOU WILL STILL SEE YOUR ASSETS IN RH UNTIL THE TRANSFER COMPLETES.   2. ASSETS TRANSFERRED FROM ROBINHOOD SHOW UP AS MARGIN ASSETS. Once your assets finish transferring from RH,   call up Fidelity and ask them to convert the margin assets to cash assets.   Why does this happen? Robinhood makes every account a "limited margin" account by default since "Instant deposits" count as margin, because you are technically loaning RH's money to buy shares while your bank deposit clears. It doesn't matter if the cash is settled or not, it's the account type. RH wants to be able to use the shares you buy as collateral if a deposit doesn't go through. 3. NOT ALL ASSETS WILL TRANSFER AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR TRANSFER MAY SEEM COMPLETE BUT IF EVERYTHING IS NOT THERE IT IS NOT FINISHED. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST $75 IN YOUR FIDELITY ACCOUNT BEFORE THE TRANSFER COMPLETES. I got a little annoyed on this, Robinhood debits the brokerage account you transfer to for the $75 transfer fee, not debiting it from any settled cash you have with Robinhood first. This resulted in my Fidelity account getting charged the $75 transfer fee (and me getting margin called technically), and the \~$200 of settled cash with RH was stuck for a couple of days before finally getting transferred over. My transfer showed as complete on 2/3 (with assets and $75 fee) but the settled cash didn't transfer until 2/5.  # How to make it easier/less of a headache:  1. Make sure every transaction has settled/will settle before your ACATS request is acknowledged by RH. In personal experience, they acknowledge it within 2 business days, but assume it will happen immediately to be safe. 2. Sell any fractional shares. These don't get transferred and will be sold off anyways as part of the transfer. Idk if c\ \ \ \ \  gets sold or held since they are a different account technically, but regardless I'd not use RH for c\ \ \ \ \  anymore. (Can't fuckin say the word cuz automod) 3. Make sure NO MARGIN BALANCE (Instant Deposits or RH Gold) is being used. If they are, that will likely complicate things. This ties into #1 of making sure assets have settled, this includes deposits. If you are using any of your Instant deposit balance wait for the cash to settle first, otherwise you might get hit with some ridiculous margin debit when assets transfer. If you have a position that is using margin, probably best to talk to Fidelity before transferring to make sure you know what else is needed.  # Finally: DON'T "TRANSFER" BY SELLING ALL ASSETS ON RH AND BUYING BACK ON FIDELITY. YOU WILL PAY TAXES FOR THIS.  Good luck and FUCK ROBINHOOD.  EDIT:  /u/racerxff
Bumble (BMBL) shares to go live 11th Feb - could be worth a punt
Hey all,  I'm thinking of punting on Bumble (which will trade with the ticker BMBL) when the shares go live on 11th Feb. I'm writing this DD live as I'm fact finding, but here's my take on it.    Personal experience:    I've never needed to use a dating app personally, but I have numerous friends who absolutely live by Bumble and I've seen that it works long term (plenty of fun dates, followed by matching up and eventually marriage). My female friends who have used it love the fact that it is woman led and initiated, meaning they don't get inundated with belligerent sex pests like on other platforms, and the guys I know who use it like it because it means that there is less pressure to ooze sex appeal (that they arguably don't have) and be more honest in their profiles. It seems like a far cry from the clear market contender Tinder. As a product, if I were ever in the "available" in  that  market again, I'd probably consider using Bumble myself.    Previous valuations:      Between 2016-2018 they were approached with multiple offerings of $500M - $1B \[1\]. Their revenue in this period ranged from $10m in 2016 to $190m. This means they were effectively trading at premium multipliers of between 50 (early on) and 5 (in 2018).   In 2019 they were bought by Blackstone by $3B \[1\]. Their earnings for this year were $240m, meaning they effectively traded at a revenue premium multiplier of 12.   We don't have 2020 numbers, but in 2018 there were 35 million users and this year there are 100 million users. I would imagine that their earnings have taken a hit this year with COVID (  lockdowns preventing hookups) but this just means it might be a great opportunity to buy in now.    Some other considerations:      It has been reported that dating app usage actually went up during lockdowns \[2\] which does seem to defy logic. So potentially this might mean a nice surprise at the first public earnings announcement.   5 million use it in the US \[3\] - which is some way behind Tinder despite having a very similar market offering. This means that there is growth potential in the user base in the US, and presumably elsewhere in the world too.   As a long term hold, this has potential: most of the users of the app are aged less than 35 and this is a replenishing stock of potential customers from below.  It looks like trading will start at around $30 a share and a market capitalisation of between $6-8B. To put this in perspective, Match (who own Tinder) are currently valued at $41B - and they made $  in revenue in 2020. This means Match current trades on a revenue multiplier of 17.  Assuming that Bumble can scale 2018 earnings with users, 2020 might see revenues of around $600M. If this is the case and they can attract a similar multiplier, this puts the potential market capitalisation at something like $  This means that the price could, in relatively short term after first reported earning period, increase to between $38-50. Of course beyond this there is still plenty of scope for increasing the size of their user base, and with it additional revenue in the future.  None of this is advice, and because this hasn't been previously listed it isn't so clear to see the long term valuation of the company and could easily be wrong and it tanks immediately. But I will be buying when the bell goes on the 11th because I think it is worth a punt.     References  \[1\]    \[2\]    \[3\]

If you ever sell buy something tangible with the money.
If you ever get your tendies don't leave all of the money in the account and double down on another YOLO. The numbers in the account sometimes does not feel like real money. Take a little bit off the table. Say like 10-20% of the profits transfer it to your checking and use it to buy something that you want or need. It could be $10,000 $1,000 or $100 and you could go on a awesome vacation for $10,000 or fancy bike for $1,000 or a nice dinner for $100. It helps keeps you grounded that the numbers in a brokerage account is real money. Also the obligatory put some money aside for taxes if you take any money out of your account.
How reports in the media claiming that Reddit WallStreetBets was pushing a Silver Squeeze started. Timeline with links. (BTW: It was Reuters on January 28th at 12:03pm)
#In response to u/RizzutosNOTAWORD  , I though I would give it a try. Turns out there are over 1000 articles on it. But in doing that research I found a fairly accurate history of how this all started. And, just to be clear, a post on WSB did set the price of Silver skyrocketing; but, also to be clear, some reporters are just lazy.  #  Background    - Monday, January 25, 2021, $GME stock reached a high price of $159 per share before dropping to $76. Even though the CNBC people were calling this “A Side Show,” they spent most of the day talking about it.  -Tuesday, January 26th, 2021, $GME closes at $147 per share. WSB goes Viral on news that Melvin Capital needed a   Billion dollar bail out.    -Wednesday, January 27th, 2021, WSB was national and international front-page news. $GME hits $350 per share.    #January 27th, 2021: #How the Reddit / $SLV Rumor began ##(I’m just assuming WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day)\  1. On Thursday, January 27, 2021, u/jjalaj30 (who is not a bot) posted:    Good for Him being passionate about his investments, BTW! This post must have been seen by millions because, I’m just assuming, WSB was getting 25 million hits by this day given the virality of the previous days.  Sales of Silver ETFs and Spot began to rise   $GME reaches $480 (OP buys   shares of $GME at $360 because Why Not. Also bought $BBBY at $36… and holding).  Robinhood shuts down trading, $GME price starts immediately crashing     Thursday afternoon, at 12:03pm (I’m assuming eastern time?) the First article about Reddit causing the price Silver to go up is written by Reuters.    and quotes directly from u/jjalaj30’s post  3. On Thursday afternoon, 2:45pm, metal industry websites and investor blogs begin running blog articles stating ”Reddit Day Traders” are fueling this random rise in Silver sales: -   -   4. The first article claiming WSB was leaving $GME and heading to silver came from the Wall Street Journal at 4:38pm:      5. Blogger/reporter Anna Golubova posted an article at 11:48pm on Kitco about an Army of Day Traders piling into silver? She explains that analysts think the price of silver will reach $40 and     6. However, The London based Investors Chronicles gave a good analysis of why Silver (and Gold) were higher.     ##Friday, January 29, 2021   , 2am, Bloomberg runs a story:      Morning, Kitco News does a long segement discussing the Wednesday Reddit post about shorting Silver:  $    9. But a metal indusrty blog Mining [dot] Com does an entry on Friday morning cslling this a    “Frenzy.”   :  \  Weekend sales of physical Silver soar. From Friday to Monday the price of Silver goes from $  to $  That’s a huge jump in the silver market. Somehow, the only explanation for this has to be Reddit, right.\  10. Sunday, January 31, 2021. Bllomberg TV does a story:     ##By Monday, Feburary 1, 2021. All the news outlets are running with a story that Reddit is causing the silver price to spike.  The Wall Street Journal runs story:    If you go to Google News and type in “Reddit Silver” for that date of Feburary 1st, 2021, you’ll get 13 pages of results. This is my favorite one:  Monday, Feburary1, 2021, at 11:53am, Yahoo Finance publishes a story based on a person’s tweet (I’m not kidding, its based on a Tweet):    ##On Tuesday, 3/2/2021, The price of silver ‘corrects.’ Stocks WSB are HOLDING THE LINE on ($GME, $AMC, $BB,) start losing some market value too. So naturally all the new outlets lump Sliver, $GME, $AMC, $BB as one WSB total corridnated Short-Squeeze attack that failed because all these Redditors were stupid.   Tuesday, Forbes:     Ben Martin of the Sunday Times wrote on Tuesday:  \    ##So, Yes, a Redditor did post on WSB about silver. Reuters ran a story about the post, then Metal Industry people wrote articles about the post after Reuters, then The Wall Street Journal said WSB moving away from $GME and into silver, then lazy journalism took over where other reporters just start copying other reporters’ articles  , and then when silver corrected on the same day $GME and $AMC took a hit, all the media blamed us.
Became debt free in one week- too life changing to not paper hand
Will GME actually go up?
I have seen a lot of data here, i don't fully understand. I see a lot of memes and a few conspiracies that may be true may not. I would like to just believe it will actually go up again but i'm sceptic. My feeling is that this are just a lot of people that don't want the hype to end and a ton of confirmation bias. Ofcourse, i can be completely wrong. The data seems convincing, i guess but i don't actually know enough to evaluate that shit, so you could probably convince me of anything using the same data.  So, to the people that aren't too emotional invested in this, not giving a fuck about hedgefounds, diamond hands etc:  Do you think GME will go up again? If so, do you actually think it's going to the moon or does it just go up to like 200 again?  Edit: I think there was a misunderstanding. Don't worry, i didn't buy anything. Just wanted to understand the whole thing better and maybe decide to buy a bit afterwards. I asked because the frontpage suggests that everything will go way up again, which i didn't really believed.

What does buying stock do?
So here is are some questions. Can you buy stock in any company? What does that do to the company?  I am wondering if that is a better act then just buying there products they make. For instance, I'm a big fan of nippon ichi software, if I like the game I played should I buy stock? If a company goes under are you out more then you put in? What is the risk in that situation?  I'm not asking in the since to make a ton of money off it, but more on the level of helping the company. Does buying stock help the company in some way?   I also am wondering what happens if you have a ton of stock in a company. I remember in some older movies if you own the majority of the stock you have say in some of the actions a company makes. Is that actually how that works or is that just movie plot magic?
Dont let others force you to make silly decisions to cover their losses
All the twats on here posting "HOLD THE LINE" and "BUY AT THE DIP" at the end of the day no one knows where the stock is going. And absolutely everyone is in it for the money. The truth is the majority of those who want you to buy and hold GME stock want you to help recover their losses, they seem to think that if retail starts buying and holding it will drive the price up enough to cover their losses. Remember its YOUR money! not THEIRS! If you are on a roll... cash out, buy more, hold or whatever! and don't let others make you feel bad for their own foolish greedy decision making.  Not financial advice, i talk to my goldfish and genuinely believe he talks back to me
Why IRBT might be the next big short squeeze
Let me interrupt the GME gain porn for a second. I know. GME was (and maybe still is) the opportunity of a lifetime. Most of you think it will never happen again. But I am not so sure about that. In the last weeks it became painfully obvious, that hedgefunds have manipulated the market for decades. They have artificially deflated the prices of some companies by excessively shorting their stocks. That left them vulnerable. And we have just started to expose their weakness. While GME was a one-of-a-kind situation, there are still a lot of overshorted stocks out there. It\`s just a matter of time till retail investors (that’s us) will pick the next one.  I think IRBT is a possible candidate for the next short squeeze. It is both fundamentally sound and in the perfect constellation for a squeeze. Here is why.    The Company    iRobot produces the vacuum cleaner Roomba among other household robots. They have a pretty advanced AI and Boomers just love their products. Most importantly, the business is profitable, and the company has grown significantly in the last couple of years. Revenue increased from $656 mil in 2016 all the way to $1214 mil in 2019. For the first three quarters they reported a revenue of $885,6 mil in 2020. In their latest presentation they estimated, their EPS to be around $  for the full year of 2020. This would put the company at a P/E ratio of around 34 at Fridays close. That is not too bad these days. Earnings for the fourth quarter will be released this Wednesday after close. The fourth quarter has always seen a spike in sales due to holiday season. And I think they\`re going to crush expectations. Short Interest data will be updated at the same time.  So we have a profitable company, that is rapidly growing, at a modest price and a potential catalyst. Who the hell would be stupid enough to short this thing?     Yeah, that’s right. Melvin is. Among others…        The Setup    This company has all the potential for an epic squeeze. It is not as ridiculously shorted as GME was, but there are a few other factors in play. Let’s talk about it.  There are   million shares sold short. That’s   of all shares outstanding.   This stock is primarily held by Institutions. The Top 20 hold   of the stocks according to Morningstar. Most of them are issuers of Index Funds. So these shares will not be up for sale anytime soon. Our experience from GME tells us, that this is quite bullish.     IRBT has a market cap of around 3 billion. It is playing in the same league as GME and AMC were before the squeeze.  Furthermore, IRBT is trading at a low volume. Last week there were only a million shares traded per day. This would put the short ratio (days to cover) at about 10. Meaning that shorts would need to buy up the whole volume for two full weeks to cover their positions. It also means, that shorts cannot have covered their positions already.  Due to the low Volume a sudden inflow of buyers would drive the price up instantly. Have a look on the chart at the 27th last month. That was when GME peaked and hedgefunds started to cover their other short positions to rebalance. The stock went up 100% in three days while most other overshorted stocks only increased about 20%. This was probably not the squeeze yet. After the hedgefunds saw GME almost destroy them, they\`ll not sit around waiting for it to explode this time. When the first hedgefund starts to cover, the run to the exit begins. The squeeze will be much faster than GMEs was. I think it will only take two or three days for it to be over.    I want you to know, that none of this is financial advice. I’m not recommending buying this stock. I’m also not suggesting that we should pump it up to fuck Melvin a second time. That would be illegal. All I want to say is that I really like this stock. Oh, and today I ate mothballs for breakfast.   TL;DR:   IRBT       Let’s get ready to Roomba!
Damn gme is a hell of a ride, trying to use the remainder of my account to soften the blow, I think this hit probably damaged my ears or something because I STILL DIDNT HEAR NO BELL
I developed PTSD from GME
Watching the numbers going up and down, seeing your money going away, I had a loss of 80%, from $1500 to $300 (got in late) in GME.   Well, turns out as I was playing a game, where you have to adjust the settings to have the best efficiency of production, defined by product/sec, I was getting ansious and my heart was accelerating... just for watching the numbers increasing and decreasing in game. It fucking sucks I tell you.      (Not so bad as that guy that used his dental school money to buy more GME)      Tldr: lost money AND my sanity on gme
Did I do alright? I swear Im not a bot guys my nephew and his dog got sick and had to be put down, dog made a full recovery though
Investing in Real Estate and the Stock Market – What Should Investors Know?
WSB now looking to short-squeeze Chuck E Cheese Game Tokens.
With a national vaccination plan in place, stay-at-home restrictions will soon be lifted all across the country allowing for mass gatherings and celebrations again. 2021 will be a busy year for Chuck E Cheese as hundreds of thousands of children's birthday parties that were missed last year will be re-celebrated this year at America's top and most germ infested birthday party institution.   Sensing another $GME opportunity, Redditors on the popular subreddit r/wallstreetbets have been buying up Chuck E Cheese game tokens at a staggering rate during the lock down, reducing the supply of available Chuck E Cheese game tokens on the open market. When families return to the quasi-popular pizza place who's mascot is a rat, Redditors hope to sell the tokens back to parents a 16,000% return rate, which the parents will be forced to pay so their crying 7 year old can play Ski Ball.
What other trades are you guys making besides losing money on GME?
All I see is posts for or against GAMESTOP. I don’t really give a fuck about GameStop as I’m only holding my 10 patriotic duty shares. I’m apparently not retarded and sold my 400 shares at 320 on the way back down. Went from 35k to 170k in my account. Thanks wsb.  Can we get back to discussing retarded moves, shitty due diligence and gambling on earnings calls, because that’s the whole reason this sub even exists.
GME shares are worth more than 2500 $ each
I thought a lot about the current GME events, what happened until now, and what could happen in the near future.      Please consider that I'm just a retard and most likely just hate my wife's boyfriend. I'm no investment adviser and I just love this stock.        What we saw until now:    \- In a previous post we saw that two retards limit sell orders of 2500$ and 5000$ were successful.   \- In most media, even the international ones, there is a big emphasis on that GME squeeze is lost.   \- The media also strongly recommend to sell the shares, learn from our mistake, and move on... As if they have our best interest in mind.        What didn't happen until now:    \- The Squeeze  \- Only the retards are currently the ones actively going for the squeeze        My hypothesis:     \-Why only the retards went for the squeeze until now?  \-Why other parties didn't went for the squeeze with us?   \-Why are we encouraged to sell our shares?  \-Who is going to buy the shares we sell? Only HF? Or other POIs?      Imho the only correlation between most parties involved in GME events is greed. And as long as the squeeze doesn't happen, we should hold our shares, especially the ones with lost porn. Most likely they are going to be the ones who will profit the most, as it doesn't make sense for them to sell anyways.   The game is still being played and most likely the ones who are going to profit from this are the most retarded/patient holders.    Holding 140 GME shares. My estimate per share is 2500$ or above.   With RC and the new management at GME 450$ per share by 2023 is anyways reasonable.

but what if we try to invest in GOPRO? (GPRO)
Shares of action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) sank more than 20% at their lows on Friday, and remained down   as of 3:30   EST.   The company announced its fourth-quarter earnings results Thursday night, which showed revenue dropping by more than 32% versus the prior-year period.   So what Though the company highlighted the 28% sequential improvement in revenue versus the third quarter, the seasonally stronger fourth quarter fell short when compared to the 2019 period. For the full year, 2020 revenue dropped by 25% versus 2019.   Now what Though GoPro reported positive earnings for the holiday quarter, it continued its string of annual net losses that started in 2015. Even after earning $  million in the final quarter of 2020, the company lost $  million for the year.   GoPro has been focusing on growing its subscription base and a direct-to-consumer strategy. Subscribers grew to 761,000 at the end of 2020, 52% ahead of the previous quarter, and 145% higher than one year ago. The company said   generated $116 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, almost double the amount of a year ago.  Customers have been spending on more of the company's high-end offerings; cameras with retail prices above $300 represented 91% of quarterly sales. The average selling price to consumers was up 14% to $323, compared to the prior-year period.   GoPro's strategy of higher-value products and subscription services is helping turn its business around. But investors will have to wait another year to see if it's enough to result in a profitable year.

Oh hey fellow retards, I see you hopped onto the stonk train and pulled up to the WSB station. Welcome to the retarded corner of reddit - grab your wife and her boyfriend, put on your special helmets, and take a seat in your timeout chairs. Today we're going to discuss the basics of WSB culture, and a few do's and don'ts.     What exactly is WSB?    We are a sub focused on making million to one odds bets on different meme stonks, typically chosen because of a funny/memelike/autistic ticker or some creatively retarded DD posted by some idiot with no understanding of market fundamentals who likely just barely passed high school (most of us, including myself). As most of us go broke and balls deep into debt from weekly calls, a few of us get incredibly lucky and their gain porn convinces the rest of us to get a second mortgage on our homes. As the crippling debt piles on, we post our losses so that we can show off our huge karma gains to our wife's boyfriend so he thinks we're cool like him. The story  always  ends well.    Is WSB a movement?    No retard. WSB was never intended to be a massive movement, and no the goal of WSB wasn't/isn't to "wage war against the rich". The goal is to become rich, so to wage a war against what we ultimately aim to achieve is rather counterproductive. If you're here because you think we care about/share your political/economic views, you're on the wrong sub  brotatoe . WSB is about getting filthy rich, or ruining your financial situation for a majority of your adult life while trying. We don't aim to "stick it to the man", we all aspire to  BE  the man. If you haven't noticed, even u/MartinShkreli is a mod here.  Emphasis:  We do not care about your political views.                F off.     Didn't WSB intentionally orchestrate the GME short squeeze and collapse of several financial institutions?    Well yes, and no. Yes, the GME short squeeze was a very popular DD being pushed for months - but the reasoning wasn't exactly to wage a war against big financial institutions. The main reason GME was being pushed so hard on here was because people wanted to make so many tendies that they could buy out the Wendy's they work the drive through at. The chaos that ensued because of the shortsqueeze is only an added bonus - Melvin can suck it.     "I only came here to join the movement against Wallstreet..."     F off      Do's and don'ts:    As I mentioned (so many times, here's some rockets in case you skipped everything else above       ), this sub is NOT a political movement, posting your politics on here is not acceptable. No matter what political party is currently on top, there are different plays you can make to get those sweet tendies.   Do not post or promote your pump and dump schemes. Working together is great, what happened with GME was badass - but remember that there's a VERY thin line between teamwork and market manipulation (one of which being highly illegal).  DO enjoy and join in on our culture, call each other retards and autists, talk about your wife being gangbanged by your successful neighbors and you unsuccessfully tryna impress one of her boyfriends. Share your gains/losses - nothing gets me harder than seeing someone lose 40k. Make some ridiculous DD about some obscure company no one has ever heard about, and convince 20 retards to join you because we're all idiots.    LASTLY -  Don't be a loser.                EDIT: Made this more PG so mods will allow it to post

WSB: A current state of affairs
Want some new stupid things to throw money at? Hint: Shrooms
If people think pot is the next thing then they’re 3 years too late. The next thing is Psilocybin. You may know it as shrooms.  There are several companies working on medicines and real world use. States are waking up to this too... as is the federal government.   Several states have legalized shrooms for recreational use and some medicines are working their way through the FDA. Here’s some DD (that isn’t mine):    I have some positions and favs:  $CMPS - one of the biggest fish with a market cap over    $MMEDF - working on medicines and therapeutics with a focus on psychedelics   $SHRMF - working on some bipolar meds and some ketamine treatments (yea they’re bringing ketamine back)   Do your own research. I’m not a financial advisor. I am long these 3 and think they’re the next blue skies field. Happy to answer questions.  Oh and                Edit: I’ve been on Reddit for years and these are my first awards. Thank you so much! Now let’s make some tendies together.  Edit 2: it’s only fair if I post my positions:   CMPS 150 shares 1x 2/19 50c   MMEDF 2000 shares   SHRMF 12000 shares   No idea how these will act tomorrow.  Edit3:   I wanted to give some more reading material for those really interested. This is just to help you form your own opinions and see if this makes sense to you. We can share ideas here but you need to make informed decisions yourself.                  thanks for u/GoldDigger2500 for this article

Investors are Pulling Out of Renaissance Technologies: Is This a Bad Sign for Equities?
Just saw news that investors have pulled 5 billion out of Renaissance Technologies since December 1. (   This is   of the assets under management (   If investors are pulling out of one of the most successful hedge funds of all time, which had annualized returns of 60% for decades, what are they doing with their funds at other funds? Where are they going to put their money?   Is this a sign that money is being moved out equities entirely by institutional and other investors? Or was Renaissance uniquely impacted by the Coronavirus crash, which they say caused their worst ever year in 2020?   Renaissance is perhaps the most celebrated hedge fund of all time and its annualized returns are practically unbelievable. It's hard not to interpret a nearly 5% loss in AUM as a bad sign for equities.   SPY puts?

Small potatoes compared to some, but still holding onto this ride.
GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype.
This isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance.     First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.    I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.    What this isn't: an "I told you so".      I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a "short ladder attack" (for why that's not a rea,   for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road.   _______    What this is: reflecting on the mob    The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting  I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's  , where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.  20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc.   We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.          You can, but should you?    Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.      So, what did Reddit accomplish here?    Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.    This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.    Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.      And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of shitt try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.    .  Thank you for listening to my Ted  Talk                     's        .
GME SI DD - Short Interest Clarification
I've been following the Short Squeeze Season since mid December and I'm interested in everything that has happened. I was trying to find up to date Short Interest values for all of the recent 'reddit/wsb/meme stocks', as CNBC and others like to call them.  I just wanted to share what I have found and I hope the information is valid. I'm not looking to persuade anyone any one way. I'm not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. Did I miss anything? I'm an ape. Moon. Rocket. Diamond Hands.  So I came across the FINRA 2021 Short Interest Reporting Dates, found here:       "FINRA requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month. All short interest positions must be reported by 6   Eastern Time on the second business day after the reporting settlement date designated by FINRA." On January 27th, trading became restricted by a few brokers for GME and other stocks. On January 28th, RH restricted trades for the entire trading session, and many days after. However, on January 29th, firms had to report their short positions. This information will become public on Tuesday, Feb 9th. I'm not sure what time this will happen. Also, I'm not sure what the position will show from the January 29 reports. Were the positions recorded at different times from different firms? Were they recorded at closing hours? 6pm as well? Hard to tell.  Regardless, what I see as important here, is that at some point Tuesday Feb. 9th, we will have an updated Short Interest value. Until then, I wouldn't trust any sites values.   Finviz, which has shown the same 121% short float % for the past 2 weeks? Because I assume they too are awaiting the reports from FINRA. Does Bloomberg Terminal have access to this information somehow? After all, this data was reported on Feb. 2nd. So the information is out there somewhere.  I started a free-trial on:   and from a report on there, I found the short interest values that were reported on Dec. 31, 2020 and Jan. 15, 2021.     I have no idea what the short position will hold for Jan. 29th. I also have no idea how to interpret the Days to cover column. If anyone can provide anymore information I will update this post.    tl/dr:   Short Interest Values should be updated on Tuesday, February 9th. Not sure what time. We'll know for sure if the squeeze is coming by then, if it hasn't happened before then.  edit: GME TO THE FUCKING MOON APES!                   Update:   It looks like there were a reported 21,409,004 shares still shorted on Jan. 29th. Not sure what time that was taken, most likely end of day, or   EST. This report is from

Disclaimer: Not a financial advisor. The below is my opinion. Do your own due diligence.  Thanks to    for making me aware of this stock back at $  It mooned, as he projected.    What is Himax     “Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: HIMX) is a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. Himax is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer electronics devices.

Himax has retained its position as the leading display imaging processing semiconductor solution provider to consumer electronics brands worldwide.”     Q4 ER    They smashed it. Oddly, the company released pre ER Q4 data and everyone just ignored the great news because of reasons. Then Q4 came and their guidance added fuel to the hot numbers.   From the ER press release:  " Q1 2021 Guidance: Revenue to increase by 5% to 10% sequentially, Gross Margin is expected to be 37% to 38%, IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be   cents to   cents, and Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be   cents to   cents."  They are telling you they'll moon. Telling you!    Semiconductor constraints, right? AMD, right?    Again, from the horse's mouth:  "Have   succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021   as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. Expect the   total capacity available to Company to increase quarter by quarter in 2021 and will continue efforts in acquiring more capacity  . Also   secured a meaningful capacity increase is automobile where the global shortage for semiconductor supply is overwhelming  ."  So the company won't face the same constraints. Actually, they'll have more capacity.    Who are their customers    Samsung, LG, Lenovo, Huawei, Panasonic, Amazon, Sony, Mercedes, Jaguar, Asus, FOXCONN (come on), Google, and so many more.

AMC - THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER!
A quick update on new information for all my fellow bag holder apes.  What's the case with AMC? Is the run over? Has the squeeze squozed?  No.  AMC's price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze. People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB.  This, also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC. A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum. Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC. That, accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members, caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance -   FUD.  The number one rule of marketing is "never create high expectations that you cannot meet". Why? Because, while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term, it will damage your brand and your company's success in the long-term. The same rule applies to practically everything else. In AMC's case, high expectation was created, dates were given, and when those expectations were left unmet - novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares.  Accompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right, data manipulation, etc. I personally believe that this is what drove the price down. Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here, but I'd rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations.  Hedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security.  With all of that being said, why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode?  Utilization rate was   on the 8th of February:        And has since dropped to  , which is still quite high.        What this shows us is that about 89% of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed. However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased - from   to    This just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow - recently bought shares.  What else do we know?  We now know, thanks to Fidelity, that retail ownership of the stock is  !!!!          Why's this exciting? Well, if we look at the exciting case of VolksWagen (VW):    The short interest of the stock was about 13%. The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74%. Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply (holders) were willing to give for it. Simply because they can do that.  So hedges have two options, accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock. Or, keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR, which changes literally everyday based on the volume.  Institutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC:  Vanguard -   increase worth, I dunno but they have bought   new shares.  Blackrock - 69% increase worth $   Northern Trust Corp - 41% increase worth $   And many more who bought into the stock recently:        We're also seeing a lot of people reporting that when they attempt to short the stock they are receiving error messages telling them   "This stock is hard to borrow".      Such as Etrade:            And the lightspeed platform:          Which also reported that the available shares to short are 460k with a borrow fee of    Another report from NakedShortReport  shows us that the short volume of AMC was 40% yesterday.        Naked short report collect their data from FINRA. But it's interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21% short volume. I've genuinely lost all hope in them by now.    CONCLUSION    What this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now.  Don't lose hope and hold your positions if you can. If you can't that's fine. Look after yourself first.  This is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of - Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions. This is probably the best stock to train that element.  Invest what you are willing to lose - especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC.    For all of us who are still holding - stay strong. This might prove to be beneficial.   However, this is no guarantee, obviously.  Take everything I've said with a grain of salt and do your own research. I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation.    Let me know what you think!

Attention retards, the future is in psychedelic research companies
I’m in the field neuroscience and pharmaceutical industry. Listen up guys you’re probably wondering hmmm why should I keep and eye out in these stocks. Well the answer is big pharma is going to buy them out after they compete with their current products and win. The entire sector of anti psychotics, anti depressants ssris, mood suppressors, maois, anti anxiety medication, benzos, addiction medication, and Adhd medication are going to be taken out by these companies, and then bought into the big pharma borg.   The evidence is in the scientific studies, which show that these psychedelic and other illicit compound research companies have the most effective cutting edge mental illness treatment on the planet. Ketamine for example is the worlds most effective short term anti depressant. Magic mushrooms are shown to be the worlds most effective treatment at treating treatment resistant depression. Ibogaine is the worlds most effective anti addiction drug for heroin, with 77% of users in one study not relapsing when they didn’t return to their old enviornment. Lsd is shown to be incredibly promising to treat alcohol addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous started out using it actually. Mdma is considered the worlds most promising drug for treated PTSD AND CPTSD. DMT is being used in new trials to treat depression as well with much success.   The thing all these stocks have in common is that companies such as mindmed compass pathways Numinus wellness and others are all researching and gaining patents on these drugs and developing new analogues to patent and sell for insane profits. The future of healthcare is in these drugs. Oh and the growth in this sectors huge. The sector is on track to hit   billion dollars marketshare in 2027. This is the next boom.  TL/DR: Buy companies that do research on dmt ibogaine mdma ketamine lsd and mushrooms.
$DISCA DD
Alright autists, here is a short and sweet DD for $DISCA. Discovery holds a bunch of networks women love to watch, like HG TV, Food Network, house flipping and all that. Recently they created their own streaming service (why not) and stock has responded nicely. $DISCA is up 95% in past 3 months. A portion of this is said to be due to short covering among funds (more on that later) but I disagree. GME squeeze has not picked up until mid January, Disca has been ripping since mid November.  Among all free apps in Apple universe, it has been moving between 50th and 100th place for the past couple weeks in downloads, and have been on top 10 rankings for android for a while.   Trading at a 20 P/E and 7x FCF compared to its competitors you could say its relatively cheap.   Now here are the catalysts, Michael Bury owns 500k shares of this beauty. I'm sure he did more DD than me, so betting on big fella to find value for me.  It is the most shorted stock in SP500 and trades at a 50% valuation discount. Discovery+ went live early January and earnings report is due March 1st, I expect even if they announce mediocre numbers, stock should pick up pace due to low valuation.  As you all are aware, growth expectation is everything in this market. Down is up, up is up, everything makes money.  I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you to buy the stonk, I just like the stonk myself. Couldnt care less what y'all decide to do.   As of the day of this post I’m long 1/2022 $60 and $70 calls, also $  3/19/2021 calls and planning to hold until mid year at least.  Godspeed
AMC GOOD LONG TERM? (Buy/Hold)
Edit: I am aware of the possible squeeze incoming and am already in possession of 7 amc   I just really UNIRONICALLY like the stock  Edit 2: Someone let me know that I had made a clerical error, 99 billion should have been   billion  Hello, I have been a lurker of the sub for just over 2 years, this is my first DD so please don't hold back and let me know what my blind spots are.  AMC is currently trading at   when im writing this and I see it possibly going a little lower but I do believe that ~ 7$ is a good price for this stock considering the rebound it could make in the coming months/years.  AMC and theaters in general are a very important part of American culture, or at least have been for a long time, covid could change all of this I am aware; however I do not believe that hollywood is willing to give up a   Billion dollar a year industry because someone ate batman. In 2019 theaters generated an estimated revenue of   this number fell harshly and predictibly due to Covid laws, but their alternative was something no one even considered trying. Paying $30 to watch a movie via a streaming platform... This is something I think even idiots look at and think "wow this is a rip", and there is no alternative to this as movie studios simply cannot rely on subscription revenue to create a movie that can survive by todays standards.  One of the major things about theaters that draws people in is the sheer quality of the tech, where as we could spend 10 or 20 thousand on a tv and sound system, these theaters spend that per speaker, for an uncompromised experiance unobtainable at home without cutting edge and expensive technology that is by no means "popular" or "accessible".  My personal opinion is that AMC will probably climb past the 10$ mark when they can resume normal operation, me and all of my friends have been talking about theaters and how they are in a "make-it-or-break-it" scenario, this is probably my biggest worry in terms of this stock, there is a VERY real chance that people will simply not care about theaters after all this is over, but I am counting on Hollywood to not let that happen, I believe they would fight tooth, nail, and every apendage they had to keep theaters in America.  ACTUAL DD:  Old Financials: Prior to COVID-19, AMC had found itself in a small rut of sorts, their overall revenue was only up .19%, they were spending much more on advertisements than usual and they were also dealing with a lower than average operating income (down   2018-2019) and they finished out the year in debt, they had lost    New Financials: 2020 has been an absolute shit show for AMC, they are down across the board by > 90%, and their last reported operating income in september was   and the finished the year out   in the red. Q1 2020 obviously had lessened effects on the company as the US was undecided for a while on how seriously we were going to take it. Their Gross profits have also fallen: Q4 (2019):   - (  Q1 (2020):   - (  Q2 (2020):   - (  Q3 (2020):   - (  It is also worth mentioning their net income across the quarters has went from   in Q4 2019 to   Q3 2020  OPINION: I think that AMC is currently in a dangerous predicament in terms of hemmoraging money each quarter, however I do believe that Hollywood has enough of a vested interest to turn this into a possibly money maker. No one is calling for theaters to go away, people like them and they enjoy the atmosphere that comes with the experiance, we love the memes of a 20$ popcorn and a 50$ soda, but I really believe Americans like the cinema.  Position: 20 Jan 23  $ call I belive in AMC long-term (at least for the next few years), I am very much so considering a LEAPs position on AMC, I wouldn't be mad being stuck with 100 shares of AMC, and considering the risk and reward, my breakeven is $ , I really believe that sometime between now and 2023 AMC will at LEAST go to  , hopefully higher, but if lower than its DIAMOND HANDS INTO THE GROUND.  TLDR: AMC has issues and its a gamble, but goddamnit I like it  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY FALLACIES, LOGICAL ERRORS, OR ANY OUTSTANDING MISTAKES THIS IS MY FIRST DD AND I WANT BECOME A MORE ACTIVE USER. I AM HERE TO LEARN AND MAKE A LITTLE MONEY, AND ANY ADVICE YOU GIVE IS MUCH APPRECIATED
The sub is divided and you're creating a cult.
Hey guys, I've been following WSB for years now, but only recently started posting.  I'm worried that the sub is getting divided because of extremists on both sides of the whole GME saga. There's people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like "short squeeze," "counterfeit shares," learning what a Bloomberg terminal is etc etc. Listen - that's amazing. I love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.  What I worry about is that BECAUSE people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they're the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. One one of the recent top posts was comparing the GME and AMC charts, saying how similar they were. Everyone in the comments was screaming "MAHNEEPULASHIONNNNNN." COULD it have been manipulation? I mean... yes... But market   correlation   is very, very common and normal. I don't think I need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. Now, I'm not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as I don't know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn't mean shit.  PLEASE do your research before posting this shit. This is why the vets are pissed at all the GME pumping: it's in large by people who don't know what they're talking about. Not everyone who's done with GME is a Melvin bot, as much as you'd like to believe. It's all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. I do hold some GME and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. If you have a thesis that you believe in, you should ALWAYS know the bearish case too. Consider what the other side is saying too. You'll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you'll realize maybe you were wrong.  The other side of the story is the OGs who have also been around for years. I see why you're pissed. The sub has changed tremendously over the last month. At the same time, I want you guys to also remember that this GME thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. It's not exactly the essence of WSB to teach people (lol) BUT if you just leave comments saying "you're an idiot." or "you should have sold like I did retard" you're only making the problem worse.  If you've been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. Then we can continue losing money together in peace.  Tl;dr: pleas wsb again
Market inefficiencies, MOASS and you. A discussion of how the market is broken and what it means for us.
So the last 2 weeks have been interesting to say the least for the market. A basket of WAY over shorted retail stocks almost crashed the market, Rh fucked 80% of the sub, and now there is going to be Congressional and regulatory inquiries. So instead of yet another gme go brrrr post, I would rather discuss the long term implications of all this and just how broken the market is.   There is almost assuredly regulation that will come of this. What that looks like we don't know yet. But because the PDT rule exists I am pretty sure of that. Ironically the rule that is "meant to protect" retail definitely cost me more money when I was starting, by trying to avoid strikes, then any crazy yolo's.   That brings us to the first point to consider. Retail options trading. I am willing to bet large sums of money they're going to come after it. And while there is certainly an increase in retail options trading, do we really have the effect that they will claim we have? Sure it can swing smaller stocks, but its not gonna do a thing to the big boys. Remember how  short lived that was on MSFT? Mass amounts of capital that we couldn't possibly bring to market are needed for that. Softbank did it though, and that was a big dick move, especially because they are Asian and not known for packing schmeat.   The next point to consider is what actually almost crashed the market. HF leverage. They were getting absolutely destroyed on a handful of heavily shorted stocks to the point it caused the largest alpha unwind in recent history.                     It might make investors feel good to see net $0 on a balance sheet and assume there is no risk. But the reality is there is a gross $30 exposure per dollar because they are levered to the tits. This being wsb, I respect that. But it was not retail that over-levered on crowded shorts that had to unwind longs in a state of sheer panic to cover or close.   The market did not actually crash this time though, and there is probably some decent upside in going long right now.         Maybe, just maybe its time to keep a closer eye on just how much leverage the HF's and IB's are using? These types of events are happening more often than in the past. The bankers and fund folk love to say that no ones stress tests their book for multiple sigma moves like this. Maybe they should start to because its the 5th such event in 20 years ( dot com, 2008, Volmageddon, covid crash, and now this).     I pretty much wrote this whole thing because I would really like to see some intelligent discussion here again, and I am curious to see how fucked others think retail trading as a whole is when the suits do finally get together to discuss this. I gave you graphs, info and talking points, so lets discuss.

MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD
Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I’m gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there’s more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,  Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I’m sure you’ve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol’ USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the “betting” portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I’m starting top down with this masterpiece.   Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS.   Karsan - I can’t see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it’s a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his   and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor.   Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was “zero-emission”. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they’ll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren’t all that practical or possible.   The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there’s no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‘87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process.   Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy’s current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven’t noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don’t see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they’re gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that’s currently burning cash like it’s their fucking job.   THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021.   Enough about the contract though, let’s talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn’t talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there’s a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect).   Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she’s grown her holding to over   shares and she’s not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract.   Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there’s another form of revenue the company has going for it.   It’s a growth stock with a lot of potential and it’s logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles.   Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I’ve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there’s plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that’s why we’re all here right?   Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16.   Let’s ride this horse to tendy town fellas 🤝  Edit: I’m a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah  EDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.  Edit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.  Edit 4 -       (FOR THE VISUAL LEARNING RETARDS)  Edit 5 - TLDR: WKHS is 100% American made EV Last Mile Delivery Vehicle. Has Patents pending for its drone delivery tech. Frontrunner for USPS   Government Fleet Contract (NGDV Contract). Heavy institutional ownership including BAE Cathie Wood. 30% Short Float to be squeezed on contract announcement.

I just read the DD on WSB $GME misinformation, I still think it can moon but... $AMC 👀
So I just read the detailed posts about $GME DD and I saw a few of you join in on the discussion with a thought that’s certainly crossed my own mind more than once. The specific part of the discussion I’ll highlight is  whether or not hedge funds or others in power manipulated the market by influencing the closure of trades on platforms such as Robinhood . Like many of you, I almost immediately believed that this was a direct attack on retail to prevent any astronomical effect on $GME, but later changed my stance to the following and see that many of you share this stance too, based on your own DD:    the attack was never meant to prevent $GME from exploding, $GME was a distraction from the true threat, $AMC    Now before you downvote I will say that I still think $GME had potential to reach new heights based on my own DD, and it has nothing to do with the “177% float” we’re not exactly sure about. However, I personally believe $AMC has more practical long term potential. It was almost certain $AMC would be going out of business, which was good news for a lot of shorts—a no-brainer, if you will. The success of the $GME squeeze scared the funds into avoiding a part 2 at all costs, $AMC surpassing ~$30 and staying there would be in direct contrast to so. many. short. positions. Now, I’m sure a lot of you (if not most of you) are more experienced, more talented, smarter traders than myself, but this remains common sense to me which is why I still maintain this opinion: at a time (covid) when theaters were ghost towns, the end wasn’t even remotely in sight, and the theater industry already in decline—when theaters were arguably at an all time low, imagine what might happen if the stock price was virally launched into heights unseen since A YEAR before the pandemic. Based on the simple principals of trading I was introduced to, I’m inclined to believe this would destroy many, many plans and have a historical affect on the price of an $AMC share.  Tell me if I’m wrong through, tell me I’m missing something. Tell me that $  isn’t a killer deal for what might be the most undervalued stock of the year, amidst an already crazy year. Please, someone convince me not to put a...  thrilling ... amount of money on $AMC at open. I want to be wrong so you save me the time I’ll spend on this subreddit and Twitter these next few months.  On the other hand though... is it $AMC’s time to shine? Why?
I'll just leave this here
Retard apes, I hereby present you the #1 Stock of 2021  - RDFN
Fellow autists,  You heard it here 1st. Redfin will be the #1 stock of 2021.  That's right, that shitty red website that your wife's bf keeps browsing while he hogs your shitty Wi-Fi (cause you can no longer afford the premium on decent internet service due to GME losses) is gonna be the gangbuster stock of 2021.  Why? As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.  1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35 2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the  medium  term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings. Redfin is the Netflix of real estate due to its amazing website, customer engagement and disruptive fee schedule (who the F wants to pay   to sell their home when you can pay   I sure don't) 3. Traffic to Redfin is skyrocketing. For those genius apes capable of interpreting a super simple graph here it is:   See that? ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't. 4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now. Or 1/2 a Gamestop if you bought at $250 and still holding like a true retarded hero.     TLDR: Sold a f ton of puts on  Jan 22 and used the proceeds those to buy 85, 90 and 120 calls expiring in Jan 22. Price target for 2021 is $400. Dead serious here. Or for you Papa Elon fans, $420 and funding secured.  Proof:    Disclaimer: Since everyone now seems to think we do investing here let me dispel false notions. I have no fuking clue if this is gonna work out and judging by past performance I'm thinking I'm at a solid 99% chance of losing money. This is not investment advice and chances are I'll be back at flipping burgers when I lose all my money in yet another crazy idea.
Suggestion / Request for this subreddit
Given the large daily volume of posts, especially when there is one or more highly active stocks, would it be possible to have a sticky post that summarizes the different tickers that have been discussed?   For each ticker, then perhaps a small "overview blurb" with some sort of sentiment analysis?  (  trend up / down / buy / hold /run away)  I'm not entirely sure how to manage such a post, but it seems like it could be really helpful to ensure nothing gets buried by the other posts.

A Brief History of the GME Short
Rocket Companies (RKT) DD - An Undervalued Gem
Disclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I’m not a professional, I’m not even an amateur, this is a Wendy’s.    Sources used:   RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.    Summary    Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.    RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future   RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.   The RKT “ecosystem” provides a “full cycle” solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it’s an app, it’s online, it’s doable from home and it’s not complicated. There’s an inherent advantage in what they’re doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that’s complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there’s a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.   RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.   RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).   RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they’re doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That’s a unique and potent combination in my opinion.   RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That’s an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.    Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company    The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $  per share.   This estimate gives a forward-looking P/E ratio of just over   The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces,  even compared to the financial/mortgage sector . What’s key here is, I don’t think that’s really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.   Let’s assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $  eps.   That would put its fair value      right now      at $  per share.   I think it’s worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it’s really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.     Key Point - Catalysts    This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I’m buying shares, I’m selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don’t know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.  Supporting information and background follows.    The Business    RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:   Home Financing     Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent “public facing” part of the Rocket ecosystem.   Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as “supporting infrastructure” to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.    Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The “business end” in my simple understanding of the world.    Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.   Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada   Edison Financial - Basically the “front end” of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.   Home Sale and Search     Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.   For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it’s absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.   Auto & Personal Financing     Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.   Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.   Media     Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.   Lower My Bills - this company is basically a “portal” business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.   Services & Technology Development     Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.   Rock Central - I will generalize this as “business support”. HR, administration, etc.   Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.    Recent Acquisitions    RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (  Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they’re the ones leading that charge.    Management    I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list for 17 consecutive years.    Financials and Growth    When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don’t want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here’s a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:  $  billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.   From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $  for the quarter vs $  expected.   Net income was $  billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.  Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.  Net rate lock volume was $  Billion (101% growth).  RKT has brought in $  billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.   That’s awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with   $  cash on hand  . That’s great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.  RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is   the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.  Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They’ll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don’t love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.  Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I’m not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It’s nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:       I don’t believe that fair value estimate for an instant  , but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it’s also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.    Product Channels    RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don’t lie:    Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($  closed loan volume)   Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($  closed volume)      Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)  The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.    Current Market and outlook    Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is   (   I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.  Here’s some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.    Positions  : RKT shares. Cost basis of $

Exessive Trading Volumes In Meme Stocks?
In the following CNBC article (  RH CEO Vlad Tenev stated:  “With a lot of concentrated activity in some of these stocks,\[...\]”.  In the same article the journalist writes " Robinhood has experienced unprecedented high volume of trading".  In the attached image I computed a comparison between NIO (which according some brokers was one of the most traded stocks recently) and GME volumes among the period that goes from the 02/Jan/20 to the 05/Feb/21.  It is very easy to notice that the spikes in volumes for GME are not even remotley close to the spikes in NIO. On the period I considered the maximun daily volume for GME, which occures on the 22/Jan/21, is just the 45% of the NIO's maximum daily volume of 577,185,100.  Also, considerind the maximum 3-day rolling sum of volumes GME is just the 41% of the NIO's above 1 bln exchanged shares.  Computing percentage variations as LN(volumes\_d/volumes\_d-1) GME shows the maximum peak on 314% but above NIO of only 43% and not even in the hottest days of January 2021, but  around October 2021.  Is it true that RH had to deal with huge volums of trading activity in GME?  Feel free to consider my quick analysis as tons of bullshits, but I will hold my tiny-dick position of  @ 3 \~ avg 150

$USAC is a good short and long term play
USAC is facilitates the transport and processing of natural gas and crude oil production. With the economy opening up after COVID, there's no way there won't be a surge in the need for oil. This is even more true for natural gas which is used in energy production, giving USAC a solid boost.  At present, USAC is trading below $15, where before the start of the pandemic it was trading at highs of around 18, representing about a 20% gain. The stock has had steadily increasing profit margins over the last 3 years, increasing despite the pandemic, from -96% to 5%. The stock has had its dividends increase over the past 3 years as well, and now provides a relatively stable dividend yield of   per annum.  From a technical standpoint the stock is quite strong. It has good upward momentum and has recently broken above its 20 day moving average (maroon). The ichimoku cloud is currently below the price and green (lead 1 (light green) is above lead 2(red)), and the lagging span (dark green line) is above the price, suggesting strong support for continued upward movement of the stock in the future.        I would argue that this stock is a relatively good short and long term play. It's good for playing short term recovery of the stock to pre-pandemic highs. It's also good for playing on the massive influx of energy demand once things start to return to normal, with the support of good momentum on its side. In the long run, boomers could even make decent profits from the growing dividend yield of this stock.     TLDR; USAC is a natural gas and energy stock currently selling 20% below pre-pandemic highs, that also offers good dividends (stable   yield). Good prospects based on increased energy consumption once the economy reopens.  Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I do not certify any of the information presented is accurate. This is my opinion, I am not holding any positions in this play at present.

Mistakes were made
Prevented ... well significantly reduced demand precluding  selling  GME at Fidelity due to Robin Hood restrictions.
I had a limit sell order in at Fidelity on the afternoon of January 28, 2021.  (  🏽 hate on me if you want to, at some point we are supposed to recognize gains and then sell ... I was selling most but not all shares).  I saw GME spiking and put in a sell order far under the real-time price ... $20 below the then-current price, just to make sure the trade would happen and I could be done with it.   That was the moment that Robin Hood restricted buying.  So even though Fidelity didn’t restrict trading, the RH incident shut down my part of the market too because suddenly demand plummeted.  Will this type of situation be considered/addressed in the hearings / class action regarding Robin Hood?  Edit:  thanks for the advice and even a couple of awards!  Very kind of you all!
Blatant Mistakes in Almost All of WSB's DD Over the Past Week
There have been quite a few posts over the past 2 weeks claiming some absurd things with very little proof.        Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.           Number 1: "15   § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)"       >       This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a "short ladder attack", "ladder attack", or "short attack" fall into this. "Short ladder attacks" and "ladder attacks" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.     This is what a short attack is:        >             >         Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's "research" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say "short attack" they mean something completely different from the actual definition.       Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a "short ladder attack" or "ladder attack" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big.          Number 2: "GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze"         >          >I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.         I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.          ~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~      ~~I go more in depth about that here:~~ ~~       EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:                 Number 3: "Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not."          >         Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance.               Number 4: " "            >           Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the "CounterfeitingStock" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.            Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious.                Number 5: "How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's   Million Outstanding"      >      Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others.          OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here :                             Number 6: "GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers."               >            So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that "177% of float held" means the same as "177% short interest". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here:      > ,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.            Number 7: "S3 Partner's "S3 SI% of Float" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why"        >          I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom:         Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way.          Number 8: "It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers"       >      The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here:         There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.        TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.            EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:           >             >           >A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs "caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that "greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales."         To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.      The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.              EDIT #2 - 3:45 PM: First piece of hatemail:   Thought it might give someone a laugh.           EDIT #3 was written above after the 2nd example.
GME historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events
Full disclosure, stolen from r/options.  A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME TLDR: Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit) I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now: One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs (  Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: /r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here /r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting. I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this   “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. A fail may also result from “naked” short selling.” Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time. According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities. Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price. (Source:   In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent "irrational exuberance and bubbles. But when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.” Mr Cox also “referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “a tool to drive down a company's stock price" and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in Regulation SHO" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote /r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) (source for SEC Chairman’s words:   As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted  ,9171,1126706-3,  but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008   I also read ‘One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create "phantom" or "counterfeit" shares, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and artificially depressing the share price’”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a "push" into extinction from "a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling". (Source:   All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze. On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of   billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious. Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars (  . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least. Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $  billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. These "failures to deliver" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices.” (Source:   Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is   and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source:   "It has been alleged in tens or hundreds of lawsuits that the DTCC and its Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading. (Source:   As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is   in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting   on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day. From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. This "phantom stock" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.” (source:   From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:  GME shorts engaged in   naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122%    GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs (/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close  As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float  The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares  Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the   naked shorting happening in GME  There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.  Also, a compelling theory put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read

$TAK - Sitting flat, why no TAKe off? - Big $ARK buys + $NVAX and $MRNA Covid Collabs in Japan
What am I missing with $TAK?  I'm relatively new to trading (after years of boomer ETFing).  So, I'm hoping that folks can shine some light on my blind spots.  Takeda caught my attention after seeing recent DD by u/phamalam and others highlighting ARK's aggressive buys in recent months and during this week's dip (along with other tasty $TAK bits).  c \_pharmaceutical\_co\_tak\_the\_undervalued\_arkg/     TAK is handling local Japan production and commmercialization of the NVAX covid vaccine.  NVAX has skyrocketed recently.  TAK is down \~10% in the same time frame.  TAK is also collaborating with Moderna for its covid vaccine roll-out in Japan.  MRNA is way up over the past month.  Again, $TAK is flat/down.  TAK's Feb. 4 earnings report looks solid (to this newb).     On Fri., Feb. 12, TAK will be presenting  Phase 3 data for TAK-620 after already revealing solid top-line findings for the study.  It all looks mighty enticing, but surely I'm missing something.  What's holding this rocket back?  \ Certainly not financial advice, looking for insight from the less smooth-brained - holding a handful of shares and ATM calls for Feb through Jan 22\
$VSTO DD- A great value play (Vista Outdoors)
TLDR: Ammo sales/backorders are currently the highest they have ever been, and the market has not reacted yet    Let me start by saying that I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. However, I am a “gun guy” and regularly shoot a lot (~20,000 rounds a year) and compete in shooting sports (USPSA, 3 gun, Steel Challenge, etc). I hold 100 shares of VSTO as well as 10x Feb 19 $35c and 2x Jun 19 $35c. I plan to buy more shares on any dips below $30, and I will explain why.   Some background: In case you are as unaware as the cuck analysts on Wall Street apparently are, there is a nationwide gun and ammo shortage. Why do you care? The company Vista Outdoors (VSTO) is publicly traded on the NYSE. VSTO owns the ammo manufacturers Federal Ammunition, CCI, Blazer, Speer, American Eagle, and they just bought Remington’s ammunition plant after they went bankrupt. (imagine going bankrupt during the largest gun/ammo demand period in history, lmao). Besides ammo, they also make primers, brass, and other components. Primers are even harder to get than loaded ammo right now, because the manufacturers are using the primers to service their own needs first. The wide consensus across the industry is that things won’t return to “normal” (  you can walk in a gun store or go online and buy ammo/primers at normal prices) for at least several years. VSTO owns the largest market share of American ammo manufacturing, followed by Winchester (Olin Corporation, OLN).   The fundamentals: First and foremost, VSTO is a value investment. Some key metrics that make it a buy IMO (taken from ETrade data):  Price to sales:   (this means you are paying 86 cents for $1 of sales, that’s insane in a cyclical industry) Price to book:   Price to cash flow:   And most importantly: Price to earnings. Now, the current number is   This is including the quarter from a year/9 months ago where they barely turned a profit (Trump was still president, no coronavirus, no nationwide political unrest, etc).   Looking forward: Forward P/E is difficult to estimate due to lack of analyst coverage, but if you look at the last two quarters and push forward only six months at the same/similar earnings (approx. $1 per share), you get a forward P/E of  !! For the TA retards, if you look at historical charts, you will note that VSTO traded at $44-$50 throughout the tail end of the Obama presidency. Note that those prices were maintained when they were reporting EPS of approx..   cents per share. Once Trump was elected and ammo demanded dropped off significantly, the stock price got hammered. (Again, they just reported two quarters in a row of over $1 per share in earnings.)   Ammo demand: according to shooting podcasts and other industry media I follow, Federal alone has over $1 BILLION worth of back orders right now. Other reports state that they currently have more outstanding orders than they got during the ENTIRE 8 year Obama presidency. Do the math for what that will look like once the market picks up on this. Couple that with that fact that gun sales have been skyrocketing for the last year. New gun owners=more people buying ammo   Risks: Biden administration passing/signing HR 127 into law, which introduces a shitload of retarded restrictions on ammo purchases by consumers. However, this will cause an even greater near-term spike in demand  Copper and lead prices continue to rise in relation to the inflated dollar (low risk, generally when suppliers raise prices the ammo manufacturers raise their prices too)  These are the reasons I think VSTO is the superior play on the ammo shortage- opposed to OLN, which is a much smaller market share, less profitable, and lower quality ammo in general, and P O W W, which I had never heard of until a week ago, and I still can’t figure out what brands of ammo they actually own (thats a big red flag)

Y’all sleeping on Domino’s Pizza DPZ
DPZ has earnings coming up on 2/25. Looking at its pass 3 earnings it normally starts to run about 3 weeks before earnings, which would be about now.   It likes to stay around $370-390 then shoots to $420~ around earnings. Super Bowl weekend is gonna cause a spike in sales too.   Buying calls for the run up is the play here. Their price normally peaks the week before earnings so 2/19 expiry is probably better since it’s cheaper will offer higher returns.   Don’t be so fixated on one or two tickers that you miss out on other opportunities. I’ve made money on Pypl earnings and SNE recently.   $410c 02/19  Glta

Blackrock, the largest asset manager in the world, increased their ownership of Zynga to   last week
Why is this of note?   Chinese capital firm Keybanc reported last month that Tencent is raising large amounts of money for a purchase, with Zynga being among the possible targets.     Blackrock and Tencent are already working together on ways for Tencent to gain more market share in China.     So, why does the 5% matter?   If you own a single share in a stock, you can have voting rights when it comes to major decisions the company makes. The more shares you have, the more your vote counts. If you own more than 5%, you get special voting rights and a 5% or more share-ownership signifies that the owner intends to be an active participant in the stock, rather than a passive one.  In addition, dark pools have been active on Zynga for months now with large purchases coming in almost daily. For those who don't know about dark pools, this is a quick primer:     I'm thinking Blackrock wants to make sure it gets a say in any decision regarding Zynga and they've been doing it as quietly as possible.  Zynga stock also just happens to have broken above its high of    Earnings are this Wednesday, Feb 10, after the bell, and it also presents at two conferences on Feb 11th and March 3.   Zynga is a sleeper, but it won't be for long.  I'm in 2/26 12C    Edit: Link to chart

The future of wallstreetbets.
At some point in the future if this sub is ever to continue in its previous form,  we will need to restrict the GME posts to a daily super thread.  Most likely this stock will make a painful downward spiral back to sub 20 and the bag holders will become more and more desperate to get one more pump, which will lead to more and more sad and desperate posts.     Yes I know,  I'm a hedge fund shill trying to steal your 40 shares.....
Starting 2022 movie theaters, such as AMC, will be able to own streaming services and streaming services such as Netflix will be able to own theaters.
Paramount vs United States was an anti-trust decree that prohibited movie theaters from producing their own movies or production companies from owning movie theaters. The court granted the DOJ's motion to lift the decrees on August 7, 2020, starting a two-year sunset termination period of the decrees. This might be good news for struggling movie theaters such as AMC, as they can now be acquired by Amazon or Netflix without violating any anti-trust laws.

My crowning achievement
I received a lot of positive feedback on my ROXG DD yesterday, so I thought I would share my email response from their investor relations team regarding political risk in African Mining Operations.
Again, please note this is an investor relations team, who's job it is to inform but also encourage investors. I agree with his sentiment on African (region specific) mining and the risk levels but please do your own dd before purchasing mining stock which can be very volatile.  >Thu, Feb 11, 7:33 PMHi \ \ \ \ \ \ ,   >   >It is a question we receive a lot, so here are my candid, and somewhat long-winded, thoughts:   >   >These concerns typically are raised by North American investors versus UK based investors, which I believe at a base level is due to geography and familiarity: North American investors will willing invest in mining companies in South America, while UK investors prefer investing in Africa and shun South America.   >   >I have to say, after many years in this business, I am on the side of UK investors. South America has a long track record of governments imposing new royalties and taxation regimes (let alone nationalization) on mining, while Africa – or more importantly, the right regions of Africa – should be considered among the most desirable regions for investing in mining in the world.   >   >A key phrase above is “the right regions in Africa”, as for an investor to be “apprehensive to invest in mining in Africa” is almost akin to an investor saying they are “apprehensive of investing in mining in the Americas”. There is no doubt there are countries in Africa that are questionable, but West Africa has a long established history now of being very pro-mining. I believe it has been 40 years since one of the countries, Ghana, returned from a 15 year experiment of nationalization that failed as mining output cratered – as mining is a people-intensive business that requires skills and capital.   >   >If you look at the recent history, countries in West Africa like Burkina Faso, Mali, Cote d’Ivoire, and Senegal have profited immensely from mining and since adopting commercial mining codes that reflect internationally accepted standards (in Mali’s case 30 years ago), this has resulted in significant foreign investment in the gold sector and gold tax receipts to the governments. The fact is that mining is a critical backbone of these economies, and if you look at the history there is very little of what you see in South America. Governments, and more importantly, local communities are very welcoming of mining (done the right way by companies that adhere to first world environmental standards).   >   >In Burkina Faso, where our producing Yaramoko mine is, mining revenue contributes approximately 16% of the total government revenue. This is poor country that relies on the income of mining and the skills and career development that come with it. Generally in mining, for every $1 generated by mining an additional $3+ are generated elsewhere in the economy, so the impact of mining to these economies are even higher. Therefore, it stands to reason that these countries would not want to rock the boat – which is all fine and well when saying that – but you can look at their track records to see this is put into practice.   >   >Our Yaramoko mine, from initial drill hole to production, was 5 years. There is nowhere else in the world that you can see projects move ahead this quickly. Our next mine, Séguéla, which will be coming online next year (\~4 years from initial resource) and which has the potential to more than double our production and cash flow – without having to raise a share since we can fund it from our operations – received its Environmental Approval in September last year and the Mining Permit in December. This will be one of the highest grade open pit mines in Africa, and as a testament to the government and local communities buy-in, the Government of Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) approved the mine in 8 months. This is not because we cut any corners, as we adhere to IFC Performance Standards and the Equator Principles, but the government and people want these projects. Notably, when we acquired the project in April 2019 from Newcrest, the mining minister of Burkina Faso wrote to their equal in Cote d’Ivoire to recommend they approve the acquisition, voicing their support for Roxgold’a contribution towards socio-economic development in Burkina Faso.   >   >On a political front, both Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire recently had elections in late 2020, with both incumbent retaining their seats. This means we have another 4 years in both countries until the next election cycle. Naturally, elections in Africa and West Africa always carry some headline risk, so getting these events behind us should alleviate some concerns from investors. However, not to keep hitting this point, but even political turmoil in West Africa has had little effect on mining in these countries. Look at Mali, which had a coup in August, and not one mining company has been affected, as Mali knows it is in the country’s best interest to keep the gold mines running.   >   >On a monetary policy front, these countries use the West Africa CFA Franc, which is pegged to the Euro, and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (an agreement among countries in West Africa) have aligned their fiscal and monetary policies and have an agreement to promote regional economic integration.   >   >Finally, the reason you want to look at West African miners once you accept the jurisdictional risk, is that the Birimian Gold Belt has been the most prolific region in the world for gold discoveries in the last 15 years. There has been the discovery of over 75 million ounces of gold in the past 15 years, with almost 50% located in Burkina Faso – and Cote d’Ivoire is considered to be underexplored historically which is why there has been a rush of investment there. We are in the right jurisdiction, and have the cash flow producing power to drive growth organically without needing to dilute shareholders. As Séguéla moves forward, and investors start to recognize the impact this will have on our cash flows, we are confident our share price will step in line with our earnings growth. Meanwhile, we continue to drill away at Boussoura, which is in the heart of the Birimian Belt and has been returning intriguing results that have us now believing we have a 3rd project to put in our pipeline of development.   >   >Roxgold continues to trade at a discount to our peers, as the average investor still sees us as a single asset producer with the one mine in Burkina Faso. In the next 18 months, we will be multi-asset producer out of Burkina Faso and Cote d’Ivoire with an exceptional exploration portfolio in the right jurisdiction to move projects ahead quickly.   >   >Hope that was not too lengthy.   >   >Regards,       EDIT: TLDR:   According to the investor relations team, African mining projects are safer than South American, the political climate is stable (in their area) and has been for a few decades. The regions that ROXG mines and explores currently do not want to hinder the mining industry as it is a huge economy driver in their countries.
A day on Wall St.
Don’t risk what you can’t lose.
I am not a professional investor, but I have been watching this community YOLO for over a year. This is just my personal take but the people telling everyone to sell, and calling people bag holders, don’t realize that you don’t risk what you can’t lose. The people here putting hundreds of thousands in, have the ability to lose this cash and be okay. It’s fun, it’s risky, but sometimes extremely rewarding.   No one was ever asking you to put in your life savings into the hands of WSB. I can understand why some people are mad. We all see the same hot posts, what you take away from a DD post is YOUR responsibility. No actual WSB member lied to you or tricked you, just told you what they think is gonna work. The fact is though, there are 100% shady tactics going on behind the scenes between the billionaire hedge funds. Anyone who thinks that the rich people aren’t doing everything they can to make sure we do not put them in a position like a couple weeks ago again; are ridiculous.   The people on this subreddit are the same as you and me, random people coming together to try and make money. I have no clue how to invest or what a good stock is, that’s why we are here. The ability to influence the market , however small, is possible with our community. We saw what happened when reddit focused on GME, but we didn’t expect the repercussions from the hedge funds.   However, the main point is this. We are not here risking the money we need to pay rent, would you bet your life savings on the super bowl? If you find good DD and believe in a stock, put your money in and be PATIENT.   Tl;Dr - Do NOT bet what you can’t lose. No real member is trying to trick you. There are billionaires going against us.
Some Small US Semiconductor Stocks You May Not Know About
I know you all seem to be mostly into video games, weed, and rainbow colored keyboards, but businesses make many more things than that. One thing they make and is in insanely high demand right now are semiconductors, little things that act as both conductors and insulators and make all your electronics do electronic things.  Trust me, they are very important.  Some of you have no doubt seen $AMD, $NVDA, and $MU on here before. I am sure you have heard of Texas Instruments, since they made the calculators you played Pac-Man and Drug Lord on in high school.  Anyway, for people like me who have many people depending on them for food and shelter and lack the testicular fortitude or smooth brain cells to throw thousands of dollars at one company, here are some more affordable companies based in the US and poised to grow in the coming months/years as demand skyrockets and supply lags behind.    MaxLinear $MXL  : These guys just keep growing and beating all of their earnings and revenue targets, net revenue up 24% in Q4 of 2020, and have beaten earnings in 6 straight quarters. Their RoE routinely beats the competition, and their projected sales growth is good.    Chip_MOS $I_MO_S  : (Sorry for the formatting, this guy is just under 1B cap, but did not want to leave it out) Just another small company with good financials and ever increasing sales/revenues, the latter up 24% in January. They have consistently good P/E and P/S ratios, and even offer a pretty generous dividend if you are into that kind of thing.    Advanced Energy Industries $AEIS  : If you like consistent gainers, this is for you. They basically never fail to meet earnings expectations, and essentially always outperforms competitors in RoE and cash flow.    ON Semiconductor Corp $ON  : Another consistent gainer that I almost never see in the red regardless of the rest of the market. Revenues that just keep improving, they keep making good acquisitions, some analysts are suggesting 20% or higher gains from these guys in 21-22. Reported earnings per share of 35 cents, just another great surprise form $ON. Options for this company are cheap right now as well, but rising fast. Institutional investors are flocking to this one too, so if you want to follow the smart money, $ON is a good bet.  There are a few more, but I can not mention them due to relatively low market caps. If you do not have much to invest, but want to get in on this sector, check out Magna Chip ($ M X) too.  All these companies have great growth potential and financials, have consistently gained, have excellent analyst scores, and are in a huge growth sector with massive demand and a supply that is so low governments worldwide are seriously looking into how to improve it.  The Biden administration is working on executive orders and funding/tax credits to help these companies pump out more and more product.  Think about some of the big growth industries right now. Well, they all depend on semiconductors. EVERYTHING has a computer in it, and they all need semiconductors, from your car, to your PlayStation, or the lighting/irrigation systems used to grow all that Canadian weed.  These are just my opinions, look into it yourselves before you spend any money. But these are not hyped stocks, so do not expect them to pump or dump, or make you a millionaire overnight. But they sure are green a lot.
It's just a WSB meme after all. I hope you like the meme.
Sentiment shift & theory.
Just a thought but I’m guessing as the GME price dropped we lost a lot of the new degenerates.  This is the lowest active number I’ve seen in the sub in a weeks, and futures just opened up so I would expect the old school degens to be here.  Anyone have reliable data points we could make a chart with and see if the price drop lines up with the shift in sentiment that from ‘diamond hands’ to ‘lol bagholders’?   Or is everyone watching the sports bowl? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Everyone posting their gains. This is my best week yet.
Who cares about this guy lmao
Lets get back to WSB   to the wall on CARR.    ’s over $45 or my wife will leave me for another autist.

Is AMC at the current price ($  a good deal?
Some of you are of the belief that AMC is post-pandemic value play. And that once the pent up demand for seeing movies in theaters is unleashed that AMC will be revitalized and soaring back to it's $30 share price from a few years ago. There is one big problem with that - AMC is already valued well above what it was leading up to the pandemic.   For AMC to reverse course, soaring back to it's 2017 highs - a $  billon market cap - that's really only about $  a share based on todays number of shares outstanding. 2017 had also seen operating revenue soar from $  billion to $  billion (growth that it came nowhere near sustaining). The following 2 years had $  billion in revenue along with increasing long term debt.      Silver Lake converting $600 million of notes into equity was certainly a fortunate turn of events for AMC.  While this may take bankruptcy off the table,  there are still   \- from $  billion to $  billion.   I at one point bought into the AMC hype and that it would be heading for the moon - and for a moment it did. The reality is that if you bought in under $4 you've already done very well - and perhaps far better than you should have expected.   Even AMC at $  values the company about where it was January 2, 2018. Pre-pandemic, pre-Silver Lake loan and almost $5 billion less in long-term debt.    Do you what you want.         \ sorry I'm bad at making graphs
The biggest gain I may ever have came from this single 300$ option I held overnight. 300$. ===>  in 12 hours. Thank you GME!!
GME FINRA short volume data
We  have a bunch of posts that base some theories off the FINRA short  volume data. This post is just a quick reminder that the FINRA data has  some conditions:  If you read through the 05/2019 Information Notice (  they state that the data:  "(1)  does not include any trades that are not publicly  disseminated, (2) is  not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does  not—and is not  intended to—equate to short interest position  information. "  In  general the short volume overstates the actual short position volume. A useful check are the  exchange short volume numbers from marketbeat for instance ( .  For example the total short sold volume as reported by the exchange (  - \  or even   just for NYSE -    Also, the Total Volume combined for all exchanges from FINRA for let's say the 22nd Jan (97Mil) is smaller than the one reported by the exchange \~195Mil which agrees with the Yahoo number.  For a Buy or Sell for  instance - there may be multiple trades behind the Buy that need to be  made to deliver or sell your shares - including maybe a short sale or  two. Now these shorts will be covered quickly, but they still show up in  the FINRA numbers - I think these complex trade chains are root of the  problem.  Like  always if I am wrong let me know and I can either take this down or  edit it appropriately. I just want us to be better informed.
AMC Entertainment Adopts Staggered Board Structure At Request Of Owner Wanda

WSB community plagued with hate! My experience.
I’ve been a part of WSB since pre 1m, before GME and AMC, back when we posted crazy returns and heart breaking losses. WSB used to be a fun place for people to share their trading experiences good/bad and interact with people who have gone through the same situations, and felt safe posting in a community that understands. Recently the community has gone through some changes with the large amount of new users joining. It’s weird cuz I made a post with outdated info about GME and they were all very quick to tell me I was a retard and how they hated seeing GME posts and whatnot. While I read these many hate comments by these professional investors who know everything, i think to myself “why do they even bother to comment on a GME post if they’re sick of GME?” The more I think about this the more confused I get and the more I realize I may actually be retarded. Thank you for coming to my click bait titled Ted talk.

Earnings this week with High Short Squeeze Potential (Week of 2/8)
Hello All,  Late on my dedicated time of 1pm EST, but here are the earnings this week with high short interest and days to cover. Just to clarify some of this, in order to make the list, they must meet both of these conditions: they must have a short interest above 5%, and ALSO must have a "Days to Cover" (DTC) greater than 3. DTC is calculated by taking the shares short divided by the average 10 day volume. While this isn't necessarily a proper indication, it does show the short amount relative to average trading volume. Without further delay, here is the list for this week:  Date Ticker % Short DTC  --  --  --  -- 2/8 CHGG     2/8 NUAN     2/8 SLQT     2/8 SPG     2/9 HBI     2/9 HAIN     2/9 AKAM     2/9 FOXA     2/9 WLTW     2/9 IIVI     2/9 CGC     2/9 AVYA     2/9 NCR     2/9 VOYA     2/9 GLUU     2/9 YELP     2/9 LYFT     2/9 RICK     2/10 ELY     2/10 NVST     2/10 HP     2/10 PACB     2/10 UA     2/10 HCSG     2/10 DBD     2/10 Z     2/10 WU     2/10 BE     2/10 ATUS     2/10 ZNGA     2/11 KPTI     2/11 TWOU     2/11 BWA     2/11 ALKS     2/11 TAP     2/11 INS     2/11 YETI     2/11 MAC     2/11 THS     2/11 CC     2/11 FROG     2/11 CARG     2/11 DDOG     2/12 IMGN     2/12 PRLB     2/12 AXL      Happy hunting, and enjoy the Super Bowl!   Edit: there seems to be some confusion, as expected when dealing with fellow crayon eaters. This is a list of companies with a higher potential for short squeeze this week due to 1) high short interest, 2) lower volume relative to amount of shares sold short, 3) a catalyst (earnings) this week that could bring in other retail and institutional investors. Yes, I know (insert stock) has 40%+ Short Interest and isn't on my list of "low short interest shit", great, they don't report earnings this week, they're not going to be on it.
Why RITE AID is (RAD) not BAD
Hello :-)  I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in. Posting this today so people can invest tomorrow if they want.  My timing is usually poor for posting my findings.    RITE AID (RAD)    Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20   reverse stock split   artificially X 20 the price.   WHAT DOES THIS MEAN   It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.  Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.   PROMISING NUMBERS      For those that can’t read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to   TWENTY FOUR   billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They’re looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.      WHAT DO I DO    I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.    I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It  should  be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.  And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.  20x   2/19 c is my immediate play  Edit: my position is   c I am as they say retarded
Some AMC “DD” for the average
I’ve seen a few people finally bring up AMC as something more than GME’s honorable mention. I’m just a casual trader who was holding 1k of AMC and some option contracts before this clown fiesta of a market trend showed up. I’ve done a fair amount of “DD” on AMC, but this is more conceptual potential based off news articles. Don’t expect math or grounded market concepts from this since that’s pretty far out of my trading style. Although, here are some key factors that have made me vary bullish on AMC before all this artificial price inflation.  Let talk about the AMC is a dying business concept. I don’t believe that in the slightest. I mean yes it’s much easier to stay and home and stream new movies, and yes a lot of big name producers have been dabbling with the straight to streaming release concept. Although, most of the titles being released straight to streaming have been smaller budget titles that weren’t expected to pull huge crowds in theater. With the exception of the new Wonder Woman and Pixar movies. That being said the budget for WW was 200 million and for Soul it was over 150 million. These budgets are common place for big block buster now a days. A fraction of $7-$12 subscription fee would likely have profits that would break even on budgets this large. Defiantly when you factor in costs of other movies and original content that is also in production. No movie producer is looking to break even on budget costs. They want huge profits margins which are mostly realized in box office sales.  This brings us to the life cycle stage of movies and how it maybe changing for the better going forward. The life cycle of a movie after production is typically:   Theaters, on demand/Blue-ray, streaming services, and lastly day time tv. Box office sales are typically where most of the profit is realized. On demand and blue-ray are worth mentioning, but the second biggest income is obviously stream services renting the rights to have them on their platforms. No matter how you look at this eliminating the box office releases is just throwing away millions in potential profits. It really doesn’t make sense to do that. Especially with this new game changing deal that was recently struck with Universal studios.   This basically says that the amount of time for a theatrical release will be weeks instead of months. This deal was actually a power play by AMC where they said they wouldn’t show anymore Universal Studios movies in their theaters if Universal started doing more straight to streaming releases. Obviously there was a compromise reached in the interest of both parties, but it goes to show that a big name like Universal Studios values the box office greatly. Also, this deal opens up so many door for even platforms like Netflix to release their more notable movies in theater first. Netflix has in the past considered theatrical releases but could never agree on the 90 day release timeframe.  Next, I should talk about how AMC’s stock price has fallen so low based off the fact that they were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Basically, AMC has been selling stock and taking loans to give itself just the smallest amount of runway to keep afloat for another month. Although, now talk of bankruptcy is in the rear view window. This is widely due to you delinquents blowing up their stock’s value.     Now they went from having a month or so of runway to enough to last them well into 2021. That’s not to mention a lot of movie deals that are reaching into as far as 2023.   I might be missing some recent news points, but these factors; along with the fact that vaccines most likely being available to the general public in a few months, gives me a lot of hope for AMC’s future. My DD is pretty bare minimum and fuck if I know if they are viable for a short squeeze? Even if they aren’t I’m sure they will get some attention in the hype if GME still has a chance. None of this is financial advice by the way. All in all I just like the stock.  TLDR,  1) Block buster movie budgets are $100’s of million and box office revenue is always just going to be extra millions of profit. 2) New movie deals will bring 90 day theatrical release windows to 17 days. Making theaters even becoming approachable for platforms like Netflix. 3) Threat of bankruptcy is pretty much gone. Plenty of runway funding for the future.      Still hold GME, AMC, and BB   . Since they told me in college diversification is smart, and I’m a high functioning autistic  .  See y’all on the        🌕

Coca-Cola - 🥤 - DD
# 🥤 Coca-Cola 🥤  $KO is one of those companies that were hit by the pandemic. As you may or may not know, their primary source of income is not the 15 bottles you swig every day, rather the franchise deals they make with restaurants, stadiums, $AMC, and so on, and in case you haven't noticed, these things have been shut down for a while, which means bad numbers.  However, with all the vaccinations going on, and Biden winning the presidency, soon Covid will be a thing of the past:               What this means is $KO will soon be swimming in money again. If you're quick you can get in before the smart money picks up on these obscure clues.  Now I'm not too good with numbers and stats (who needs it anyway, stonks go up), so instead, to show the potential $KO has let me direct you to the daily graph since 2020:     And the weekly graph since 2012:     Every time there's a big sell-off it's immediately followed by a buy-in, and since the sell-off just happened guess what's coming next?  What can I say? 🥤🥤🥤 Drink up those gains.     Positions - Currently sitting on 20x 3/19 55c options and I expect to add some more long-term ones once tomorrow opens up.
Thanks GME, now I'm going to go safely wheel some stuff.

We shall rise!
TO ALL THE PLAYERS!   GameStop won't just survive   Oh, you will see it thrive   The shorts won't kill the stock   As long we like the stonk  It is beyond the archetype   It won't just conform   No matter how hedge funds shake its core   'Cause our roots, they run deep, oh    Oh, ye of so little faith   Don't doubt it, don't doubt it   Victory is in our veins   I know it, we know it   The power is within the players   And we will not negotiate   I'll fight it, we'll fight it   GameStop will transform    When, when the fire's at $GME again   And when it's red, the vultures all start circling   They're whispering, "you're out of time, $GME is going down!"   "The trend is dead, don't be a clown!"  But still, it will rise   This is no mistake, no accident   When you think the final nail is in, think again   Don't be surprised, it will still rise    We must stay vigilant and conscious   Through the madness and chaos   So I call on my apes   They say  Oh, ye of so little faith   Don't doubt it, don't doubt it   Victory is in our veins  ❕ ❗️

Take a pause and think for a minute before downvoting non GME posts
We as a sub has always had crazy runs like current GME, BB. Before it was TSLA, AMD, weed stocks and we always had extremely bullish retards writing long ass DD to justify their rationale. We also had bearish bears writing theories like quadwitching where we collectively lost money. But even when at peak Tesla, we still had posts about small pee pee AAPL gains, and loss porn because of the Mouse 🐁  I also threw money like y'all in GME and didn't close while ahead. I'm going to diamond hand this because frankly I don't have an exit strategy and with options, I somewhat broke even for stocks i bought. Now we can keep crying about money lost or try to make new money. There are lot of plays going on. What happened to my PLTR gang? Why are y'all so silent? Weed stocks are going up again, yet we ain't paying attention. BYND been shooting again, crossing some important levels. TSLA back to 850+. We had some crazy ass earnings reports from big tech, again no discussion. And it's not like people aren't posting, there are some posts but they're not getting any traction because we're literally stuck in this GME loop.   So i ask all of you, new and old gang, to take a break and think what's the way out? We can circle jerk all day and cry about those hedge funds and the media and the manipulation like we've been doing for past two weeks. Or we can start looking for new plays and buy new consoles from GameStop. At least that's a better plan than just simply hoping to pump questionable DD posts to r/all and expecting momentum swing.   Positions: ASAN LEAPs, PLTR, PSTH, BABA and of course GME

Looking to invest in SexTech/Sexual Health ETF. Do any exist?
Hey Folks, induldge me for a second as I stray a little from the hottest topics of this sub. I’m very interested in the $30B sextech industry for many reasons (people getting back together this summer, women’s empowerment, etc.) and know that many companies that fall in this category never get looks from institutional investors and are pretty beholden to crowdfunding and VCs.  I’m just your humble ape-retail investor, so my fanciest source for finding opportunities are usually common sources (SA, Google, etc.).  None of my queries have turned-up a sextech ETF.  Do they not exist?  And if not, why not? It’s a massive industry and there’s lots of money there.
A little unsexy, but a reminder TO PAY YOUR DAMN TAXES! Also don't claim losses until you sell your shares.
In most countries you generally only pay the taxes on your earnings when you sell your shares. Probably all countries but I don't want to be definitive   Likewise, you can only claim losses on your shares when you sell them. You cannot claim a deduction for unrealised losses  Lastly, it is illegal to sell your shares to realise the losses so you can claim a tax deduction and immediately buy shares back (it's called a wash trade). Don't do this either.  I've seen some stupid comments around here about people using their entire earnings to pay their loans or others claiming tax deductions on losses for shares they still own  Check your countries individual tax laws before spending any money or making any deductions. Calculate your tax obligations before spending a cent. If you can't, either get an accountant to do it or just wait to find out how much you owe. If you thought the stress of holding was bad, wait until you get audited.

$OPEN - MASSIVE SETUP
This is my last post on OPEN. This opportunity is significant imo. Technically this is setting up very well.  We traded down last week on an equity raise that was oversubscribed and upsized.  Quiet period is likely ending (not sure if this happens with SPACs), so you could see initiation reports from the big sell-side banks over the coming weeks.  Fundamentals of the business are strong with   home prices + sales rising. Targeting $36-40 in the next two weeks and $60 after earnings.     Positions    Feb 19 - 28 calls  Feb 19 - 30 calls  Feb 19 - 35 calls  Mar 19 - 27 calls  Plan to role my febs into march on dips.     Source: Me and your dad. Not investment advice.

Intriguing Tesla volatility play I stumbled across .... March 2021 $20p
I had to read that thread a couple of times. Forget being a gay bear on TSLA. No one buying $20p expects it to go ITM  However, when GME was pumping, I bought some March $30p for $1 and when GME pumped to $480, I sold them for $   HOW CAN SHE SLAP!?! Because the IV on the option chain shot up to 1000%  I did some digging around and some big money boy bought a metric fuck ton of Feb & Mar $20p, check out the OI  So how do I make money off this shit?! TSLA currenttly has an IV of ~70%   Last month it was at ~85%  Dec IV was ~110%  If the volatility in TSLA picks up back to the 85% range, ToS is telling me these $20p should go from $.04 to around $.12  Say what you will, that is 200% increase  If IV goes back to 100% range and Tsla drops to around $750 sharply (like in one session) then these can be worth around $.50  Will I be able to sell them if they pump that high? Who the fuck knows. Someone bought 500k of these, so why not throw some cash at it  40 x TSLA $20p March @ .04
DD on the Commodity SuperCycle and How To Get The Most    Tendies With Oil Company Penny Options KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) & EPD (Enterprise Products Partners)
Hi fellow autists,  Your wife's boyfriends' (multiple I know you know) favorite contemporary art dealer is back with another DD on the commodity super cycle and the most     may be in sight with oil company penny options in KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners).  What is a commodity super cycle?      It's the rise of many physical commodity prices (such as those of food, oil, metals, chemicals, fuels, and the like) driven by various factors, but this COVID one is mostly by the stimulus spending and a weaker US dollar and the parabolic growth being observed in the East led by China where we see demand above 2020 levels.   This new "roaring 20s" will be accompanied by easy monetary and fiscal policy (more     ), a weak US dollar, and stronger inflation, all supportive for commodity prices. (Yes, I repeated what I said because it is important)  And why Oil? Besides the obvious reason of Saudi did an output cut and raised prices on the crude. I personally think another reason is because we have put so much emphasis on renewable energy like Solar and Hydrogen, but we ignored the basic scientific fact that in order for a total energy replacement and revolution to happen, it will take at least another 20-50 years! So oil will still be around and coexist alongside the solar the hydrogen and all kind of other good stuff fancy energy!      And oil companies have seen some rebound, but they are far from the pre COVID level, and if the commodity super cycle is happening (it is already happening, go check the oil companies tickers today) as explained by everyone's favorite market guru Marko Kolanovic from JPM, then I personally think we will very likely see oil companies going parabolic across the board as the major funds that have made huge profits from tech and renewable energy to cycle some of the profit into the oil which needed some tendie love and most importantly it is undervalued.  Out of all oil companies, I personally think KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) will benefit most fabulously from this energy cycle. Why? Because besides the fact that both KMI and EPD are oil industry first-team relatively large market cap players, their option prices are very reasonable for a good trade if the super cycle takes off with a rocket engine.   Let's let the data speak:  KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) is trading at $ , market cap $  KMI pre COVID crash high price was $  on 02/19/2020. KMI $20 call 03/19/21 is asking for only $ !   EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) is trading at $ , market cap $  EPD pre COVID crash high price was $  on 02/20/2020. EPD $26 call 03/19/21 is asking for only $ !   Kinder Morgan and Enterprise Products are what I find as large enough market cap, so they will not be too easy to dilute shares, and their OTM options for 03/19/21 and later dates are priced very, very well.  For me, these are the type of options trades to get        tendies, and this super cycle will have large funds coming in hoards and get on this oil sector rocket!  TLDR: Commodity SuperCycle is happening. Penny options from oil companies such as KMI (Kinder Morgan Inc) and EPD (Enterprise Products Partners) will take off.   Sources:                    Disclaimer:   I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor.

DD: Listen up retards the future is shroomstock🍄📈
Attention retards, the future is in psychedelic research companies  I’m in the field neuroscience and pharmaceutical industry(I’m a slave uni intern:( ). Listen up guys you’re probably wondering hmmm why should I keep and eye out in these stocks. Well the answer is big pharma is going to buy them out after they compete with their current products and win. The entire sector of anti psychotics, anti depressants ssris, mood suppressors, maois, anti anxiety medication, benzos, addiction medication, and Adhd medication are going to be taken out by these companies, and then bought into the big pharma borg.   The evidence is in the scientific studies, which show that these psychedelic and other illicit compound research companies have the most effective cutting edge mental illness treatment on the planet. Ketamine for example is the worlds most effective short term anti depressant. Magic mushrooms are shown to be the worlds most effective treatment at treating treatment resistant depression. Ibogaine is the worlds most effective anti addiction drug for heroin, with 77% of users in one study not relapsing when they didn’t return to their old enviornment. Lsd is shown to be incredibly promising to treat alcohol addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous started out using it actually. Mdma is considered the worlds most promising drug for treated PTSD AND CPTSD. DMT is being used in new trials to treat depression as well with much success.   The thing all these stocks have in common is that companies such as mindmed compass pathways Numinus wellness and others are all researching and gaining patents on these drugs and developing new analogues to patent and sell for insane profits. The future of healthcare is in these drugs. Oh and the growth in this sectors huge. The sector is on track to hit   billion dollars marketshare in 2027. This is the next boom. My Holdings are 5 shares CMPS 100 shares    TL/DR: Buy companies that do research on dmt ibogaine mdma ketamine lsd and mushrooms.
Warning: GME discussion
As a thought, because I have not seen anyone trying to approximate this number.   Could anyone have a crack at working out how many shares are being held by true diamond hands?  I’ll define diamond hands in this case as anyone who got burned/ other reason but will hold all their shares till they die or it hits $500 dollars again for eternity.  If in the millions? That is a lot of shares to sit off the market. Noh?

Enphase Energy (ENPH) pre-earnings (Feb 9) Extensive DD
EDIT: Posted a post-earnings DD in which I analyzed the earnings results and web-call. Post is under approval and is not online yet. Let's hope a Mod will approve it ASAP.    Hi all,  Since the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.  First of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.  I will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.    Okay here we go:    I have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.    Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.    What my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week’s earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.  While doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.    Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:          First observations:  \- 2020 amazing year.  \- Dip Q3 2019.  \- Good year 2018  \- Something was going on in 2017. But there was a change since 2018, 2019, 2020 are good years.  \- Bad year 2016, again something changed.  Please note the price implication in the last column. Visualized here:          Step 2: Company snapshot.          Observation: High P/E value compared to competitors. Large market cap, higher ROE.        \- Stock price stays above MA-Simple (50) line despite any dips (Positive)  \- Growth in P/E ratio (Negative)    Step 3, Seasonality analysis.          \- February has on average been a strong month. So buying now would on average be a good idea. This month it has increased 6% while the average for February is   (8 year average) (no statistically proven).    Step 4, Ownership.      Important question to ask: were there any strong buys/sells in the last couple months. The more recent the data, the better. We don’t look at holding reported at 09/30/2020.          Observations:  \- Strong buy by CEO Mr. Badrinarayanan on the 28th on Jan. 2021.  \- Strong sell by Sunpower Corp. (not representative)  \- Strong buy Blackrock Fund Advisors on 31th Dec. 2020.  \- Strong buy Blackrock Advisors (UK) on 31th Dec. 2020.    Step 5, Ratio analysis.

Ubiquiti – UI – Momentum stock with Potential Short Squeeze or Leveraged Buyout
Ubiquiti Inc. develops networking technology for service providers, enterprises, and consumers.  On 2/5/2021 Ubiquiti announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).  For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.  1. While the stock has a   market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about   of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you. 2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock    A Little Background    Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.  As of 12/31/2020 there were   shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns   shares or   of the company.  The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $  authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.  According to  , institutions own   shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.  Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.  The end result is a float of   shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.  The company just declared another $  dividend. With $  in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.    Now for the Shorts    As of 1/15/21 there were   shares short which represents   of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of   as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.  With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?  Pera has not shown a desire to   index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime   Company continues to repurchase shares.  I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.    Why not a leveraged Buy-out    Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.  The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.  With $  still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another   shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.  Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?    Conclusion    You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.  This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is   and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.  The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.    TL;DR   Ubiquiti $UI is a position to add to your portfolio based on it fundamentals, momentum and the possibility of a short squeeze that could be a moon shot based on the small float and ongoing share repurchase program.         I Love Ubiquiti’s products and this stock.  I have been long since 5/22/2014 and have added to my position as recently as 2/5/21  This Content is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment or financial advice.  Edit1: Clarification based on a comment. Leveraged Buyout may be the incorrect term for my thought process. I intended to imply that Pera could just take the company private as he owns a significant percentage of the outstanding shares and is reducing the percentage he does not own through the stock repurchase program.  Edit2: Added TL;DR above.  Rookie mistake.
The game is rigged but  ✊✊✊ can still win!
Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.  For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.  There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:    Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this "insane"? $5k? $50k?   GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.  People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.  I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.  Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out   my share  ???

Underestimating the Hedge funds - PART 2 (part 1 on profile)
Will AMC jump in price?
I’m new to this and only bought cause I had some money and I thought it was hilarious that Reddit attacked wall street.  I’m losing currently but it’s not that big a deal.  But I was wondering about AMC  AMC currently has a volume of 30 million, its average volume being over 500 million.  Does this mean everyone who owns AMC is holding or is nobody buying AMC anymore?  I don’t know much about stocks but with an extremely low volume compared to normal, if we got an influx of people to purchase AMC.  We could make the demand fly way over the current supply.  I could be wrong but this just seems right to me.  I’m holding no matter what but was just thinking about it.
The funniest aspect of GME...
Is all the "OG" WSB'ers crying about losing their safe space. like holy shit. Its almost as if you guys took pride in being reckless with your money, filled the comments section with immature bullshit about throwing your money at a crooked system on long odds because "This is my only chance." I wonder why the sub is now filled with "apes" who have black holes as hands? I wonderrrr who could beeeee to blame lmfao.
Markets set for bearish phase beginning Feb 9th as the planet Mars assumes complete control over the Dow Jones.
Markets set for bearish phase beginning Feb 9th as the planet Mars assumes complete control over the Dow Jones when it enters within 30 degrees of the lunar node  Here is proof
Here's which tickers were mentioned the most in discussion yesterday
Hedge Funds Are A Symptom - ADDRESS THE CAUSE
Hate Hedge Funds & Wall Street - Why Not End Them All?  With so many users on WSB, there are many point of views about Wall Street and the market.  However, it seems to me the majority of the community dislikes Hedge Funds and the big players who have t  over retail investors to make a living.    Considering the current economic environment, it's more imperative than ever to be "invested" in the stock market. The problem is the financial system and Wall Street ultimately benefits from the growing amount of investors.  Even when retail outperforms hedge funds or manages to achieve trades like $GME, it eventually works in their benefit.  The value of assets increasing allows higher returns, speculation, and the securitization of these assets(& rehypothecation) to use for financial gain.    The Financial system has changed ever since 71s departure of the Gold Standard(which had problems due to Bretton Woods) and 1977 amendment of the Federal Reserve Act.  Ever since then you can see interest rates have trended in down for 40 years now - this is because the Federal Reserve's mandate of "maximum employment" causes Fed to stop recessions with lowering interest rates which to incentivize debt/consumption.  Ever since the beginning of the 80s community banks have been annihilated due to monetary policy, its structure, and Congress.  Wealth inequality just so happens to start it's trend upwards, favoring the 1%(really  , and corporations shift board compensation from salary to stock/option compensation; corporations have also increased share buybacks and dividends as a % of profits too.  Again, this is caused by monetary policy and it rewarding speculation and short term invesments over long term(capex/wages).  This structure/policy is also why private equity went on a boom in the 90s and continued ever since.  If you examine corporate bankruptcies from private equity their % is more than double the average.    has a report titled Pirate equity or something along those lines and they tracked retail employment for from 2007-17 or a time frame close, and in 10 years the retail sector had added over 1 million jobs while retail owned by private equity had "suffered" almost 600k job losses!   The monetary system is how the financial sector and big banks control our economy.  They have more power than Congress and literally direct how capital flows and which sectors thrive or die.  The Federal Reserve is just an extension of Wall Street - the NYFED is a corporation with a board that is mostly bank CEOs or members of their board.  These people are responsible for bank supervision...    I saw a popular post on here about a guy holding his $GME position.. It was titled: "This is for you, Dad". They were holding their position just to inflict any pain and losses possible on hedge funds.  Their explanation for this was the housing crisis and how it caused his dad to lose his business and a lot more, all while these funds were bailed out and their livelihoods unaffected by a crisis they helped create.  Unfortunately, his reasoning doesn't address the real culprit that caused his father's and families pain.. Along with millions of Americans.    The Federal Reserve has created an economy for the Big Banks and their control - assets have literally only grown at big banks(mostly big four/six).  In fact, the Office of the comptroller of the currency quarterly report will show you FOUR banks control 155 TRILLION of the derivative market while ALL OTHER BANKS control 23 trillion.    The 800 billion bailout for banks has been mentioned as well... Try 16 trillion(Google GAO audit) or 29 trillion(Link below) if we include currency swaps(which were for other countries not the banks).  The Fed created emergency facilties to specifically bailout banks and AIG.  These emergency facilties were managed by... WALL STREET.  In fact, 8 out of 10 of the highest paid contracts to manage facilities with taxpayer money to bailout themselves were given "non-competitively" - usually gov contracts have to provide a fair auction so they can't favor companies over another.  The Fed can just say these are "unusual and exigent circumstances" to bypass that.  They paid Blackrock over 100 million to help manage these facilties.  I think PIMCO was over 100 million too.  Then BofA and other banks were paid tens of millions as well.  The banks literally were involved in bailing out themselves.  They received trillions in lending by the Fed - Citigroup had the highest total at   trillion.  They literally had their toxic debt offloaded onto the Feds balance sheet.  It took the Fed 10 years to unload all of their "Maiden Lane" MBS purchases.    Present day they bailed out banks in 2019 - before covid - with repo operations.   From    "If the Fed had wanted the public to clearly understand that its repo loans were ongoing but had simply gone dark, it could have printed a statement to that effect on the daily page it posted showing zeros going out in repo loans. After reading the F-SOC revelation, we searched the New York Fed’s website for hours to see if it had ever made a public statement that it was going dark on the dollar amounts of its repo loans. We finally found this statement dated June 11, 2020:  “Beginning with this month’s release, the Desk will no longer publish daily updates with the next business day’s operational details.”   The Fed's cumulative loans from Sep 2019 to mid March 2020 totaled over 9 trillion.  Half way into 2020 they stopped publishing.  However, as WSOP points out from the F-SOC the big banks are currently using   trillion of loans.  These are typically overnight or a few days.   None of this is transparent because the NYFED is a corporation and is not subjected to FOIA - The board of Fed is but I tried getting records on the emergency facilties and they stated they do not have these records because the NYFED conducts the lending and facilties.  So, the trillions of bailouts in 2008-10 and in 2019 and 2020 are literally at a corporation and not the agency(Board) of government.       Alright, I could go on for another 100 pages quite literally.. Let's get to the point.    The only way to beat this system is to stop using it - practically impossible.  The only way to achieve that is to stop using Dollars... Also practically impossible.  However, a huge impact to the system would be to not hold any savings or any large holdings of dollars the banks.  It's imperative.  Investing in anything outside of dollars, debt in dollars, and any investments is necessary - holding savings in metals is one and there are many others(dig c) could actually inflict major problems IF many people actually committed to this.  If a few percent of Americans did this the banks would have huge problems.    Nothing is going to change until we address the Federal Reserve.  Anything less is just a  game that won't  stop the pillaging of avg Americans from this industry.

Ape Thoughts
Unless you've sold your stocks for cash - went liquid and paid the taxes. You haven't gained or lost   its cool to show you "gained $10k when the stock went up and that you lost $10k when it went down. BUT your investment is still $  until you sell your shares for cash, you didn't lose or gain anything. My ape minded opinion.   Still holding GME cause there's still action and staying green in the other micro investments.  Also, favorite app/platform for trading stocks not on the normal Apps? Looking for a few canadian companies that aren't "supported yet"...
Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC
I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.  Their reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.  To preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout "market manipulation" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).  The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:  My screenshot (02/05/2021):        Current report (02/08/2021):        The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image -   the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.  Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on "updating data".  I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.  However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.  Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.  My screenshot (02/06/2021):        Current report (02/08/2021):        As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).  In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.  I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?  There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.        Here's the email he received.        Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.  Thoughts.    I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.    I'm still holding strong!  Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:  "Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn’t up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.  Are you certain the chart isn’t updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I’ll resolve your ticket but I’m still here if you reply."  I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say "oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more "accurate" measurements to our users". Ya know?    Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at   from the previous   Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.      Edit X2:   A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.  His post (  also points out that   Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.    And for all of you   asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.      \ \ \ UPDATE\ \ \     This beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post        This is their response:        So their excuse is a "programming error". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).  I'm just sayin' feels like excuses to me.

(2/8) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News
#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday-         #           > # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November  >   Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday’s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average’s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow’s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and   businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday’s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer’s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday’s premarket trading.         > # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year  >   The   economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden’s $  trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $  trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.         > # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week  >   Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump’s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the   Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as “very unlikely.” Trump’s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.         > # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine  >   South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca’s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the  , AstraZeneca’s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee.         #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(            #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(            #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(            #LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS: ######(            #TODAY'S S&P SECTORS: ######(            #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(            #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(            #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(            #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(            #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(            #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(            #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(            #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(    ######(    ######(             #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(            #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(            #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(  source:           >   Hasbro (HAS)   – Hasbro reported quarterly profit of $  per share, 13 cents a share above estimates.

Weekly Stock Market News    GOOG / AMZN / PINS / SQ / PYPL / COST & other Stock Market News [02-08]
The stock market finished a terrific week at record highs    Companies like Google, Pinterest, Amazon & others smash earnings reports while Jeff Bezos bows out    Let’s talk about this & other stock market news    Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the week with big gains with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite finishing at new record highs while the Dow Jones did also rise for 5 straight sessions. For the week the   outperformed gaining just over 6% in what was the best week since early November      The Volatility   dropped every day last week as it now seats just above 20, with this being a huge level that hasn’t been broken in a long while.  We saw all 11   finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6%      their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.  We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the   Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.  Also, the   Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.  In terms of Job numbers, we saw   dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under   last week.  This   season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.  In some other stock market   removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square    We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon   we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world    Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there,   showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions    The other big earnings report we saw last week was from  , which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run    Other companies also smashed earnings with  , which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $  despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the company    Meanwhile, though they didn’t have an earnings report,   reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by   crushed the analyst expectations of just   I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in January   And finally, let’s hope for a good day as the   for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

Discussion: Logically, GME short interest in the FINRA report should disappoint
Disclaimer: I am not an experienced trader and this is not financial advice. I'm looking for a (serious) discussion and you're more than welcome to prove my logic wrong.    The much anticipated FINRA report is published tomorrow after market closes. We're still in the dark about actual numbers for short positions, and we don't know much about what the hedge funds are up to. However, the way I see it based on what we've witnessed so far, their main strategy is one  of these two:  Case 1 - heavy manipulation of the data and the stock itself. If they chose to employ this strategy, they've most likely deemed the potential cost of fines/lawsuits more manageable than the losses from an uncontrolled short squeeze. If this is the case the numbers we've been given are manipulated or straight up false and the majority of shorts have not been covered. Their survival relies on retail investors selling due to FUD. All of this falls apart if FINRA reports a high short interest  tomorrow. Their only reasonable option in this case is to keep lying; the FINRA report will show a low short interest.  Case 2 - they're already covering their shorts one way or another. If this is the case the hedge funds have been more honest than most of us give them credit for. The estimates for the short interest have had a strong trend downwards, and if the estimates are accurate the squeeze has probably been squoze. It went down from more than 100% to 50% in a matter of days and I wouldn't doubt that it'll be even lower when the report comes. In other words, even in this case the FINRA report will show a low short interest.  Even if reality is some mix between both cases, there is in my mind no way they'll report a high short interest tomorrow. Otherwise everyone will jump back in and we'll at least get a repeat of what happened 2 weeks ago (peaking at \~490). Essentially, if the FINRA report comes with low short interest all paper hands will have sell orders ready for when market opens. The hedge funds will certainly make use of that opportunity.  TLDR: FINRA report bad, stock collapses (possibly momentarily) on Wednesday.
Some gains to brighten up our day (still holding BANG)

The Path to the Moon
The Path to the Moon   is beset on either side by Jackals.   Where once I was fooled, I thought the   Jackals   were only on one side, I now see many who have left the path to join with the other Jackals. Stray from the narrow path to the moon and   get eaten  . The Jackals are always hungry and don't understand why, they will say anything for a meal, anything for you to come and join them,   in their misery  .   The   Path to the Moon   has many twists and turns, Ups and Downs, it is important to remember this is an   energy flow at work  . As energy travels from A to B it passes through many positions and it is wise for you as any fish, to hold your desire,   hold your truth   and yours alone. Do not be fooled by the desires of the Jackals they do not know you, they do not have your interests at heart.   See your End     clear when you have reached it  , their is no one else in this game but you.   In truth it could actually be so much   easier, if we were one  . If there were no jackals. But this is the path we find ourselves on and a   hard truth   we must accept. I made a   little money   on my rocket to the moon but what I really gained from all of you I met on the path was   much wisdom  . I see that this little movement you guys made that could easily reshape the world, has quickly been turned by jackals into a   dark unfriendly path  . Much like the others before it.     Holding   onto that which   no longer serves you   does you no good. The jackals convinced you the bag was full, now you look and see that it is empty. Pesky jackals. If my right hand should bind me I would   cut it off   and be free and seek fresh opportunities, perhaps one day the flow might come around again, perhaps not.      I see you Jackals, I am listening, I am watching but I will not join you. Find another meal.
$PCG (PG&E) - California Utilities DD
Position  : I purchased $PCG shares at $  and added to my position last week.  Also purchased $SRE and $EIX.     Summary  :  California utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys – I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.  PGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $  B settlement  PGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.  Wild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).    1)   CA Utilities Undervalued      The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever.   2)   Bankruptcy Settlement      $PCG’s market cap is $  and has an outstanding bankruptcy $  B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $  billion and partial $  obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.    $PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER—see item #1. This wouldn’t work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $  in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $  So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.    This is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game.   3)   Dividend and Leadership      $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $  in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022—not much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak)   Another settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it’s not like they’re replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer’s Energy which was known for safety. She’s also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock—I expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers).   4)   Wildfires      Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn’t resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings—great entry point.    Potential     obstacles    There are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won’t be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.  Operation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There’s always the potential for additional fines, but they’d be pretty inconsequential.  Biggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E—like hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there’s that.    MOAT –       Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there’s no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.    WHY WSB?    Get that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you’re in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay.    EDIT:   Thanks for all the comments/feedback.      RE: $PCG hatred.     Hatred 100% valid—it’s not going away.  They’re pretty shitty.  My point is that the system has rewarded their ineptitude by forcing public investment into their business.  Those checks have already been signed and sent out.   It’d be like if you were the only Uber driver in town.  You drive the car, charge your passengers, and then you get in a huge wreck because you thought brake pads didn’t need to be inspected/changed.  Instead of being out of a car and in jail, the state tells your passengers to pay for your repairs and give you a 10% bonus for calling the repair shop.  Does it pay to have a well-maintained car in this situation?  No! The best position to be in in this situation is to have a super shitty car that requires 15+years of repairs collecting 10% every year until the brake pads need to be replaced again and the cycle continues.  It’s a monopoly.    RE WSB u/ DD   u/angela_lansbury busted me.  I’ve only been a user for 13 days!  Well, me and 80% of the users.  That said, as long as I finally have a forum—I have to express my gratitude to WSB.  I had no idea a community like this existed until $GME press.  I can’t tell you how much joy this group has given me and how much I’ve learned.  It also got me out of bed at 6:00 every morning for the past 2 weeks. My DD was tribute to this group.  I think there’s a good opportunity to get in to a very institutional position (utilities) for a discount.  Utilities are rigged—everyone knows that.  But what is a rather recent discovery is that their shittiness is directly proportional to forced public investment.  The worse you do the more you get.  This model works pretty well for schools, roads, etc.  The difference is that guaranteed $10 for every $100 spent that goes right into the utility’s coffers. This isn’t a back-the-truck up YOLO for me, it’s an investment I believe in.  I’m long on $PCG, but I also think there’s going to be upward pressure soon and wanted to share it with the group.    Edit 2   Just realized my comment responses were getting blocked.    Re: Erin Brokovich    In 1995 the stock was at $ , then cratered to $20 with the $333m settlement in 1996, and then was $35/share in 1998  Another example: The 2010 pipeline explosion affected share price. Pre explosion $48/ share.  Dropped briefly to $43, then back up to $48/ share three months later.    Re: new utilities for counties.   CCAs are not utilities.  They still need to use and pay to use PGE equipment (poles, wires).  CCAs contract generation.    Re: $   .  Users properly ridiculed you. The stock is in fact > 52 weeks old    Re: my prediction EOY  .  Tricky with fire season, but 1q earnings 2022 guess would be $20.  Don't know why it isn't $18 today.  Another point to mention is that SRE earnings come out 1 week prior to PCG and should set recovery pace.
The Su Cycle of (bae) AMD: WARNING TSUNAMI tendie alert!
This is my first DD, so I hope the mods don't violate! This is   strictly   for the   culture   and if you have issues do your   own     research  ! I'm typing this shit on my laptop and I'm tired so if CNBC interns are working overtime you better not run and tell your bosses shit. Take some notes, buy this stock, and you'll be blessing all your children with custom pcs and your childrens childrens. So let's do this shit!  1. and only 1.. This goes without saying its the   LEGENDARY      DR. LISA SU   aka   SU BAE!    you don't know who she is, do your own freaking research, i'm not holding your hand to the queen what is this some Bridgerton shit. Besides, i'm happy keeping her all to myself                                   Let's look at some stats, i know the ADHD kicking in probably    Market Cap:     B                         PE Ratio:                             Avg Vol:   42M   Vol Fri:   30M (rising trend after GME/AMC slowdown)  i'm not doing graphs and colors, sorry depending on how this goes next DD will get crayola  Ok enough of that,   TIME FOR PICTURES     ;#x200B;         ;#x200B;     And they're right! IT is the best ever, they have their products scaled to cover all the segments they're striving for. They've always been competitors to NVDA, Intel, Micron, and I'll even throw in Marvell another company I love. However, similar to GME's hold on the gaming shopping experience and console dominance, AMD has that same strength and capability being that they are powering the PS4 and Xbox, but more importantly the   PS4  !! I don't need to explain how the gaming industry has boomed, if ape need more look at   PENN   chart! Add in the fact, their highly highly profitable and beloved Radeon and Ryzen combo, like... I want to build a computer, don't know how to do it.... But if an autist like me can identify chips by the name Radeon and Ryzen and not ask if its a   Pokemon  , we str8! Even if you don't know what these chips are or do! Trust me, they generate tendies like your cam model crushes!                              ;#x200B;      ;#x200B;                      ;#x200B;      ;#x200B;  Fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year I  believe NVDA earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. However, its going to be a slow rally till then. I encourage WSB to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their AMD DD after it jumped 10% !     Home stretch:  Link to    There's been plenty of promotion and a majority came from people who pioneered the strong products and technology they have now. As well as members on their team that have propelled them to the gaming and computing chip force they are, as well as the data center leadership. A great leader knows when to reward their members to boost team morale.                                                               Link to    Nasdaq reported last week AMD had a "particularly high volume" of AMD 90 Calls expiring 01/29 this was definitely picked up on as a lot of people tried to play AMD earnings smart but got burned! But true autist know, the best time to buy in is after a loss                                                               I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation.   THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET  . Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an   options   play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. It would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in VALHALLA  A few   2/12 85C    A whole lot of   3/19                                                                                                                                                                                        Edit 1: it’s the motherloving PS5!! I appreciate the love, wisdom, and criticism - my first awards received too all I can say is “ MOMMMA!” -  takeoff voice      Edit 2: at work right now, but with all the stocks making noise and AMD regaining meme strength I’m hyped all I ever wanted for my first DD is to put people on before the breakout!  Edit 3: 2/9/21 I noticed that I didn’t clarify that 85C &   are my positions- the slow trickle phase has passed and thrusters are on ! Be excited but also be cautious CNBC is always watching 👀 do what you can afford
the sub is fine, it's just going back to normal
the subreddit became a hype machine for a while.  cause there like 6mil+ new smooth-brains like me with zero experience with the stock market & just "investing" based on hype   from what I understand  the sub was  about making dumb bets off ridiculous dd posts and losing money it was never about a movement to take down HF's, orpumping dead stocks  DFV did the work & followed the stock for like 2 years & his bet paid off. the stock went from 8$ to frinking 450$, it might have been stopped from it hitting 800-1000$, due to the shit fuckery,  but it's done. that was the squeeze. if you missed the peak just stop, it's not gonna happen again.  going from 4$ to 450$ is insane, even the VW one you guys keep bringing up was just a 100% gain.  you should move on,   wsb is not a get-rich-quick scheme, do your own dd, and if you find a stock with a potential share here and get us all to invest &  post our loss porn after the stock fails.
AMC Major Stakeholder Wanda Converts Stock To Allow For Sale
A major Chinese investor in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) converted its shares in the cinema operator in order to be able to sell them, according to a filing with the   Securities and Exchange Commission.  What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.  No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.  The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $  billion in May 2012.  Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.  The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.  The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.  The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.  See Also: Dave Portnoy Stakes $700K On AMC Again After Exiting All 'Meme Stocks'  In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.  Price Action: AMC shares closed nearly   lower at $  on Friday and gained almost   in the after-hours session.

Suspicious accounts on both sides of the gme debate
Both posts saying hold gme and sell gme are posted by accounts who have large gaps in posting history, large gaps in commenting history etc.  Theres one on the front page complaining how this isnt what wallstrettbets was about and has only posted here in the last 2 weeks. How the fuck does that person know what wallstreetbets was like before 2 weeks ago (I dont know what it was 2 weeks ago)  Just because they're saying shit you want to hear doesnt mean they're telling the truth or have alternative reasons for posting.  For all we know telling us retards to keep buying at these higher prices is because they're going to make it tank further and buy it back from you for cheap.  I'm holding gme having bought it at the peak each time, pinnacle retard here.
Traded my     for 💰 No Ragrets
To Ape Gang: Why Sentiment Has Turned Against You
I want you to understand this.  Truly.  I like GameStop.  I like $GME.  I believe in the long term plan (or what I/we think is the plan, anyway).  I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded.  I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March.  I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY.  I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company.  I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case, which they barely even pretend to have considered.  I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck.  My personal belief, which I require nobody else to share, is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do, and their buying alone will drive the price up.  But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price, or they'd have done so.  I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value.  And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares.  That's what I believe, and why I'm not holding positions right now.  I probably will in the future, but my personal opinion is the time is not right.  I wrote these posts:        (EDIT: lol I just realized both of those posts aren't visible since they were removed by the mods.      They were pro-retail and pro-GME)  I want to see people make money on this.  Better yet, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MONEY ON THIS.  Further, what Robinhood did, as well as Webull, Interactive Brokers, E\ Trade, EToro, and tons of other brokerages did,    was fucked up.  Everybody here agrees.     But you guys are actually fucking insane.  We dont have a problem with the stock.  We have a problem with YOU.  Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing.  And that's okay!  But the new people (7 million new versus   million old) have done the following:    Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME, AMC, BB, and NOK      Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK      Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots         While you've realized there were bots that were bought, you missed (probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas) that the bots were spamming NOK.      Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next   Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier.      I saw one person disagreeing with a long-time and well-respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post, and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position.   Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist      Short ladders?  Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder?  EVERY TIME?      You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply & demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days?   With zero understanding of market mechanics, explaining to others why price action is fake      "Look how low volume is on this candle!  It's not a real drop!"          Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 "paperhand pussies" for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1,500%   Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum   Denying Reality      S3 partners is not lying to you.  They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult-to-obtain information on short interest.  Just because they're reporting that short % of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you.   Spammed low-effort memes and easily-Googleable questions on the new submissions      When your posts were taken down, you posted AGAIN   Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot   AGGRESSIVELY spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position   I want to gag every time I see somebody write "I'm not a financial advisor" following a post that makes that very clear   Moving the goalposts      "YOU ARE HERE on the VW short squeeze graph!"      "We finished above $325!  Gamma squeeze!" (Personal confession, I almost fell for this one and I'm glad I sold before the plummet).      "Ok so there was no gamma squeeze Monday but Tuesday is the day!"      "Ok we fell another 50% Tuesday but definitely Wednesday!"      "Fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us!"   Accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done, which is remove shit-tier posts from the front page      which you then posted again         and again   Completely ignored the rules of our subreddit      Market Manipulation --      No Pump & Dumps -- pressuring other people to buy low float stocks (such as GME) so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam.      Political Bullshit -- If you think "it's not about the money" then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money.      No Bullshitting -- There are so many of you advising others on their trades (followed by "This is not financial advice, am ape") while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on Reddit 5 minutes ago, which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who DID know what they were talking about, but OP misinterpreted the meaning.         Believe it or not, that's against the rules.  Just say you dont know.  Or say nothing.  There's actually no need to spam.   Gain & Loss Posts - nobody wants to see your Loss on one-third of a share of AMC.  Come on.   YOLO - Your investment in one-third of a share of AMC is not a YOLO.  A YOLO is DFV leveraging up his entire $55,000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die.          Drowned out a lot of really good content on non-GME stuff      u/dhsmatt2 's        u/socialist_baby 's        I can't even find the others that I had in mind using the search tool because the entire list of YOLO's and DD's is filled with GME and AMC karma farming.   And you've now begun brigading WSB from r/GME.  You have formed a cult.  You've now decided, amongst yourselves, that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill.  Do you think that's a healthy mindset?  If this is the investment that you truly want to make, and you feel you have an understanding of the risks, then fucking    let it rip.     I hope it works out.  Seriously, I want you to make money.  I like Gain porn a lot more than Loss porn.  But stop bullshitting.  Stop brigading.  Stop spamming.  You're driving us nuts.
Geopolitics and semiconductors : Taiwan is leveraging TSMC/Qualcomm to force US confrontation on independence issue
So you’ve probably heard the news of Taiwan being “thanked” by America for alleviating chip supplies. But there’s some geopolitics behind this.   There’s talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo.   This is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.  How?   By forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines.   The reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it’s “now or never” before China reaches peer state status.  TLDR:  - Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.  - Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.  - DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue    What to do:  I honestly don’t really know. I’m hoping other ppl here can say how money can be made off this lol. I’d expect maybe AMD/Intel to go up.
Is the 9th really going to be the breakthrough event we’re all hoping for?
Sorry if there’s a better place to ask this, am a retard.   But I’m wondering,   and then apparently rapidly dropped by the 1st, and the data dropping on the 9th only tells us the short interest rate up to the 29th, is it really gonna tell us anything significant? I would imagine the HFs would’ve been smart enough to account for that in the first place anyway.
$TSLA $4TR/yr TAM. $800b total value is gonna double. PT $1,000
Maybe rare with all $GME posts which is support fully but I also like hearing about other positions. I think Tesla (and daddy musk) has a long runway ahead especially if they’re going to grow productions 50% compounding YoY in auto sales which means that by Apple makes their first car in 2025, Tesla will be producing $2.5million electric vehicles. Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to   from Ford, gm, etc.  Tesla’s auto business: has a lot of potential and there’s a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale.   Tesla insurance: they’re hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they’ll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road. Imagine an insurance company that can gather all camera feeds from the cars to evaluate accidents/damage claims and pass savings down to the customer. Win win. Huge potential.  Tesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over   million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner - FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it’ll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue.   Tesla Semi: this is one I’m super interested in. Walmart and other logistics businesses already bought thousands on back order. Compared to a 18 wheeler, a semi is 35% more efficient (and faster) meaning 35% or more reduction in transportation cost expanding margins for businesses. No brainer.   $TSLA TO THE MOON.

Violent demand incoming for uranium - why Cameco CCJ
Over the last 10 years, uranium prices have fallen like a rock. They look like your portfolio before you discovered WSB. Like anything that needs to be extracted from the ground (oil 🛢, gold 🏆, etc), falling prices often mean permanent production shutdowns. But it’s time for that to turn around.  :   Going into 2020, global nuclear utilities were expected to require roughly 182 million pounds of uranium concentrate to run reactors for the year, while expected global mine production was seen at 142 million pounds, he says. The pandemic has affected 50% of global uranium mine supply, or over six million pounds a month, so even a three-month loss would push production down to just over 120 million pounds this year, he says.   Uranium isn’t like oil, you can’t buy significant amounts on the open market - reactor operators often have significant supply contracted out for decades. We’re at the point in the uranium cycle where reactor operators are beginning to open new contracts for supply into the next decade. And the best part is that price runs on uranium can be extremely violent, see   from the last time uranium went to the 🌕 from 2003-2007. Prices spiked from $25/lb to a peak of $140/lb. Excerpt from $CCJ filings:   Uranium rallied 30% from March lows. Price upswings are normally violent and self-reinforcing because: "History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production."   So much production was shut down in 2020 due to COVID that many producers have had to buy uranium on the spot market. As demand continues to outstrip supply, we might see a uranium bull cycle even crazier than that of the 2007 bull run.  What are the best tickers to express a long uranium bet? If you’re subscribed to  , you could buy $URNM like a fucking loser. But why would we do that? I've lost money on $JNUG, I know not to play with small junior miners.  Call me a boomer but I prefer big established companies like   Cameco (ticker $CCJ)  . It’s been around for decades, and has lasted through multiple downturns. It has a market cap of $5B and even pays out a small dividend! We’re not fucking dividend investors though. My point is that Cameco is responsible for nearly 10% of global uranium production so   it’s not going anywhere  . Contracts to receive uranium with them are comprised of 40% fixed price and 60% spot - meaning that if prices of uranium on the open market moon      , you’ll see the same for their revenues.  Since no one knows when the SQUEEZE is going to happen, I suggest you buy shares or LEAP calls. Don’t gamble what you’re not willing to lose. That’s why I recommend somewhat OTM LEAP calls because of the long-term nature of this play.    TL;DR POSITIONS    $CCJ shares and Jan ‘23 15C, 20C, 25C      Don't put all your money in at one time, average in as $CCJ moves around and drops.
Yes Laddering is real, "Short Ladder Attack" is just editorializing the Laddering of Naked Shorts
I've seen a lot of back and forth among those who want to hand-wave away price manipulation because the term "Short Ladder Attack" is something Google doesn't return much about.       "Ladder"   is a term for an investment technique that requires investors to purchase multiple financial products with different maturity dates.      Legal Laddering ex:   >   Bond Laddering    can also be used as an overall retirement planning approach for all retirement investments. The idea is to separate CDs, cash, bonds, annuities, and others into different "ladders" (or "buckets" or "baskets") depending on when the asset is expected to be liquidated to fund the retirement revenue stream. Low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). Higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement.   >   >This strategy is useful for a diversified portfolio, with other assets in the stock market etc. Generally an initial investment of $10,000-$20,000 is required in order to purchase 5-10 bonds with different maturities for a specific timeline.           >   Short Put Laddering or Bull Put Laddering    is a unlimited profit, limited risk strategy in options trading that is employed when the options trader thinks that the underlying security will experience significant volatility in the near term. To setup the short put ladder, the options trader sells an in-the-money put, buys an at-the-money put and buys another lower strike out-of-the-money put of the same underlying security and expiration date.            Illegal Laddering ex:   >   IPO Laddering    also describes a process where, in order to purchase shares at a given price, investors must also agree to purchase additional shares at a higher price. This artificially inflates the price of the stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower price, with a guarantee that they will be able to sell at a higher price.   This practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the SEC after the stock market collapse  .     \            --  OK that was fun. We know a little more about a common term in investment strategy in "Laddering". We know that IPO Laddering was deemed illegal and reported on at length; where a party is able to artificially set the price of a stock by forming an agreement with another party that underwrites the retail price.  Now in the more in-depth version of the "Short Ladder Attack" article written \~6 years ago that's lately been passed around, the author describes at length how "Naked Shorts" can be combined with "Laddering" strategy to artificially set the price of a stock via shares not actually owned by either party. This is effectively what the blogger coined as the "Short Ladder Attack" strategy.  \              >   Naked Short    — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation—the lynchpin of this massive fraud.   >   >   The Anatomy of a Short Attack    — Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.   >   >The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill–gotten gain. (Click here for more on  .   >   >When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.     \              tl;dr - focusing on the terminology for "short ladder attack" is pedantic; what's being described is the combination of a Laddering price manipulation tactic combined with Naked Shorts. Both of those things are things.  I'm pretty retarded so I can't personally really imagine one being able to actually form a real case given data available to the public, or even those with terminal access. You'd need a real investigation with the power to subpoena data from the source.  Yes, the concepts described in the "Short Ladder Attack" article are real things. You can call it a number of things, but it's effectively a similar tactic to all "laddering" via shares neither party actually owns.  No, that doesn't mean that's definitely what happened w/ GME.  And No, you don't need a smoking gun to ask the SEC to investigate it.
Save $AMC Billboard in Kzoo goes viral
KALAMAZOO, Mich. (WOOD) — A Kalamazoo man has paid for digital billboards referencing the Reddit group WallStreetBets and the short squeeze of hedge funds that have been occurring with stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.  Photos of the Save AMC billboard at the Wings Event Center are going viral on social media.  Brett Reath, the man behind the billboards, says he is poking fun at Wall Street and wants to bring attention to what hedge funds have been doing for decades by shorting stocks.  The messages will appear for a few days during the morning commute and evening rush hour.  “I thought it was a really interesting way to kind of shed light on the situation that’s been going on,” Reath said.  Reath says purchasing the advertising was not expensive, he paid $100 a day for two billboards to run in the rotation at set times.

PDC Newsletter: Trading Week Ending 2/12
Dear Member,  Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on February 12th? We hope that this email finds you well and not dead from the Meme Stonk War of 2021.  Compared to the last few weeks, we have a relatively boring week coming up. Our primary goal is to move our assets into areas that will produce steady gains. I have two focuses with this.  1. Use the current situation to optimize gains through high risk and volatile stocks that could shoot us in the foot. 2. Acquire holdings that will let us cash in on the technological transition over the coming years 3. I know, it was intended to be two, but let's be real. We are definitely going to hold out buying power for options on the Disney earnings report!  My first thoughts here are that our situation doesn't allow for high quality options trading given that there are huge transitions occurring within the retail investor. We have a horde of idiots moving on from GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. They have no idea what to do other than go back on the Palantir train. With these things in mind, we're going to make a couple safer plays this week and minimize new options.  Worth noting, but not detailed this week is a movement of long holding funds into ARK related ETFs (including PRNT). After reading through ARK's Big Idea's 2021, I truly believe their ETFs are going to obliterate the S&P over the coming 6-12 months. This is heavily dependent upon how much innovation occurs and is facilitated by the government. If the current trend continues, they're going to average well over 20% this year due to the needs of companies moving into new sectors of technology. I don't know which will be the most notable; so, I've chosen to hold all of their assets.       DIS (The Mouse)      It's time to bet the house on The Mouse. With earnings coming up after hours Thursday 2/11, they're going to continue their pop they've been showing over the previous week. It's VERY tough to tell where they're going to end the week, but this is a prime opportunity to do some quality percentage gains on OTM calls. If you're looking at high premiums, make sure you're careful to play the higher traffic options so that you don't get burned. I'll personally recommend steering clear of the $200 number unless you're willing to risk it all. Disney clearing the $200 mark this week would be massive. The lower premium makes it enticing, but it won't happen unless their subscriber numbers are through the roof. For me, I'm shooting for $190 in hopes of getting a quality OTM to ITM transition and then dumping it at open on Friday.       CVS (You know you want to do it...)      WIth earnings coming up 2/16, they're expected to crush the estimated earnings. The problem here is of course: "are the earnings already priced in?" You know what? Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. CVS fluctuated over $  in price over the last week alone ($  - $  I'm going to dig deep and hit the $75C for 2/19 in hopes of a solid outcome on earnings. Will this happen? I'm going to say yes, BUT I wouldn't expect it to hold. Both Walgreens and CVS stock have been more volatile than usual given the hopes they receive approval as vaccine distribution locations. I'm going to hold the calls in hopes of a solid pop and then dump them all when there are high hopes of a solid close on 2/19.       MARA + RIOT      I'm going to double down on these two because of the general adaptation occurring throughout large corporations. There is no reason to think this will die off. The limited supply of Voldemort and "the halvening" that occurred in the last year will also contribute to a continued rise in Voldemort demand.      According to ARK, if companies move ONLY 1% of their free cash into Voldemort, it will rise by $40,000. Now this is a long stretch, but if they moved to 10% of free cash into Voldemort, it would jump by $400,000. This seems unrealistic right now, but 1% is absolutely possible. Multiple companies including Square have already adopted this concept with great success.      MARA is successfully moving up this week towards new ATHs. Voldemort will likely continue to rise over the coming year. The play here is obviously not short term returns. The play is holding a company that will be worth 2-3x in the coming years.      RIOT is now right back on track with its three month moving average. The volatility here is inevitable given the movements in Voldemort and associated Voldemort infrastructure.       CCIV      CCIV crushed last week and I'm going to double down on this too because Lucid and CCIV refuse to acknowledge or deny the rumors of their merger/acquisition. If I were a gambling man (I am), I would hold a small stake of CCIV shares as I hold deep OTM calls with a heavy Theta. At a $50 strike, you will pay 10% extra for the 8/20 calls over the May calls. May could be a tight race to guarantee the acquisition is occurring. August gives us a strong theta and will allow it to grow.  Sincerely,  Lehman Brothers' Risk Management Department    Mouse is in the house.
"Rocket Fuel for AIs"
I know MF is not a good advice, but their latest "subscribe now" phishing email got me curious, mostly because I'm interested in AI, and I wouldn't mind making some money off our future overlords.   So I'm curious if anyone has any further information on this, what compan(ies) this may be referring to etc, a lot of googling has gotten me nowhere without a paywall.    Their latest email says:   "The CEO of ARK Investments takes Bezos further: "We think \[it\] could approach $17 trillion in market cap -   which would be 35 Amazons.  "  WHAT in the world could be worth 35 Amazons?  The answer is a radical breakthrough that  Wired  says is "the rocket fuel of the AI."

GME and Tom Brady
As many of you probably don't know, GME IPO'd only 8 days after Tom Brady's first super bowl win in 2002. With today being his 10th, I thought I'd look into how that affects the stonk that resembles everything the Come Back Kid is: doubted, hated, but never ignored.  Below are the the returns over the 90s after the Super Bowl indexed to their close the Friday prior to it. (with exception of 2002 which I used the IPO Price    Days after SB   TB Wins   TB Loses      - 30       60        90          As you can see, the current score line (31 to 9 for TB) is a bullish sign for GME  Here are the year by year breakdown:  Days after SB Tom Brady win? 30 Days 60 Days 90 Days      -     2002 Win       2004 Win       2005 Win       2008 Lose       2012 Lose       2015 Win       2017 Win       2018 Lose       2019 Win           This is not financial advice, purely academic. I hold no GME.
Feb 9th GME Short Interest Data
I have some theories about the  short interest data coming out 2/9 that will include shorts that have settled by 1/29.   If shorts settle T+2, and it’s only reporting shorts settled by 1/29, that would be trades executed 1/27 or before.  Missing any data from that Thursday fuckery by Robinhood etc and the following Friday with the all time high.   Between 1/14-1/21 it traded in a very tight range   with good volume. Could that have been people covering their shorts. Is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 1/22 trading day jump(which could of been caused by large shorts being covered and HFs booking losses). If you go back to that week and search for news regarding GME by each day. On 1/22 you see a giant spike in GMe articles, media talking about it, Jim Cramer tweeted out 1/22 that GME was a squeeze of a life time etc. this Reddit blew up etc. Will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory  but..  anyone who shorted the stock from 1/25-1/27 is going to add to the short interest number in the 1/29 report. Any shorts established between 1/25-1/27 made huge profits last week and could of been covered. Meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore.   Because the market is reacting 100x faster to GME moves than it was prior to the 1/15 data is SI data becoming less powerful as a predictor?   Thoughts?
Saving Private WoooooG. I'm still down here in the NYSE trenches with a $700k loss. The Hedge Funds blew off my legs, but at least I still have my diamond hands. Y'all still coming for me right?

The Future of Robinhood
I’ve been thinking about what becomes of a broker that can’t handle the stresses of volatile markets. We have a system where the strong survive and the weak get devoured. It’s hard to imagine Robinhood will endure given the events of these past few weeks, so what becomes of them? Well, they have something of value, but clearly do not have the infrastructure or the know how to swim in the ocean with the other sharks. It is my belief, that they will be acquired, and if I had to guess? It’ll be Goldman. The shiniest white shoes on the street have expanded into the consumer market with Marcus, and their biggest rival, Morgan Stanley, just bought E-trade. Acquiring a retail broker makes a lot of sense, but Goldman has had a problem. Who could they buy? In terms of US based brokers, all the appropriate sized acquisition targets had been picked off, until now. I think it would be a win-win, because ‘Robinhood, a Goldman Sachs Company’ solves a lot of problems. No one would ever question Robinhood’s solvency again. Goldman would oust the ‘broker bros’ like Vlad that clearly are in way over their heads, will gain millions of accounts, and strengthen their position in the consumer market.    This is complete speculation, not financial advice, and you should draw your own conclusions.   For all you lazy autists:   TLDR: I think Goldman will buy Robinhood.

Why to REALLY buy GME (Solid DD)
LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons).   Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough.   When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward.   Fils-Aimé the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago)   Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle.   We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth.   Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop.   Most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.  Conservative price target: $200 by mid 2021 with little hype and absent a short squeeze  Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock.   But what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions 5200 shares GME, 52x covered calls sold exp 2/12, 50x calls bought exp 2/26, a few bucks in cash waiting for a drop if it happens. Tell if I'm wrong somewhere with sources linked please and thank you.  Edit: As requested, my average cost is roughly $60 after buying back in late last week. I had original shares at an average buy in of about $30 assigned to covered calls on 1/29. I believed the company had too much downside at those prices.  Obligatory                   👩‍
The Chinese New Year
I’ve seen both views online about what may happen to stocks during the Chinese New Year. I see their market is closed. This is my first year owning Chinese companies, NIO and BABA and I’m long on both. I’m interested in what actual shareholders have experienced in previous years during the holiday. Over the past 6 months of being on WSB I trust your judgment and opinions more than any random articles written online.

XLM coming up
💠 Over the last week it's come up 60% 💠  💠 Over the last month it's come up 100% 💠  While trending not as fast as I'd like I admit. If we were all to love this stonk coin to death.... Well it's worth . 55 and has a high trading volume relatively speaking so you can imagine   It would help recoup loses for people over GME and be a safer bet then trying to get a short squeeze.  I have a some money invested, not much 4,000 and I've seen it come up to $6000  Just look at the trend line yourself on any website and you'll immediately see what I'm talking about. It's slower growth but XLM is far more likely to become a stable currency one day, in my opinion.  This is something I truly believe people would benefit from. It's much easier to get something to the moon that's still on Earth  If you disagree or agree I'd love to hear other people's opinions!  Thank atheismo for this subreddit haha
AAL - anecdotal information
For anyone intending to go long on AAL, beware, I'm not sure how this is going on other airlines, I assume its the same, but the load factors have fallen off of a cliff since mid January.  What once were almost full flights are now going out with less than 1/3 capacity and empty first class seats, indicating business travellers are nowhere to be seen  I fly about 2x a month and was long AA until a couple of weeks ago when the stock issuance announcement left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.. I'm a top tier frequent flyer with nearly 2 million lifetime miles on AA and I've never seen it this bad for this long, even after 9/11 business flyers were back after a month or two   I'd expect a pretty bad quarter unlike the last which was actually pretty promising.
Robinhood is ignoring my emails re: changing phone number. Is there any way to get in touch with someone who can do something?
Old account with an old phone number. RH changed policy at some point a week ago and you have to SMS confirm that you want to buy/sell/trade. Discovered this, went to update my phone number to my new number and RH wants to send an SMS to confirm TO THE OLD NUMBER   I've lost money because they refuse to get back to me. "I don't have access to this number" gets me to the help center which takes me to a form, which promises they will get back to me within 3 days. It's been a week.   I'm ready to leave RH but they won't let me.

DD - Patience is a Virtu
Well done. Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.    Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts.     So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard):       For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail.   THE TREND IS INCREASING   for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of     Billion   . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at   Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders.   100 Million   thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks.     TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.    OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:        $VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year.       Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times   millions   of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless   Fuck Melvin  .    So what else? $VIRT has provided a $  dividend for   22 consecutive quarters   and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to "meaningfully enhance shareholder returns" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on   Feb 11th  . Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $  in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $  and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~  $    with a PE of      . Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table.     TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT  Positons:     Planning on converting to shares for long term holding with an eventual PT of $100 by end of 2021.
No One Cares That You Held GME
That’s it, read the title. Sick bro you have diamond hands and big balls bc you were too stupid to sell the pump?  Oh you read a post about short ladder attacks and short interest is still over 100%? The squeeze hasn’t squoze yet?   While you 7 million newbies bought the top and downvoted anything that didn’t say DiAmOnD hAnDs the real OGs dumped actual trash on you at $400 a share.   Congrats on having IQs below your GPAs, no one is gonna buy GME back up to pump your bags. You just paid tuition, welcome to the show.  Can we back to good DDs and YOLOs that are actually entertaining? The GME losses are just getting sad.
What happens with Diamond Hands?
The case for VSTO
Fellow degenerates, ammo is the next play. Hear me out.  Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round.   So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington.   VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before.   The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this.   I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies.   TLDR: Ammo sales are exploding (literally), buy the main beneficiary VSTO.

Interesting buy (Clorox)
Flame me if you want on this if you would like, I work with Costco and notice member buying trends but I’m sure there’s a fellow autist that will share my enthusiasm on this. Clorox (CLX) has gone from 144-165 in the past three months however in the last week it went from 155-165. I’ve noticed at least in my warehouse that we have added an extra Clorox pallet to the floor merch now having two palets of Clorox cleaning wipes and Clorox spray next to each other. I restock a pallet or two every day from each as people are buying that shizz full price and running home with it.   TL:DR Clorox went up 20 points in the last three months but has raised 10 points in the last 7 days to play around 165$
Huge Tip: OCGN Legit Opportunity
Covid vaccine involved company. They recently announced a major partnership with Bharat Biotech to make Covaxin. From everything I read, the clinical trials are about to go live. If the drug works properly, it’s going to be huge because the storage requirements for Covaxin are much less stringent than other vaccines on the market. I’m already up big from finding them and investing early. Do your research as with anything, but in WSB terms OCGN      Edit: this wasn’t posted pre-blowup, but I still think if the clinical trials are successful this still has massive upside.
Why $AMD is gonna blow its load SOON 15k YOLO
Disclaimer: Not financial Advice.

Most genius or retarded play
Retards, listen up.  UPDATE: CLOSED MY POSITION  So a while back I YOLOed my entire account on calls and  . Like a sensible "investor" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking "what's the fastest way I can make my money back?". Selling puts of course.   So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.   POSITIONS:
If you're holding AMC because "after covid, people will want to go back to the theaters ", you should reconsider.
A percentage of the population will want to go back to theaters for a movie, sure, but nowhere near the extent that some people here keep dreaming about.  For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.  Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.  The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.  It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the "old days". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the "old days" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change. At best, a bump in traffic when restrictions are lifted then back to losing stock value.  I'm a financial advisor to myself.
ROKU. $50,000 to $700,000. Holding for $1,000,000.
February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates
For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.  The size of the move depends mainly on two things:  \- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.  \- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.  Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.  Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:  I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):    11 Feb 21  , addressable market: small   15 Feb 21  , addressable market: large   25 Feb 21  , addressable market: small   28 Feb 21  , addressable market: small   28 Feb 21  , addressable market: small   28 Feb 21  , addressable market: medium  My positions:  I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.  SRPT 100C 3/19 \[ \]  ATNX 15C 3/19 + Shares \[ \]     Disclaimer:  As mentioned, these are bets, with odds probably better than 50%. I'm not a financial advisor!
Something I noticed people have confused about DFV and WSB.
Real quick, lets just clear the air. WSB has ALWAYS been filled with assholes and degenerates. DFV took his beatings the ENTIRE time until it paid off. WSB doesn't play nice, if you post expect to be ridiculed ruthlessly lol.  That said, his name is DEEPFUCKINGVALUE. He did DEEPFUCKINGVALUE plays, I'm talking warren buffet level 4-D chess lol.  He didnt chase trends. Or buy something because someone told him so. He was ruthless and logical in his belief that AT THAT TIME, it was a very intelligent decision. He had his CFA. He KNEW what he was getting into.  Be like DFV. Unless you're a degenerate gambler ready to lose it all. In which   your next play? (Legit asking)  Edit: Disclaimer i dont own ANY stocks or options right now, waiting for a play. No bias for or against GME.  Edit2: for specifics on DFV's qualifications and experience.
A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions.
I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.  The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.  Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\ (Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\ (Likelihood of Occurrence))    If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.   If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.   If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.  With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.  So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.  So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,  Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.  EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,  gain)(5% likelihood)  EV=(   EV=((  (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)  And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a   chance to fail versus   chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than  , not 4%,  , I should at least HOLD my position.  “SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!”  “YEEAHHH!” -Lloyd Christmas    Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.   (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)  Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.  TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.
Serious question about robinhood
Hey guys, I asked this on r/robinhood already and got a quick ban because it pertains to me getting off of robinhood. Basically I have some assets that I need to liquidate to be able to get off Robinhood and I want to immediately reinvest that money. I want to use the ACH and routing numbers on my RH that correlate to my cash management account to make deposits on a different exchange without having to withdraw the money to my bank account. I already started trying to set it up and it requires that they make deposits to my RH and then let me verify the amounts. Does anyone have any idea if this will work or is it a wild goose chase???
Why Clean energy is still the high IQ play in 2021. Solar, Hydrogen, Nuclear. DD Inside.
Why is energy still the play and why will it let you retire in the few years?  General:  During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‘08 ‘09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]         Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He’s working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his “Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment” which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]         Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.     Hydrogen:  Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it’s truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. “  the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]      Nuclear:: Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.          Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories.

Me dreaming about our fight for GME last night
DD: Financial sectors within emerging markets
Okay retards. I know most of you can’t read but this sub has been seriously lacking in the DD department.       The WSB I subbed to is not the same as the WSB today, so for the newbies: GME NOK BB      . For everyone else:      Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in.       The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized.       The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven’t fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you’re like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you. For consumer products, my play is Coca-Cola. These are long term plays so don’t expect 30% in two days. Of course, invest at your own risk.      Positions: All banks: shares; KO: $55C 6/18      Interesting read just on Africa:
Robinhood colluding with Citadel to halt buying of meme stocks isn't the most likely scenario - and other comments
Can go here if you want to see the other side:    This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.  1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze? 2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW,  't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me. 3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a  's not their thing. 4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv? 5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it. 6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%. 7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up. 8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?  Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage. I made a lot of mistakes during the run, but have come out so far with about 150% profit (could have been over 1000% if I played it a lot better)
Is there a difference between the GME squeeze and AMC squeeze. And is it possible to maybe save one?
So I am a smooth brained ape who got into the squeeze without fully understanding it like most. Now I am not trying to pursued anyone to doing anything but I was wondering if it was possible to to get some traction again by doing something desperate... So I know I will get stoned for this but what if we just focused all our efforts on AMC. What if we all moved out position to AMC I was thinking considering the price difference we could still make some significant volume changes if we all moved positions. To be clear I am in both GME and AMC but personally I believe AMC is the safer bet in the long rung with or without the possible squeeze. So what if all us Ape just focus on getting AMC to the moon. Would it be possible to start beating the hedge funds again?
Current Vibe of The Market just feel off to anyone else?
The stock market is nothing but human reaction, that is what we were taught right? Maybe I ate so many crayons that a cancerous cyst is growing on my brain, maybe my bones ache in the wind, but does it feel to anyone else like we’re teetering on the edge? I don’t know if it’s a crash, a pump, or both.   There is no tangible evidence I can point to. So if you can, please talk me out of this. Yea I know this is retarded.   I wouldn’t normally feel bearish, which is why this feeling is so odd. The similarities between now and the other great financial crashes are great. The people that understand the fundamentals, they’re saying a day of reckoning is coming. I should be happy, yet I can’t help but feel the party is about to end. Does anyone else feel me? Or is this just misplaced autism
You gotta take the profit at some point!
I am not a market genius, I am just a fellow autist who buys anything on DD page, but you guys need to listen to me. You HAVE to take profit at some point. The stocks don’t go to infinity, it’s just a meme! So stop hyping people to invest their life savings on a weed stock that is in Canada, it doesn’t even make sense. You are ruining people’s lives for that. I know that you are not a financial advisor and you don’t force them to buy anything, but in deep down you know that you really want the stock to pump so that you can take profit. Stop that.  Edit: Sell at a target and take profit, nothing stays up forever. We always say that MMs and big money boyz are manipulating this sub and media, but actually we are manipulating ourselves. Don’t fall for their own game.
Why don't we 10x A stock young Folks can hold like $NNDM. (ARK OWNS 6 Million Shares)
Seriously if we are going  to town on stocks why don't  we go all APE Shit on stocks that will 10x in a couple of years and just do it now? $NNDM IS SERIOUSLY A 10x STOCK cause big institutions like (ARK INVESTMENT) have done their due diligence for us, SO WHY NOT SECURE THE BAG that they already holding. ITS A NO BRAINER INVESTMENT MOVE, and there is 0% chance they will suspend/halt the stock just because so many hedge funds are backing $NNDM. DIAMOND HANDS BABY.
This is for all you broke idgets who want to play with SPY, but don’t have enough cash. $SPLG.
$SPLG tracks the S&P 500 just like $SPY, and holy shit, it’s managed by the same people who run $SPY. Look at the charts, it looks exactly the same, and google that shit for verification. It’s the same fucking thing, just smaller.   Have you wanted to buy SPY calls and been too broke from bagholding meme stonks? Now’s your chance to taste some actual victory in the market even with your tiny ass account that got fucked by the last dump meme stonks took on it.   Play today, and win. Not financial advice, I think you idiots will lose money and fuck up retail investing for the rest of us. Have fun.
Listen you retarded apes, all you crayon eating autistic idiots need to only do one thing, buy GME and never log into your account again. Set a trading alert on yahoo finance for $500 and then start watching when you receive the alert.
You idiots trying to swing trade this are trying to get crumbs while fucking up 1000 loafs if you strap your balls on and go to the moon         🏻   I would explain the math to you guys, but you clearly can't read. Don't be fooled by the news alerts being sent to your phone. If it's written in big red letters that Melvin capital sold their whole position on TV, it means they didn't sell, you retarded crayon eating wimpy retards.   This is definitely not financial advice, because you are surely retarded.  Ps. Your wife said hi Hun  🏻 she'll be back once you make some real tendies 🐔 💵 🍖💰🍗
GME? BLACKBERRY? AMC?? WEED STOCKS?? COINCIDENCE? NO!!
Recently some weird stuff has been going on in the market as I’m sure many of you are aware. It started with GameStop and WSB. As soon as they(Hedge Funds and Wall Street ppl) started looking into this subreddit the stock just plummets.   Around the same time AMC and BB where on a rally and people on WSB were catching on and big Hedge Funds and Wall Street people also took notice and those also significantly fell.   Certain weed stocks started rallying so hard and once again Reddit was on it. The day after all the weed stonks talk on WSB brought a huge dip for them.   Now obviously something is going on here. I like numbers and started looking at them but nothing was adding up. Why were these things happening? BUT I figured it out. At first I started to think the answers wasn’t in the numbers but it is !!!! Just think about! Why would all big HFs and Wall Street people do this?   🔥 DISCOUNT BBY🔥  They’re standing on their yachts or standing on top of the tallest New York building on Wall Street and screaming in CoD zombies voice “ FIRE SALE” to all the new retail investors coming to explore the world of stocks! All these stocks are so cheap now and affordable and they can only go up after this !! Cuz we all know stonks only go up      Enjoy the discount friends
No selling
The perfect trading plan
So here is my new expert trading strategy. 1. Pick whatever stock you retards are currently pumping 2. Yolo 90% of everything you have into shares 3. Spend rest of money on far otm puts (but not to far out) that expire in 2 weeks. 4. Profit when stock crashes right after you buy, and prophet if stock miraculously keeps pumping.  5. If stocks still pumping, sell amount equivalent to your profit and roll money back into more puts 6. Continue until stock finally divebombs and you make a cool 1000% return, or you run out of shares to sell and wait for either expiration or the stock tanks.  7. Sell all options on Friday so they dont fucking expire into nothing.   it works best with min of 100 shares owned and 10 otm puts that will gain at least 100$ per point.   Pros: takes advantage of bag holding paper handed losers and stock hype, but still gets you great returns if the stock moons.  Cons: you lose the options premium if the stock trades flat for a week. You need alot of liquidity to make it work with any stock over 50$ Doesn't work on anything with absurd IV  Throw your opinions at me if you want but I dont GAF because y'all know more about the flavor of your own earwax then you do the stockmarket.  Edit: changed prophet to profit sry English is my first language and I'm still getting used to it.

Stock Market 101: You're on your own
Because this subreddit has turned into teaching Finance while babysitting, I'd like to make sure you guys understand something. There's no such thing as paper hands vs diamond hands.  This isn't some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing. "paper hands" are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags. Now depending on the situation, they might not leave bags, and people with diamond hands make more money. Sometimes, paper hands are right.                                                                                                                                                                                  That is because... drum roll... it's all about supply and demand. This is especially true in options, because they are zero-sum. That means someone will come out a loser. This idea that if we all hOLd tHE LiNE then the stock will keep going up is simply untrue. This isn't your modern dodge-ball where everyone comes out with participation trophies. Someone will be left with the bag, and that will be you if you don't start being skeptical and selling the top.                                                                                                                                 There are people that FOMO'd into weed yesterday. This is the result of people thinking stonks only go up.                                               Last note: Lots of you. I mean, lots of you entered into the stock market for the FIRST time due to GME. Your first impression is that all hyped stocks will go from $4 to $450. Not at all true. What happened with GME is a once in a decade play. Whether you argue it's alive or dead isn't the point. Stop speculating that every stock will be like GME and lock your damn profits!                                                                                                                               If $GME$ hits $150 this week I will buy every single item on r/activedeals & donate it to my local hospital.
TLRY and APHA - Massive Arbitrage potential?
It seems that many of those buying Tilray stock are unaware of the impending merger between Tilray and Aphria. Upon the merger, Aphria shareholders are due to have their shares converted into Tilray shares by a ratio of 84%. This also applies to calls. At the current price, Aphria is massively undervalued compared to Tilray, and it should be trading at over $60 a share in order to match the merger value.  Seems to me that Aphria stock is the way to go, no?
A big thank you to WSB
I would like to thank this community for getting me to start trading. After finishing business school i was disapointed at the entire prospect of working in my field (PR and Management) as most entry positions were either complete bullshit or nonexistant. I went to make a career out of my hobby, videoediting. Its been a successful career and ive gotten to a point where im well off enough to be able to throw some money around without risking much. Cue WSB. I had known about this reddit group for some time but didnt really pay much attention, until GME happened. I opened a trading acc and put in 650€ - a measly   shares... yes yes, i was late as fuck, but hear me out. I lost 85% within no time at all, but while looking at my portfolio every 15 seconds I invested into a bunch of other things like criptic currency and a few other stocks, including OCGN. Well, i got back my losses on GME and then some. And with my business education background i have a basic understanding of how the markets work. Now i can see this as a potential source of additional income for my family and myself. So thank you WSB!!!  All the best to all of you!  D
Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood
Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.    You really want to know who stole your tendies?   Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked.    Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:      Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?    Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused  opening positions . So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.  Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.    If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?    First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume  more than doubled  in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.    Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots    You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever???   I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest  increased  back to pre-restriction levels.   Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??      Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.    If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r 2 =   That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.    So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down.   Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to    when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.    tldr   you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.

Genuine Question- Do You Feel You Can Make Money Investing?
I don’t want to sound like r/investing, but I was surprised at how many new comers seem to believe the stock market is literally rigged against them... that just isn’t the case.  I know we hate the founder, but his original vision is very much alive and well today. He was a guy who was more interested in finance and public markets than most and wanted to have a forum where he could discuss single stock trades. He tried this on other outlets but was always told “that’s too risky” “most stock pickers underperform” “you are better off buying index funds”. The thing is, all of that is very much true, the only difference with us is that we know this and we understand the risks we take buying single stocks & options.  If you came here because you thought GameStop was the only way to make money in the market, then you need to take a step back and do some research. We take big risks here, but again, we know they’re risky and we know what we should be doing— in fact most of us largely save via index funds and trade as a hobby.  I genuinely encourage all new members to come back after you’ve watched some videos on portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, asset allocation, and the efficient market hypothesis. Almost anyone can make money buying index funds. It might not be huge money, but it’s how most people are able to retire these days.   Most people who get rich on single stocks were already rich or they got those stocks by being employees of the company via compensation. Most options expire worthless (theta gang). You should know your risks before you come in with your nihilistic outlook and try to protest hedge funds by taking the losing end of their trades.
I need some answers on the GME Squeeze.
Can someone with actual experience in investing help me out?   So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).    Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?     Keep the trolling and speculation to a minimum please. I need people who actually know what they are talking about... not speculation of "the squeeze already happened" or the other side of "it's going to the moon"
Fundamentals/technicals of dtcc setting collateral requirements
Going from 2-100% overnight LEGENDARILY fucked people and pleased only those who held gme shorts  How does this process work on a nuts and bolts calculation process?  Is it algorithms?  Is it a cabal of augurs sifting through offal?  All resources that I've found say that no one has any idea wtf is going on behind the scenes, that it's completely opaque. Sus af.  Lots of people on this forum in recent arguments with me insist it is all above board and totally legit but I can't find whatever information they've found that seems to back up their perspectives.  This is one aspect of fundamentals where a deep dive seems warranted  EDIT - I've been reading bunches of sec filings, rule changes, and specifically trying to find risk profiles to compare similar collateral requirements for companies in times past. would love to see the risk profiles here

The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future
This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.    What is CLNE?    Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it   The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.  CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).  CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after      Why Natural Gas?    As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move  . With demand for natural gas   up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.    Increasing Natural Gas Demand    Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again),  .  We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now.     . I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.    Partnerships    CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP,  . With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture.   With Total   to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million.   These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.    Expansion    Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).  I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI.     The Numbers    Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.    The Play    As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year.     I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that. I still think CLNE is a strong play and will be adding to my positions.
SGMO tldr 🎁
SGMO TLDR  THIS IS NOT STOCK ADVICE, JUST EDUCATIONAL/ENTERTAINMENT (maybe lol) AND MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.    SGMO TLDR   1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.  2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)  3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR   At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.  4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.  5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price  6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it’s a good stock are exact reason why it’s a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)  Want more details about the reasoning behind each TLDR point check these well done DDs previously posted and do yer own DD.               I have and am buying stock and OTM CALLS 3 months out and further.  Goodluck mouth breathers you will need it.  Edit1 -Link to pic of proof of positions
How to read DD on WSB.
So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?  Analyze their analysis!  First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.  Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, "I don't wanna but good luck all".  Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, "how reasonable does this seem"?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.  Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose  how  you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a "how to judge random idiots on the internet" expert.  Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet   against   the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.  Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.  tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape:
BlackBerry this is a song for you.
Woke up quick at about noon   Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon   I gotta get drunk before the day begins   Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends   About to go and damn near went blind   Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs   Ran in the house and grabbed my clip   With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip   Bailed outside and pointed my weapon   Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'   Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride   I got front back and side to side   Then I let the Alpine play   Bumpin' new shit by NWA   It was "Gangsta Gangsta" at the top of the list   Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this  Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'   Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes   Went to the park to get the scoop   Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops   A car pulls up, who can it be?   A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G   He rolls down his window and he started to say   It's all about makin' that GTA  'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard   You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card   Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit   Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit  Down on B's in the place to give me the pace   He said my man JB is on freebase   The boy JB was a friend of mine   Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine   Chased him up the street to call a truce   The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce   Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge   One sucker dead, LA Times front page  'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard   You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card   Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit   Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit  Bored as hell and I wanna get ill   So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill   The fellows out there, makin' that dollar   I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala   They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'   And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'   Left to get my girl, to rock that body   Before I left I hit the Bacardi   Went to her house to get her out of the pad   Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad   She said somethin' that I couldn't believe   So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave   She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?   Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe   Her father jumped up and he started to shout   So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out  'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard   You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card   Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit   Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit  I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control   Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll   I looked at my car and I said, "Oh brother   I throw it in the gutter and go buy another"   Walkin home and I see the G ride   Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side   As they busted a U, they got pulled over   An undercover cop in a dark green Nova   Kat got beat for resistin arrest   He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess   Now G is cut for doin the crime   For defense on the boy, he'll do some time  'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard   You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card   Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit   Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit  I went to get them out but there was no bail   The fellaz start to riot in the county jail   Two days later in municipal court   Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork   "Disruption of the court", said the judge   On a six year sentence my man didn't budge   Bailiff came over to turn him in   Kilo G looked up and gave a grin   He yelled out "fire!", then came Suzi   The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi   Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her   Both up state for attempted murder  'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard   You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card   Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit   Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit
Don't let people shame you into buying, selling, or holding your stock
I jumped on the train like everyone else, but began to notice a lot of malice and discord between people who think differently about the future of these meme stocks.  The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who "just like the stock", or those that say sell because they are "shills" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.  At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I've seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price. Don't put in what you can't risk to lose; it isn't worth it.  TL;DR - If you want to buy - buy. If you want to hold - hold. If you want to sell - sell. But for fuck's sake be careful.
Power to the Bag Holders!
A True Autists DD on why r/wallstreetbets is now forever shit.
Ok autists. Listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking about r/wallstreetbets and the shit going on with Gamestop and its effects on the various communities.   To add a quick interject of experience, I'm a one year trader who found wsb about three/four months ago, loved the loss porn, and got really taken for a ride with the whole GME experience.  I've been thinking about the different groups and how WSB was before and after. I only ever saw WSB as 'advice' until during and after GME. Again, wsb was a casino. It was for idiots to throw cash at a yolo and MAYBE. MAAAAAYYBEE. Make money. It was to see idiot kids and even more retarded adults throw a 1/50 lottery ticket. If you want 1/5 literally take the years to become an investor. It's hard. The adage 'if it was easy everyone would do it' remains true here.  Now I think people are starting to look at WSBs as real investing. Which if you're doing stop right now. The weed yolo is an example of scaling. GME took about 2-3 weeks for major media and the investing world to catch on. Weed took 2-3 days. The next one will be hours. People are watching r/wallstreetbets. And eyes will stay on for at least a year. Deep money will not take money off of sending a few bots to pick out the top mentioned, or even just a list of all, stock tickers for a least a decade. WSB is over. The hedgefunds learned their lesson. And if they somehow are the assininely stupid give them 2-3 more. You need to find something new if you want what wsbs gave you. Something they have not thought of, are not looking at, or have not thought to look for. Nothing less will have their eyes on it.  That being said if this doesnt get a lot of upvotes and anyone has an ideas of what that might be please let me know I want to see idiots lose money where it's not sad af.
Apes that exited out at $480 GME hyper squeeze. 🌴🌴💰 🐒 🌴🌴

RH sent me a BS email back about the support ticket I sent them a while ago
Thanks for getting in touch with us—I definitely want to address your concerns.     We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks from January 28 to February 4 were frustrating, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.     To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote   Here’s a summary of the letter:    For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.   Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm’s customers hold. If a firm’s customers’ holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.   Last week, in part due to   in some popular stocks, Robinhood’s deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks.    We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations.   We didn’t want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren’t trying to help hedge funds.    We stand with everyday investors participating in the market and we’ll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system.    I know you may still have questions, so feel free to reply to this email. I’m here to help however I can.     Sincerely,
WSBGod - Searching For The Truth
So, good old W S B G o d posted on his Twitter that he's buying a $3,000,000 car with all of his sick gains. I've seen claims that he's using Inspect Element to fake his gains, but I don't know for sure. Also, people have done reverse-image searches on this picture, and it's surely an original photo. Does anyone have proof if he's legit or not, or is he really on a one-way street to tendie town?     Positions: 20 March 19 GME $20 calls
It wasn't just RH, all brokerage firms did the same thing.
Maybe we can all take a step back and stop s        on Robin Hood only, all the other brokerage firms did the exact same thing for almost the exact same amount of time. Fidelity, vanguard, TD Ameritrade, Schwab, webull etc... Don't get me wrong I'm upset at all of them, but they are all co-conspirators in this, so those of you leaving RH for these other brokerages, I don't see what you are gaining. All these brokerages were subject to the demands of the market makers and clearing houses. This goes deeper than just Robin Hood. I made this post because I feel as though the community is becoming myopic on Robinhood rather than all brokerages and institutions involved. Thank you.  Edit: I have Ameritrade, Schwab, fidelity, and vanguard, they all were either shut down multiple times, or flat out would not allow purchasing of GameStop.        Edit 2: I'm not defending Robin Hood, I am saying don't just throw shade at Robin Hood you should throw shade at everyone because they were all culpable to one degree or another.
Keith Gill / DeepFuckingValue Tribute
Brothers, sisters, bisters, and sothers.  We come today to pay tribute to our good friend Keith Gill   the messenger of the god of retards known as DFV.  In the next week Congress and their wife's boyfriend will be questioning our beloved Keith Gill why he didn't use lube after destroying Melvin Capital's rectum.  I want this thread to blow up and make sure every last one of us shows our support for our beloved friend before he goes into battle and is asked the same question more than 69 times.  Moment of silence.....    We shall now proceed....  Repeat after me:  We like the stocks we trade!  We trade for ourselves! We do not take financial advice from anyone but ourselves! Weed are not retarded!       Let us remember when GME was $483!!!  Let us start the count to 483 brothers. Every subsequent reply please show your support by adding one dollar per comment per Hedgefund overlord tear.  I will start the count first!    !
Why cant we post DD on Companies in the Cripto space?
I feel like its a seriously viable marketplace and there is money to be made. But we arent able to discuss it or post any sort of DD on any of the companies related to Cripto. Just want to know what you guys think and if some of you guys agree? I seriously cannot find any other sub that lets you post DD on any publically traded company relating to cripto. The cripto subs dont really talk the stock markets, and any of the stocks/investing/pennystocks subs talk cripto lol.  There are many publically traded companies in the market that have huge potential.     Edit: Also, u/LegalHelpNeeded3 Made me realize why small caps like these can be dangerous to this sub and i guess i was just so excited about the companies that it slipped my mind when I made the post. It makes sense in your comments why the rule exists. Although it is an emerging market, it is still small enough to be more prone to things like pump and dumps.  Edit: for u/momreview420 who kindly asked for pics
Virpax Pharmaceuticals IPO? Sounds iffy...
So with the 3 day weekend coming I'm slowly dying of boredom because the green and red lines stopped moving. Only have 3 bananas left. Must ration.  Anyway... I came across the upcoming IPO of Virpax Pharmaceuticals. Ticker VRPX. They are planning to produce topical pain relief meds. All money to be raised for R&D and paying off debt. I'm interested, but don't have much experience with IPOs such as this. Will it pump at launch? Just go flat because they have nothing at this point? What's the consensus among 🦧?  I don't want any financial advice whatsoever; just your retarded opinions.
CERENCE: A REAL DD YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS!
Cerence (CRNC):   A real DD (WARNING NOT A MEME STOCK)        Company profile:        Cerence builds   AI powered virtual assistants   for the mobility/transportation market   including but not limited to two-wheel vehicles, planes, tractors, cruise ships and elevators.      Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between vehicles, drivers and passengers, and the broader digital world. We are a   premier provider   of AI- powered assistants and innovations for connected and autonomous vehicles, including one of the world’s most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants, such as “Hey BMW” and “Ni hao Banma”.       Market Capitalization:        Cerence has a market cap of just   $5 billion  . As a play on two of the hottest growth segments (EV and AI), Cerence has and likely will continue to see prolific growth.         Customer Profile:          CERENCE products are in 53% OF ALL NEW CARS SHIPPED in 2020. This equates to 38 MILLION cars alone in 2020 and 325 million vehicles to date.           Customers include all major automobile original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide, including BMW, Daimler, FCA Group, Ford, Geely, GM, Renault-Nissan, SAIC, Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, DENSO TEN and Harman. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between their brands and end users. Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable, safer journey for everyone.           Competitive Strengths:    (directly from 10K)        Industry-leading speech-related technology            Hybrid edge-cloud system architecture   Our software platform’s hybrid architecture combines the performance, reliability and tight integration that only edge software can provide with the flexibility of cloud connectivity.         Bespoke vehicle integration and acoustic tuning   Cognitive assistance for categories such as navigation, entertainment and control require tight integration with onboard vehicle components, which vary widely among vehicle models. Separately, speech interaction systems can be significantly   by the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin and must be tuned for particular acoustics and audio system components. To achieve the tight vehicle integration necessary to address these concerns, our professional services team works closely with OEMs and suppliers to customize our offerings for the particular characteristics of specific vehicle models.         Broad language coverage   Our software platform supports over 70 languages and dialects, far more than any of our competitors. As a result of our broad language support, our customers are already delivering cognitive assistance based on our software platform in over 60 countries across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including China, the   and all other large automotive markets. Our language support also enables multi-lingual capabilities for domains such as music selection, point-of-interest selection, and cross-border navigation among others, representing a critical feature for markets such as Continental Europe in which automobiles may routinely traverse multiple lingual zones. We believe that our portfolio of languages and multi-lingual capabilities represent an important competitive advantage, as the development of capabilities to support a new language is expensive and time-consuming.         Broad, global network of deep relationships with OEMs and tier 1 suppliers   We have supplied speech recognition systems to OEMs and suppliers for over 20 years, working closely with our customers through our global professional services organization to design and integrate our solutions into their brands.         Competitors:   A real DD always addresses the competitive landscape.       Large technology companies   Many large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, offer Internet-based virtual assistants. Given the popularity in general of these virtual assistants, we believe that automobile drivers and riders increasingly desire the ability to use them as part of the mobility experience.          Small, focused competitors   We compete for business directly with certain companies focused on voice-based virtual assistance, including SoundHound in the  , iFlyTek in China, and other regional and technology-focused competitors. These companies have had some success selling into our customer base. However, we believe that we have multiple meaningful competitive advantages, including our scale, our globally distributed team, our best-in-class portfolio of compatible languages, and our deep focus on the automotive market. We also believe that our technology, particularly our speech signal enhancement and acoustic tuning, is superior based on benchmarking results against our competitors. We believe we will continue to be able to compete successfully against these competitors as we continue to invest in our offerings.         Competitors (My analysis):         I appreciate that Cerence's auditors make sure they address all potential risks. However, I do not see big tech as a threat. I see them as a "gain-guarantee." Cerence's AI is years ahead of the big players and Cerence’s small peers. The biggest risk I see here is that a company--ahem like AAPL or Google--might purchase Cerence. Cerence's market cap makes it a likely candidate of a buyout in the future.          Revenues:         Revenues are up to $326 Million for fiscal year 2020.   $95 Million in Q1 2021   literally on pace for 25% revenue growth.            Gross Margin:       72% gross margin in the most recent fiscal quarter. Huge margins which is extremely attractive.      Research and Development:         The best expense on the income statement in my opinion. Cerence has had negative net incomes in the past few fiscal years due primarily to R&D costs. This maintains and expands their already vast competitive advantage.       “We believe that continued investment in research and development will be critical for us to continue to deliver market-leading solutions for automotive cognitive assistance. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our product portfolio and allocate capital and resources to our growth opportunities.”      Balance Sheet:        $1,700,000,000 assets to $700,000,000 liabilities. For my finance guys, a   current ratio. $266 bil in LTD.            Goodwill is a concentrated risk that makes up most of their assets (over $1 billion). Definitely not the best.       Cash flows:        Cash flow from op positive.          Why this is the best play out on the market right now:  .      Growing company in a niche industry with massive upside potential     Market leader     Strong Financials    Net Income Positive    Undervalued as fuck        TLDR: AI Company that does voice recognition in 53% of all new vehicles, revenues are up 25% YoY, small market capitalization, primed for massive growth.            My price target: $250 EOY (Disclosure: went super long at $49 and this is not financial advice)                    TICKER IS CRNC

The only reason GME is where it is right now is through blatant market manipulation.   On January 28th GME was over $500 pre market. It had sensational momentum. Buying GME on the 27th at $300+ was not a bad play. GME had already gravity slingshotted round Earth and had blown past the moon, on course to leave the fucking Milky Way. The shorts were completely fucking fucked. They were done. Dead. Bags heavier than a dying star. About to be squeezed so hard they’d turn into hand shaped diamonds. And then suddenly they weren’t.   It wasn’t fucking short laddering that saved them. It wasn’t fucking “hedge fund tactics.” It wasn’t synthetic longs. It wasn’t a bear raid (look it up, this is what they are actually doing ). It wasn’t cause gme was a silly meme play. none of this is what stopped the inter dimensional GME rocket.    What saved them? Market manipulation. “They” (dtc/ brokers / clearing houses whoever) changed the rules and essentially banned buying the stock.  They locked the (retail at least) market out of one side of a trade. The fuck?  They didn’t halt the stock.    They didn’t suspend it.    The stock wasn’t halted by the exchanges. No That would stop all trading.    They just stopped people  buying . Kill the demand and surprise! supply overtakes demand  and price drops like your wife’s pants when her bf is in town.   But why?  If they hadn’t restricted buying? Well the shorts would be bankrupt. But they can’t let retail win. Specially fucking Reddit. Retail investors are idiots remember. Institutions are far smarter than that bunch.   The big boys can’t have retail win. That’s preposterous. So just stop em buying. You do that to  any stock  and it would absolutely tank. Its mind blowing how blatant it was.   And this was all to get themselves out a terrible situation they engineered through sheer unadulterated greed. So greedy that dumbfuck retail caught them with their dick in the cookie jar. So bad that  the clearing houses / dtc didn’t want to pay for the gargantuan bags that were being held by the shorts. Because they’d have to. Someone had to pay and the shorts were, well, poetically the shorts were going to be short... A few billion dollars.   So it turns out all you have to do to avoid being molested by the squeeze of the century is change the rules, very clearly manipulate the stocks price, and suddenly squeezeageddon is a little gentle hug.  If this doesn’t show just how rigged the markets are, I don’t know what else could. Maybe a news story coming out that the DTC and large firms have a daily morning zoom call to literally decide what every single stocks opening and closing price will be every day, and then phone Cramer so he can say the opposite on CNBC.   Everything else since the great buying lockdown is small fry fuckery. Remember this.  But here’s the other thing. You think the boys at the funds hoarding short positions like they’re some kind of short dragon of Wall Street  are going just go “well that was close, let’s close all our GME shorts now while we can?” No fucking way. I guaranfuckingtee they’re doubling down. They think GME is worth $0. They aren’t to stop until they’re right. Specially when they’re playing against “dumbfuck” retail and the investor known as Reddit.   GME ain’t done yet.   Hold.        .
A good value w/ div all while screwing the massive shorts! $RYCEY
You might need to be patient but I feel this is one of the safer plays mentioned here. It's currently just riding above the $  support. Yes they had a hard year  last year as well as about every other aviation related company. The vaccine is slowly being deployed and airline traffic is already up substantially since mid-year.  Not too long ago Rolls Royce announced that it acquired the company Servowatch Systems with the aim of entering the ship automation industry. It is a significant development and one that will pay dividends long term. They also have recently partnered with Infosys a global leader in next-generation digital services and consulting. This will be used in their upcoming movement towards ship automation. This adds to the deals with the UK space energy and Virgin Galactic. Big success is around the corner.  Further, the company continues to expect to turn cash flow positive at some point during second quarter fiscal 2021, target at least 750 million free cash flow as early as 2022 and at least 2 billion pounds from disposal proceeds. In the 11-month period to ending November, large engine LTSA invoiced flying hours or EFH were approximately 42% of their prior year level. In October and November combined, EFH increased to approximately 33% compared to 2019. In the third quarter, EFH were 29% of the prior year, an improvement versus the 24% seen in Q2.  Not even mentioning 16,000 military engines with 160 customers in 103 different countries (war is always inevitable). Mix that with the fact that Brexit is official and you have a company that is desperately needed and will surely be the benefactor of a sweetheart deal by the government.     I'm adding this because a post I saw earlier that I agree with very much, the shorts are absolutely trashing RYCEY and this company deserves to get back to normal. Their debt issues could be helped if we help them by screwing the shorts. The short $ is insane and they need to learn another lesson.  The ceiling is so much higher than the floor in this situation. Here is just added info for those who want it.

Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should
When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.  The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. "Smart" bets where the house edge was only  , all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).  The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.  I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say "I just taught you a very valuable lesson." He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.  What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells "7 out!" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.  Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. "Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k." I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.  Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.  The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are "due". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.  The people saying "If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.  Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying "tomorrow is the day." Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.  Edit: Screenshots from the worst 40 minutes of my financial life    Edit 2: JFC, some of you are takin WSB way too seriously. You should not be using reddit for DD. Also, this is not financial advice. Don't take financial advice from someone who tells you stories about chasing highs at casinos.  Edit 3: This is WSB, my dudes. I'm glad most of you were entertained by my story. For the few of you who got that worked up by a random stranger on the internet telling you that he's a degenerate, you may actually have a problem.
($HUYA, $SKLZ) Flashing DD - Sleeping E-Sports Streaming Giant - 20 Day SMA Ground Floor
What is $HUYA?       Your mother, grandmother, auntie, and your wife's girlfriend know all about online games and esports streaming. Why not you? Stop working your right hand to your sister's onlyfans and put on your big boy pants for some solid DD. Stop getting off topic. No we're not talking about your lack of cunnilingus SKLZ exacerbating your wife's lesbian adventures. We're talking about Huya, your new Asian sugar momma who just wants to talk to your meat.     What is HUYA?  HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People’s Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.       With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).   Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.   31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.   News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The   drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on   valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the   valuation.

Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The   drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors.

Value / Earnings Play $BIO
Disclaimer: I found about this stock today using Td stock scanner, I hold no positions in this yet. I am not a financial adviser, I'm a college student that FOMOs into plays. I simply like the stonk.  # What is $BIO?  Marketcap:       Price:    Average Analyst Target Price (yahoo finance):           They have basically two segments. The first is research oriented providing reagents, apparatus, instruments and other stuff to organizations that do science (  government agencies, pharmaceuticals, biotech, universities and medical schools and many other labs.) 🧪🧪  Second segment is their Clinical Diagnostics segment are test systems, informatics systems, and test kits. 🔬🔬  # You: Okay another COVID testing company what's so special?  Check this, the P/E (TTM) is fucking   for a bio company.  # Boooo Boomer P/E discount strategy!!! 👴👴  Stfu, have you seen "strong earnings growth of      " (       since last quarter? JESUS. And it has earnings coming in   3 days.       # Are they making good money?  EPS (TTM) is  , it's actually earning A LOT OF money compared to GME (GUH). I found this stock filtering for high earning companies because of my GME shares lol.  # How do they fare against all the other bio testing stonks?  Let's see how many PCR machines they sell compared to others. IMO, it further highlights how absurdly discounted Bio-Rad is compared to other suppliers.     # So is Bio-rad actually selling equipment??  Let's ask the scientists.  A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.  >Three suppliers dominate the citations. They are Thermo Fisher,   Bio-Rad   (including brand MJ Research)    and Roche. The most cited models are Thermo Fisher 7x000 series, iCycler/MyIQ from   Bio-Rad     , and LightCycler from Roche.  Scientists seem to love their bio-rads dude, so even if COVID testing goes away, sciencey lab big brains will still buy bio-rad products.     # Technical Analysis🖍️🖍️:           # TLDR; $BIO ~~is~~ was very undervalued compared to other COVID testing stocks and produces good lab equipment even for a post COVID age. MMM estimates plus/minus   move based on options pricing.
Can someone explain why some people are still saying GME didn't have a short squeeze yet?
It seems to be the general consensus that somehow the short squeeze hasn't happened on GME yet, so somebody please explain, how a 2000% surge in price in a matter of days isn't a short squeeze? Seems like people are still waiting for the squeeze to happen as religiously as some people are waiting for Jesus to come save us all, and honestly, I think both events have about the same probability of happening.  EDIT: Am actually interested in hearing the DD showing it will surge, from what I heard the contracts expired on Friday, so I am wondering if there is something I am missing...
Filter shit posters. Look at how long they’ve been on Reddit.
There are legitimate concerns circulating about wall streeters spreading misinformation. Before you get your hopes up, or have an answer that seems promising. Just double check the account. Look at the history and awards for relevant posts. Don’t let them play our system for one moment, and don’t trust the mods to filter for us.   This is called social DD. Sucks that we have to do it, but we need to make it standard policy at this point.
Why Altria ($MO) LEAPs may have HUGE asymmetric upside
TL;DR: vaping, marijuana, Michael Burry, low as fuck IV, hugely under-valued company              \ Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\          Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\ . Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.   By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\ . Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.  We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body.   were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\   Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.  No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a   CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\ , and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.  These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\ , causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.  Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.    I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.    My thesis relies on four key beliefs:    ;#x200B;  1. The company's core business is under-valued 2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes 3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized 4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO    1) The Company's core business is under-valued    Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of   and a stunningly high dividend yield of   [\ . These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.  There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing "on!" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.  We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.    2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes     \ Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\    Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha,  ,  , director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping “there’s almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.” [\   Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\ . JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.  The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\ . This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:  1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL  This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.  2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL  In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.  Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\ . This is a "heat not burn" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.    3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized    Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\ .    4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO    Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\ . For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.  If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.    Summary    In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.  IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $  If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a  ;gt;3,100% return.  For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.
When did this sub become GameStopBets?
I used to go to this subreddit in order to view loss porn, read about alternative investment strategies, and laugh at people with less money than myself manage to lose all of it in a repetitive cycle. But lately I’ve noticed this sub only talks about GME. Will it ever stop?   Let’s face it, GME isn’t going to the moon anytime soon. The short sellers and market makers can replicate as many share IOUs as they want to keep up with any retail buyer demand. And since the stock isn’t paying dividends, and the company’s revenue is going down the toilet, there’s really no big downside to them doing so. Maybe Ryan Cohen could turn around the company someday, but that could take years.  Anyways I’d like to see this sub return to its roots. Ban all the newcomers especially people who only talk about GME. Anyone else agree? There’s more stocks to invest in than GME, many of them more promising and with higher upside.  Edit: mostly long boomer investing, VTI, VYM, VUG with a $  portfolio. Cashflow and EPS growth instead of speculation
QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.
A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.  So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.  Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.  You know why they make this comparison?  Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.  The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.  So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.  There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.  THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.  We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.  Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.  Which we do.  Making my rights negotiable (for a price).  Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?  It's not my fault, actually.   They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.  So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like – you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.  By all means go ahead and deride – but make it sensible.
There’s a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)
Hello all,  So reading the GME thread there’s a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the   ’s. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have.   I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong.   13G filings -  So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean?   I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren’t buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay “inflated” prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.    I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let’s say it’s 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure.   If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn’t done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles.   This is why ETFs don’t go parabolic and are considered “safe” they hedge and manage risk.   Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change.   Shares available to borrow-  As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that’s because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it’s raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there’s more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it’s moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low.   The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions.    Current SI -  I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high.   BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain.   December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn’t believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts.   The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn’t trigger this thing alone. We don’t have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren’t nearly this big and most not even active!   There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt.   Is this over? -   Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I’m rooting for y’all but mechanically it’s a lot harder to trigger.   This isn’t financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.
XL about to do the golden cross thingy
Anyone else been building a position in XL ? I started after the citron pump once it bottomed out around $  now I’m 1250 shares deep with a $  average and wondering if anyone else has this on there watchlist, MCAD seems about ready to cross over sometime this week.

GME Documentary - The story so far.
We don't actually KNOW whether or not "the rules were changed" to screw over retail investors
Obviously a real (not a bullshit quick glance) investigation needs to be done to find out exactly what went on, but, based on the information that has been provided so far, no "rules" were changed:  \- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this "rule" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.  \- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this "rule" was already in place as well.  Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called "commissions".  Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:  \- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k  \- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin  \- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.  Is it really that hard to believe a brokerage with this kind of history simply fucked up, and Vlad didn't want to admit to it on tv?
Opinions on $AFRM?
I know this isn’t a popular topic here. No, I’m not a bot nor am I trying to shill. Yes, I’m still bag-holding that load of GME (trying to recover from losses). Please don’t delete, mods!  Anyway, AFRM recently went public. It’s part of the “PayPal mafia”. I feel like the current price ($120ish) is quite high but I’m relatively new, so what do I know. Does anyone have any information or idea where this could be headed? I see potential and their earnings report is coming out soon.   Also, sorry if my flair is wrong. First time posting!    TLDR; What are your opinions on AFRM? Recently went public.
Why is no one talking $BMBL IPO this week. (Bumble Dating)?
$BMBL IPO, I like this stock.       What I like:    A pure services play.  No inventory, no product.   One of the premier dating sites growing in popularity.  Liked by men and women.   COVID vaccines are being distributed and the worst of the pandemic should be behind us.   While other competitors seem to be playing a price and "free" game, Bumble seems to be going the quality route.   Solid revenue and growth  What I don't like:    Facebook dating is in development and being tested - poses a huge threat   Many competitors in the space
VANGUARD SENT LETTERS TO MY HOUSE AND MY MOM FOUND THEM
Holy shit. I don't even know what to do at this point. I started up an account with them on the 1st and put in 90 bucks, I didn't even trade any stocks yet, I was still researching them. I pussied out with GME and AMC so that money's just been sitting there. But they sent to my house three whole letters with my legal name right on them for her to find. She made me open them up and let her read them. I'm so fucked. If she finds out I've been trading on Coinbase I'm gonna be beaten. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm getting a real job asap and moving out of this fucking dump.
The Legend of $GME
Robinhood ads and other questions
Hello Ape boys:  Since seeing the GME thing build up through the front page, I've been following your mission and for the last couple of weeks noticed Robinhood ads popping up and usually with a large number of awards attached.   1) is just browsing your posts really enough to get targeted?  2) who do they think they're trying to fool?  3) is it just me or did these ads appear around the same time the class action was submitted (and is there any news on that)?  ...  Thank you all for the quarantine entertainment.
My best GME gain porn. $1,295 --> $959,663 in just over 3 weeks. Sold because of brokers blocking buy orders. Sorry
You Were Always Going to be Holding the Bags
GME buyers were given two amazing gifts.  The first was a squeeze that made the stock rocket in price thousands of percent in a week or two, and the second was a loud PSA telling you when the peak was in, so you could sell at the best price.  I realize if the brokers hadn't restricted buying, the stock could have went much higher, but when they announced no more buying(only selling), even an idiot would know the price can only go in one direction after that.  And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.  We've all held the bags from time to time, and it sucks, but some of you all are blaming everything and everyone but yourselves.  Oh and the people being critical of you trying to pump GME a second time, the ones you call shills?  Those are usually WSB vets.  The ones telling you to diamond hand, and to buy more, you'll notice that those are the new members, those are the shills.  They desperately want you to pump so they can unload those bags on to you.
EWJ breaking out
Started following this because Burry tweeted something about Topix possibly breaking the "iron coffin lid." He is pretty heavy in Japanese industrials so take that with a grain of salt. Anyway, he included the following link       along with a snapshot of a particular stock which someone identified to be Murakami Corp, 7292 JP, which appeared typically undervalued compared to its assets. His inference seemed to be that undervalued Japanese stocks may be about to go gangbusters.     With my broker, WeBull, I dont have much exposure to Japan, so I started following EWJ. Anyhow, the chart is starting to look pretty interesting. Last week it moved big and this morning it sent a little doji up.     EDIT: HERE IS A TWEET WITH A  SCREENSHOT OF THE ORIGINAL BURRY TWEET

How to buy GME shares for 25% off: The Most Retarded GME Play in the History Of The Universe
So, I am way to fond of my wife's boyfriend to do this...  But I am SO tempted to buy 1000 GME shares at $60, and then sell 10 covered calls for Feb 26th with a $60 strike price and $15 premium.  And then roll the fucking options premium back into more shares, and then sell more covered calls.   Yes, this is a retarded play, don't do this, this is not advice. It is just a commentary on how messed up the options are in GME right now.  Yes, I know this will result in the MM selling synthetic longs on the market, thereby driving the price down...   Which is the craziest point! Because there are more shares now, the calls go down in value!   So you buy them back, and do the whole thing again!   .....   Look, I know this is stupid, and I know it won't really work. But I thought I would share some legit retarded idea, that only exists because of monkey business in the market.
HIMX - the tendies were nice today (February 8, 2021)...

WSB Making Waves in the Media 👑👑👑
"One thing we learned from our communities last week is that underdogs can accomplish just about anything when they come together around a common idea," reads an excerpt of the Reddit message. "Who knows, maybe you'll be the reason finance textbooks have to add a chapter on 'tendies.' "
(CLNE) DD. The path of least resistance, and most gains.
Alright retards, it's time to get into the next biggest movement in our lifetime and make some no brainer tendies, Clean Energy. (CLNE)          This is not financial advice, do your own DD before investing. Yada yada.   I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.    Clean Energy Fuels Corp   is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America.   As of right now they are currently involved in:    Regional Fleets of Trucks    Commercial Airlines    Public Transit    Construction Vehicles    Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines    Argument #1    Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year.          Financials      Market Cap -      P/E Ratio -       Cash on Hand - 96 million  What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.        Argument #2    Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read   you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now     TLDR:   Biden will make   far reaching   investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.  While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.    Clean Energy Fuels Corp   is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.    Argument #3    The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.  The   owns   of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately   million shares. He definitely believes in the company!    My Price Targets    I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with    The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for  MANY  more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.    Yes I bought at the top, today. I'm sure this is only the beginning. I will add more to my positions later to average down and add some leaps as well.    TLDR   CLNE is the future. Expect a 400% increase over the next 6 to 12 months.
The #1 online casino company $RSI is primed for autism
Positions: $RSI 30 03/19 30C  Proof:       \ This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\      TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.     \ \ Overview\ \   "Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies     Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the   online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.  The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.  $RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.  Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia (  and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.     \ \ The Financials and Strategy\ \   Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $  Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.  Paired with this blow out will be a \ \ guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\ \ , which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.        What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.        Their focus on attracting \ \ female gamers\ \  is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \ \ This cannot be understated\ \  as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.        As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.        \ \ Short sellers have entered the chat\ \   The short interest on $RSI sits at   M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at   Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.     \ \ Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\ \   On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.     \ \ Institutions are bullish\ \   Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today:    Alliance Bernstein holds a 6% position reported today:       \ \ Final notes\ \   Jerome " " Bettis, Steelers legend and hall of fame running back, is their brand ambassador... This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.  This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \ \ management owns 77% of the company\ \ . This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.     I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.     Do your own research.

Hey Robinhood! How ‘bout you let us sell fractional shares for the retards who switched to a different broker
I finally dropped RH last week and wouldn’t ya know it, RH still wants to fuck you over.  You cunts won’t let me sell the .9 GME because it’s a fractional and you won’t transfer it because it’s a fractional.  I also can’t sell it at all because my account is deactivated. “but retard, sell it as cash” You’re not listening or reading you dumb ape.  Account deactivated. No selling. “Submit a request you retard” Yup.  And wait 3 days to be informed I have to reactivate my account, transfer funds to make it a full share, sell that share, move the cash back to my bank, then close my account.  FFS.
BioNano Genomics - Why you should care about it
First of all, I'm not a financial advisor and I like certain stocks more than others.  I was skeptical about investing in   after the run-up which saw that share price move from   $  to $10 in two months  . But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.  Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.  I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:     That story is from their  . There are many others.  Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:     There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.  Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested:  .     I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too. I'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.  Thanks and good luck to us all!
Palantir: My   to Bears, Bulls with 0 Hope, Myopic Analysts, Cramer, and Big Daddy Institutions
The amount of heresy being preached about Palantir really is a sight to behold huh.   $30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on  , and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!?   And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?  Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?  A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, "it didn't hit $40, fml". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.  To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock.   is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst   YOU GET SCREWED  . This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!  Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped. Palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. Short Volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. MM can hold us down for only so long. It's a stock that has 2 more   Major Catalysts   to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. The gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.  PS: Fuck   Jim "Once a Shill Always a Shill" Cramer  . That Indecisive, Bi-Polar Clown.   PPS: Drop a heart for Mommy Cathie. This women lead me to the promise lands with my poor $800 acc (17 btw) and helped turn it into $2k plus  Thank you :)
Since Td Ameritrade is owned by Charles Schwabb would it make sense to open a fidelity account for short term trades instead If I already have a Charles Schwabb account for Long
Would you guys think it's a good idea to go with TD Ameritrade or Fidelity seeing as I already am holding long shares in my Schwabb account?  Only reason I am asking is bc CS owns TD Ameritrade and I don't know if that could cause any issues in the future (reeling from my Robinhood Burn, hence my concern)  But from what I have seen the Think or Swim app seems really good while I don't know much about Fidelity other than they are both the Top 3 of recommended trading platforms. Any advice would be appreciated!  Thanks guys!

The Solution to the Robinhood Problem
Okay Smoothie Brains, I’ll make this short because I know you apes won’t read.  Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn’t keep up.  Something like that, I don’t really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears.   Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (  stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.  This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don’t have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.  Identify and invest in early players That’s what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can’t make promises because I an amateur and I’m not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I’m just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.  TL/DR: Understand how digital securities are going to change the securities markets.
Not stonks but also want equivalently
Minded stonk boyfriend wanted, bc I just was dating a dude who shorted tesla for this week, and what did he do? Punch me in the eye. So much for liberals being gentle. Send all applications to idk I feel dead inside. That picture is me however I change my hair color constantly, I am bleach blonde now to show that I’m slightly mentally ill. I’m mostly straight.

How many of you have moved out of Robinhood and how many of you plan to do so in recent future?
I did my research to find an alternative to Robinhood in light of recent events and finally initiated the full transfer of my Robinhood account to  Fidelity. Their website and app seems very information dense and not as easy to use as Robinhood but I am willing to learn and am never going to get back to Robinhood. F\ \ k Robinhood.  Anyway, I was just curious if I was the only one moving out of Robinhood or are there other folks here doing the same. If you are moving out, what did you pick as an alternative to Robinhood, and why? I think your experience will probably help others decide where they want to move. Thanks.
Weekly Earning Bingo Card
Ok so with my current investing app I can do 4 day trades before I get a warning.  So looking at next weeks upcoming earnings I decided to make a bingo board of it and plan out my day trades accordingly.  On Monday I will YEET all of my money into CVS expecting a good earnings on Tuesday morning  From there I’ll sell off and put it all into Shopify for Wednesday’s earnings After that I’ve got Walmart and then halfway through the day liquidate and move into Roku and see where I end up come Friday :)   Disclaimer: I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing and I’m only here because I can’t gamble on Pokémon pack openings since scalpers made my hobby a hellscape where just a sniff of SWSH base set is a Savannah amongst this desert hell.
I have the feeling GME is getting hotter and hotter, I'd like to burn my ass on it. And YES, it is possible   motivational speech
WE KNOW WE CAN GO TO THE MOON AND WE WILL GO TO THE FUCKING MOON  I missed the first wave of GME, but thats not a big deal for me 'cause I know there will be a second chance.  We aren't done yet with the fcking hedge funds. They know we are to be taken seriously.  Just like WE know that a second attack is possible. But that's only possible if we are convinced.       !! I mean why should we be afraid? The short positions are STILL there. Same scenario as a few weeks ago but this time with an advantage: we know we can do it and we are able to do it again !!  \- But this time there is no Robinhood fcking with us     Let's help the little man ride the wave!!   no financial advice i just like beans and glurak
Weed stocks are NOT like GME.
Someone needed to say this.  There is tons of DD on APHA and TLRY running around reddit, and I trust that you can find it yourselves. There are also  signs from US politics regarding the upcoming and probable legalization of cannabis. In my opinion, there are some extremely smart ways to invest in the cannabis sector that is projected to grow over the next months/years.  That being said, I am incredibly frustrated that these companies are now seen as pump and dump schemes. I have held positions in both APHA and TLRY for over a month, and I plan on continuing to hold them long-term because I believe in their fundamentals as a company and the expansion of marijuana legalization. PLEASE could everyone stop saying things like "weed is dead" and "I just YOLO'd on weed and sold at the top before it crashed to get my sweet gainz."  For any seasoned investor, cannabis is a good long-term play right now, and all these meme stock/hypers are giving it a bad name. Leave it alone! Personally, if I were down on these stocks, I would absolutely hold onto them because they have solid potential.  These are not short squeeze/hype/meme stocks. Please stop looking at them as such.
No interest on debt and buy stocks? Life is a joke
Ok hear me out  Can I vent   I recently learned I violated a rule here that I blew money I could afford to Loose!  I did all last year.  I was married for 10 years. Got into stock investing in 2018.  Business owner in California since 2016.   Business was doing good 180k latest gross month and started investing with robinhood only 1k then.   2016 I rented a house for 4k 6 bedroom in Los Angeles.  Once separated I became homeless while my wife took my 5 kids to nyc in May 2019. I was sending her roughly 3k and assuredly she was fucking a boyfriend.   She returned and I got her and my kids a house and moved out of air bnb to stay in the house with my gf and now my soon to be x is gay. So I’m staying there with her, her gf, me and my gf. This shit was dumb as hell.   I run a ac business that I destroyed during my separation. 2 mil in sales for 3 years that now I’m lucky if I do 200k a year now.   2019 when I thought trading wasn’t for me because I had already lost 5k in options between Webull and rh I blew 10k in the strip club and missed a very bullish market.  May 2020 after getting kicked out the house I got with my x so that her gf could pay the bills I was homeless again staying in hotels and air bnb. I ran ads for my business for ac repair and hustled up 15k and used 10k for rh and Webull again.  I decided to renter the market and off I went with options   Aapl tsla Ford American Airlines Macy’s etc   Made money lost money   Total up my losses for 2020 is 20k.  I knew I would be ok because I had my dad insurance money because he past to back me up for getting me a place. I received secured a place and stay in Hollywood ca   Have my kids 2 weeks out month and required to pay 2500 monthly child support   Busienss sucks these days I used business profits to pay bills and of course gamble.  I’m in 2021 been getting eviction notices since December but finally learned that in ca since September you only required to pay 25% of rent until July 2021 and the debt is interest free to pay back to landlord.   I paid rent in full 2300 since September until December which is almost 10k and the requirement is 2500 roughly. I’m learning that I’m paid up quite well.  I’ve bitten the bullet that my company is down and taken a sales job for peddling hvac systems.   I’m pretty good at what I do.   I called tlry week before it rose and people said I was wrong. Check post for me I was fb aapl and tsla fan boy before it popped.   I’m going to beat this system and yolo the fuck out of my commission checks.   I will keep this community updated with full transparency as I promise to be dropping 2k in options as often as possible.   I’m expecting to make with this job 10-20k a month because of my experience and commission.   2020 I paid college Tuition to learn these markets.  I like stocks and I lost money on my own accord.  I shared this for those that like long fucking life stories and to remind you to look into new regulations for rent and mortgage payments.  Time to leverage this debt and yolo.   Positions now is ddd and Kroger’s   I’ve got a whole list!!!!
Puts on everything
A bit of a rant here. While I hate to pile on to the negative sentiment floating around here, and at the risk of sounding like a   , PUTS. ON. EVERYTHING. Let’s look at the facts  No trading on Monday so on Tuesday the volume is going to go to shit like every shorty week. Tuesday is also going to have a 🍆 load of bad earnings. Most notably the in the housing sector (no supply) , retail, and Vegas stocks (the recovery is not   up as fast as everyone anticipated). But Tuesday is going to look like a jpow brand printer compared to Wednesday.   Wednesday’s earnings bring us pharma and oil. Two sectors that combined may actually make for a neutral day if the market can look past them. But if they don’t it will be because they realize oil prices are going to top soon because the jabiden knows the saudis better than the last admin and they WILL increase supply if prices get too out of hand. And pharma earnings will definitely beat but not by enough to give the people confidence enough that the recovery is going smoothly. And that brings to the worst day of the week. The crescendo to the madness. Thursday.  This is not news but our fearless leaders are putting all eyes on us Thursday. It’s been an honor serving with you autists. I’ll remember our time fondly. For those who are extra retarded, Citadel’s Ken Griffin, Robinhood’s Vlad Tenev, Melvin Capital Management chief Gabriel Plotkin, Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman, and Keith Gill, DFV himself, the artist formerly known as roaring kitty. A man I would be proud to call my wife’s boyfriend are all scheduled to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday, and they are going to throw our asses right under the bus! Here’s a quote from the vicious snake Maxine waters that called our hero to congress.   “Addressing that predatory and manipulative conduct is the responsibility of lawmakers and securities regulators who are charged with protecting investors and ensuring that our capital markets are fair, orderly, and efficient,”  You read that correctly smooth brains. We are helpless creatures that need protecting and they will trot out DFV to try and prove it. Personally I think DFV is a smart guy and I encourage everyone to watch his initial game stop thesis on the roaring kitty YouTube page. You don’t even have to read. But clearly congress thinks he is a pump and dump master that harnessed the power of the most chaotic sub on the internet. Don’t be surprised when Melvin capital is not made out to be the bad guy in this scenario. But once the rage subsided and you take a closer look they definitely want to regulate us. Can you blame them? We’re unruly degenerates that run up companies just for memes and loss porn.  That cannot and will not stand. That means goodbye commission free trading. Stricter options rules or doing away with them on order flow platforms all together. Maybe they go a little crazy and put higher taxes on short term capital. Either way this the apocalypse, and I don’t think that’s the least bit over exaggerating. The big guys know that won’t sit well with us and they will start turning cash gang in seconds. The negative reaction will compound into more negative reaction,    on here will buy tons of puts further extending the negative sentiment until we spiral down to hell. The rivers will turn to blood. Fire will rain down from the sky. A plague of locusts cover the lands. Jabiden will accidentally nuke China. And Warner brothers will do a remake of nothin but trouble. The sell off will keep going till the end of AH and leave everyone wondering what could possibly happen tomorrow.   Friday is not news just more selling. With a side of selling. And a selling chaser. We will go back to doing SPY weeklys rebuild this world.   TLDR: PUTS ON EVERYTHING!!!!!!!  Edit: pos are 3/19 $306 put. 3/19 $386 put.

If both the stock and 'co in' market does not crash next week I will eat whatever is the top comment here and video record it
I am relatively confident on my thesis on why and what is going to happen next week. TLDR market go up because you press buy but now market go down because they say bye. So while the retail boys are busy buying the hedgies have long being getting out. TSLA is going to be pretty interesting to look at. I wish i was smart enough to realise this when it actually mattered. proof will happen no bans thanks. Im willing to share my ideas if you want but I mean the most basic thing you can do is look at the RSI.   Not financial advise   Edit: Should make it double or nothing, what if the top commentor has to do what they dare me to do if i am right, stonks only go up right?'  edit 2: The 'co_in' market is something you all know too i dont know if this post will get removed if i write the words
NOT EVERY PLAY IS A SHORT SQUEEZE PLAY        🌕🌕
Every day the same fucking thing since GME. Every penny stock with a BS DD talking about how this is a "short play" or we are going to eviscerate the short investors and moon.  Even a retard like me know how fucking stupid the reason is. Let's see, you buy a stock, other people start buying, the interest on the short position goes up, the short investor needs to cover his position, and he is desperate to pay any price because he is so heavily reverse-invested in the stock. That's the gist of a short squeeze retards.  If you are buying a no-name stock, you don't know the ratio of short against the outstanding stock and a ton of other factors you don't have an idea how to google, you don't get to squeeze the short investor. The short investor will just see a temporary bump and that's all. DFV is a professional finance guy with a CFA and with the appropriate of autism to make him successful, you are investing based on the word "short squeeze" and just downloaded Robinhood last week and the only dime you made from that when someone clicked on the referral link you posted on facebook.  Your main goal is to find a heavily shorted stock first and somehow keep raising its price. But that requires quite some effort, charisma and retard luck to do that. And let's not forget nobody here knows why the heck the stock price actually rises, yet we assume the SEC, the stock exchange and every in the Wallstreet is corrupt! But somehow posting emojis will raise the price.  Disclaimer:  I have put the obligatory emojis so that retarded analyst using the reddit API can find this post and try to make sense using efficient market hypothesis, black and Scholes or whatever the fuck they learned in business school because they weren't smart enough to become an engineer.  Not your financial advisor, make your own decision yourselves I could be working for big government, Soros or the Koch for all you care
The stock market is a pendulum
Quite a few of you smooth brained chimps seem to have forgotten the FIRST core principle of investing successfully.  As Benjamin Graham said: "The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists."  Meme stock = unsustainable optimism  Shorting every meme stock on this subreddit is a legit strategy imo.
one year ago today i started investing in stocks, happy to say i’ve made a 102% return as of today, hopefully i can pull this off every year i’ll be rich!!
[GME] Volume vs Price Linear Regression Analysis. A comparison with AMC + Others
Hey everyone,  I'll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I'll also say I'm NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I've taken Finance courses in college, but that's it.   In any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so.  . The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock's page. The tickers I chose are:    AMC   ATVI   GM   GME   JPM   SNDL   SNOW   TSLA   UPS   V   The criteria was just "fairly popular stocks", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you'd want to see, feel free to comment.   I left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.   What I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a "sign" of anything. So I'm leaving it up to you apes.  . You'll notice that the R 2 for GME is off the charts, at   The second highest is TSLA, with  , followed by UPS, at     Here's a general definition of R 2 :  >R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.  Here are the R 2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):    AMC:     ATVI:     GM:     GME:     JPM:     SNDL:     SNOW:     TSLA:     UPS:     V:     I believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can't help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I've made some ground-breaking discovery, I'm looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current "reasoning" for holding is that there's a lot of "weird" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as "maybe it's this, maybe it's that". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife's bf calls you).  PS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the   size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.  #####EDIT: If anyone knows a safe,   anonymous  , way of sharing this data, I'm happy to post it
Puts on PZZA, Papa John himself hates it, has received an artificial bump from pandemic/super bowl
So this is completely retarded advice but I'm usually always right on my long term plays, I'm a poor so I don't usually gamble, but I've lurked here for years.  Now I've been an off-an-on customer of Papa John's for years and actually enjoyed their food but I don't think anyone can deny that the overall quality has been going down since big Papa was forced to step down.      .  This is a company with a margin of 3% (Domino's has >10% margins), living under the brand name of someone they don't support anymore, serving worse and worse pizza.  They never have good deals, they are more expensive, declining quality, yet can't make a good healthy profit margin? What is going on in this dumpster fire of a company?  We are currently sitting at an all-time high, with low volume, and puts are cheap.  This is basically free money right?    edit:   I don't currently have any position yet but I'm going to closely follow this shit tomorrow and price in some puts, maybe wait for earnings like someone else suggested to see if it goes any higher (that'd be nice).
WSB: GME Infinity War
TLRY is next GME! History will repeat it hit $300 in 2018 when cannabis wasn't even close to being legal in the US!!!
War! Huh! Yeah! What is it good for?
Know what you are buying: The asset or a CFD (GME, BB, AMC etc.)
This is just a PSA to say you should know what you are buying. a CFD (contract for difference) is not the actual stock or contract. Thus if you buy a CFD you are not impacting any supply and demand situation in the market. you are in effect just placing a bet on which way the price will go. There are many so called brokers and apps that only sell CFDs such as eToro etc.  If you buy a CFD from, say, eToro or equivalent you will not impact any short squeeze scenario since the actual asset (share) is not owned by you and where applicable you will not be entitled to any share dividends either.   If you want to help impact the market please ensure you are actually buying the stock you are bidding for. CFDs are just a form of spread betting.  All that said, I am not an accountant, I don't have an OF page, I eat bananas and lick windows, this is not financial advice!
$DIS is the way.
I'll keep this short and simple since I know most of you can't read.  Disney+ is a money printing machine.  Disney has proven they can succeed in the digital streaming marketplace.  Their acquisition of BAM video and poaching of Netflix employees has paid off in a big way, with beautiful integration of their offerings into the Disney+ platform.  If you don't have Disney+ or have never tried it, I recommend you trial it to see what I'm talking about.   Disney's massive intellectual property portfolio will continue to drive subscriber growth exponentially.  They expect 230-260 million subscribers by FY 2024.  But what about the theme parks?  The theme parks are an added bonus at this point.  They are primarily a media behemoth and will continue printing off their digital content which make money machine go BRRR.  I recommend accumulating shares for long term holding and buying LEAP calls with far out expirations.

GEVO is a great company with lots of upside potential
GEVO's co-CEO just won the nobel price in chemistry and guess what, she's also on Biden's science advisory board \[1\]\[2\]. Now what are they actually doing? They're making jet fuel from plants. Jet fuel! Do you realize, this is the only available way to make planes "clean" in the foreseeable future? This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes. And it gets even better. They hold a patent on this tech, so only they can do it \[3\].  GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years. Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden.  Also I should mention that you're basically helping the environment by investing in this. You'll make it easier for the company to raise cash and be successful.

Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market'
Reddit said Monday it raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from both existing and new investors.  What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.  Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'  'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.  Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.   'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.  Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.   Source    This means buy amc and GME obviously tho  I am ape you do lookin make own choice 🐒
Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion)
I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.  I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss  Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.  Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.  Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. "Diamond Hands" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.  The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as "weak hands" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.  Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.  Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.  Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.    \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need  Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.  Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.  Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.  Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into "Sectors" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the "Greeks" are. That will teach you how options function.     If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.  Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.  May the gains be with you
Sad reality of a teenager mislead by the notion of “democratize finance”
Vaccine stonks a good investment now that it's confirmed we'll be getting booster shots every few years?
Hear me out. What are your thoughts for the boomer stonk moderna? It's now clear we'll need booster shots for potentially forever so they'll have a new constant stream of buyers, as long as a better vaccine isn't released... They've been bleeding financially year after year but once this company starts to turn a profit (after streamlining etc. now that the trial phase is out of the way) all the boomers are gonna get mega huge boners for it again. Revenue is increasing fast, but maybe not fast enough to meet expectations at the end of the month.   I'm thinking wait until earnings drop, then buy some long term OTM calls. Or maybe I'm just retarded for ever thinking about this play.
Short $Ally - 11 Days out, 1000’s of customers still locked out of their accounts
Everyone is still talking about Robinhood but there are thousands of customers still locked out of their accounts on Ally invest, unable to even sell positions.  Holdings showed massively incorrect for many and hold times to speak with a rep are in excess of 4 hours if you can get through at all. They’re not going public with any news, or guidance and people are fleeing the platform as fast as they can.    Q1 earnings report is early April and I bet it will be ugly. Options are only trading in monthlies but the Jun 2021 puts are looking like a super cheap gamble right now.  Tell me why I’m wrong.  Edit(s):  Conversation on Down Detector:    Ally Care Twitter:    Trading Disabled Notification: This is a sell order, even under normal restrictions for free-riding, etc. they still allow you to close out positions, this is outright disabled to "Protect" ally, meanwhile they hide behind high volume.
Diamond hands, Diamond bags baby.
Would Robinhood have to buy stock for customers transferring to new broker?
Just curious about how brokers are impacted in this situation.   People here bought stock through Robinhood. RH lent those shares out to short sellers. When these stock owners transfer their stock to a new broker, does RH then have to cover that lent stock?  Was reading these two sites and it got me curious.        If RH has to cover those shares, I'm wondering if people migrating to other platforms force RH to either close out the short sale or buy more stock.  This stock situation is very strange and complicated.
CVS- 10% of Michael Burry's portfolio and why it is in mine
Smart Money makes you money.   This is not financial advice. DO your own DD.   Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there… eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.  The Stock I am talking about is CVS…   Well, I couldn’t believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS.   A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven’t done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.  \#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven’t. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn’t need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like “Oh wow, my wife’s boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring”.  So, increase in sales   \#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don’t believe in the F word.   · According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it’s fair value  · PE Ratio is   which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x  · Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions   · Long term Assets $  B vs $  Liabilities  · \ Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B  · Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic)   · Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (    · Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings   \#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive.

Really loved WSB; saw the trash of DD in the last 2 weeks and thought I’d try to begin a change back to the norm, but had to create an account.   To confirm I’m not a boomer- at the age of 10 I cried during the Pokémon movie when Ash Died.
$RYCEY
So I'm looking for y'all opinion on $RYCEY  I've done some research, and watched it trend. Personally I think it ultimately comes down  to their future in the aerospace industry. Currently I think they are undervalued because of efficiency issues with engines for the f-130.    but at the end of the day they're still an engineering company that has a history of getting it right in the long term, so I see this play as a mid to long term and getting out around $6-$7.  Thoughts
Can we just have a GME BB AMC megathread
I understand, fuck Melvin, fuck the hedges, fuck some brokers. I’m retarded too, that’s why I do my research on here. I’m missing on serious gains because it’s almost impossible to do research in here now. Every 5 minutes it’s just another GME post. 8 million people and none of them know what the fuck they’re doing, convince them to dump their money right? This sub has gone from YOLOing everything you have into GOEV and losing it, posting the loss porn, and taking your losses like a man to essentially an insider trading, mass manipulation mission where the retard levels get so dense it creates a black hole of autism that causes people to dump their grocery money on the early peak of a squeeze. This shit is killing people. I promise everyone that    🏽 GME isn’t going anywhere.    I could be in debt soon, so it has nothing to do with GME losses.
Noob Question -- but is everything published propaganda and bullshit?
Be gentle, I am a noob and truly stupid.  I did some research looking for a stock in alternative energy. I had no clue what I was doing.   I bought a small amount of a stock I liked. It jumped in three months. Currently double when I got in. I am happy.  I decided to dive in and look at the stock more closely to identify what was going on and maybe apply it to other stock picks.  I then read this pick was terrible, things like the company is "in dire straights", the stock is too "volatile", "over valued", etc. Everything I read is doom and gloom and my instincts are supposedly shit.  I can't even find consistent information about the company.   Is there any place to get reliable information I can trust that isn't blatant manipulation?  Thanks.
IT STILL ISNT OVER (Part 1/2) (The Notebook)
TDC - deeper DD as promised
TLDR  ; TDC is a better Snowflake worth $70 to $300.  It is not "the new Snowflake." Snowflake is like Goldilocks in this scenario - it quickly developed a cloud-based  product (within 2012-2014) and stole some business from   TDC is back with a superior cloud offering, and it's about to kick Goldilocks out of its house.    Investment Case    Teradata is a data warehousing business (almost exactly like Snowflake). They briefly lost the crown to Snowflake (innovator's dilemma) in 2014, when they failed to pivot to the   that has all changed as of a few days ago.  The company shocked investors last week by reporting a massively-successful new cloud biz (see last week's earnings release  . The company's CEO even suggests that   they are stealing business back from Snowflake  . TDC stock is worth $70 in the immediate near-term, possibly $150-300 if valued like Snowflake.    TDC is NOT an emerging disruptor  . This is an established, 40-year pioneer in data warehousing. These guys led the way for decades and are now deploying their already-developed, superior (more scalable) tech to the cloud to displace Snowflake and take back the crown.  Either Snowflake is not worth $90 billion, or Teradata is...       Overview    Teradata is an enterprise data warehousing business,   TDC enables customers/businesses to access/manage data, generate insights, and use these findings to make informed decisions.    Data Warehousing Industry / Tailwinds      Data warehousing is the process of capturing, storing, managing and analyzing data. Pretty catch-all phrase but this is a catch-all business, fam. It applies to literally everything.   Companies use data warehousing software to acquire, aggregate and integrate data from multiple sources (different geographies, business units, etc).   Analytical services are layered on to help businesses make informed, data-driven decisions   Total addressable market is $81 billion, according to Snowflake in 2020.      Snowflake’s S-1 filing: “  markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms and Business Intelligence and Analytics Tools, which we believe we address, will have a combined value of   $56 billion by the end of 2020 and $84 billion by the end of 2023.  ”      That’s an industry-wide CAGR of \~15%    Company History    TDC was a pioneer in data warehousing. The company launched in 1979 and developed a cutting edge relational database platform by 1984. TDC was acquired by AT&T (NCR) in the early 90’s, and created the world’s first 1TB database system for Walmart in 1992. In 1996, it spun off from AT&T in ‘96 as NCR Corp. TDC spun off from NCR in 2007 as an independent company and the largest standalone data warehousing biz. So 40+ years of experience in data warehousing.  Chief Technology Officer Stephen Brobst has been involved in some shape or form since the NCR days in the early 90's. He has been CTO since 1999. In 2014, Brobst was ranked the top 4th CTO in the US - yea up there with Tesla and Amazon CTO's ( . Brobst is clearly a visionary and top mind in the business.  TDC was historically focused on the legacy server construct. Back then, the thought of a utility-like public cloud (AWS) becoming the industry standard was laughable. Companies ran their own servers and relied on on-prem solutions. TDC deployed on-prem database software, servers, analytical software and related consulting services.  TDC was a well-known name in the business world; in 2008, customers included Coca-Cola, FedEx, Wells Fargo and a long list of other boomer stocks. Historically, IBM and Oracle were listed as top competitors. Pre 2014, Teradata was considered THE data warehousing leader (ahead of ORCL, IBM) by Gartner. Today, its cloud product is back at the top (yes, above Snowflake, see below).  Over the years TDC shifted focus from the legacy data warehousing business to upselling big data analytics and marketing solutions. This was the investment case in \~2013 when I pitched the stock to my college investment club (shoutout CIG). However, TDC’s legacy offering wasn’t well-suited for the cloud, which was starting to gain a lot of hype and traction. This rustled everyone’s jimmies and TDC started to collapse from 2012-2014, when Snowflake launched its cloud-based offering and started stealing market share. Emerging tech like Hadoop and Amazon’s AWS native offering (Redshift) were also major threats.  So there you have it, TDC was king of the “data warehousing” hill, failed to pivot to the cloud, lost to Snowflake and was in   now.    TDC today    Teradata has rebranded itself as a “hybrid cloud analytics software provider,” meaning it can run its database software (Teradata Vantage) on-prem, in the public cloud, private cloud or all of the above. Literally exactly what Snowflake does, perhaps even better (more on that later).  TDC was purpose-built for complex queries. The company spent the past 40+ years leading/ innovating and accumulating 600+ patents. This IP is the result of massive spending and effort over the years - the result was a company that eventually enjoyed 25% cash flow returns on capital before Snowflake went and punched them in the balls. Now TDC is coming back with a vengeance.  TDC Vantage is a fixed-cost, scalable software platform. The company is basically taking decades of research and refined technique, and migrating it to the cloud. R&D has already been spent and TDC claims to be multiple years ahead of Snowflake (see below). Now it just needs to move this IP to the cloud and print cash.  The company is now run by CEO Steve McMillan, who previously tried to compete against TDC at IBM (19 years) and   failed (his own admission, see article below). McMillan was brought in to turn the company around after it failed under previous leadership to pivot to the cloud. Now, he  is executing better than anyone expected.  Last week, TDC shocked investors when it broke out cloud-based annual recurring revenues (ARRs) of $100 million, up 160% from a year prior. This was the first mention of their success in the cloud and a surprise to longs and shorts alike.  In the most recent earnings call, sell-side analysts were glowing:  >"congrats on the strong execution" - Wamsi Mohan --  Bank of America . -- Analyst   >   >"congrats on a really strong quarter" - Katy Huberty --  Morgan Stanley -- Analyst    >   >"congrats on the great quarter" - Peabody --  Barclays  \-- Analyst   >   >"congrats on a really nice quarter. I think it seems like getting the right capital for the ship is getting it back on track, so congrats." - Zane Chrane --  Bernstein Research  \-- Analyst       Cloud Implications      Cloud-based subscriptions are cheap to deploy. They don’t involve massive up-front costs to acquire a perpetual license/on-prem deployment. For those that don't know, this is like subscribing to Netflix vs. buying movies yourself. the former is much cheaper up-front.   TDC users pay based on their computing needs, so revenues are NOT recognized ratably like other SaaS stocks. Revenues are recognized as customers compute, so revenue growth is directly tied to the volume of usage of the platform. This is a VERY attractive business model and effectively a toll bridge on cloud computing.   TDC’s legacy on-prem business   WAS   lumpy because of the large upfront cost, which resulted in long sales cycles and required executive/CEO-level approvals to complete a sale. New cloud-based offering is lower-cost up front and easier to sell. This will enable shorter sales cycles and faster growth.   Large scale data warehousing requires a lot of human touch/tailoring. TDC is very experienced in helping big businesses with these large database transitions. They have a solid consulting business purpose-built for this. These consultants didn’t get stupid overnight - TDC can leverage its years of experience to offer a more tailored experience vs. Snowflake, which has only been doing this for 6 years and doesn’t have a massive consulting effort.   While TDC has been in decline for years, it’s bled customers at a slower-than expected pace. This is because many TDC customers spent a shit load of money upfront to integrate their business data on TDC databases. These customers still fork over $  billion to TDC per year - they will probably be converted over to the cloud-based offering (which results in more attractive economics and earnings visibility). This last part is a crucial aspect of the valuation (below).    Competitive Advantages       Network effects : as customers move data to the cloud, the more easily data can be exchanged between customers that share the same platform      Snowflake cited this as a competitive advantage, it applies to TDC as well    High switching costs : adopting a large database is a time consuming process that is also a pain in the ass. Once complete, people don’t want to leave. This is evident in TDC customer retention even in spite of cloud disruptions.    Cost savings : data insights result in cost savings for the customer. this is the difference between life and death of business these days    Intellectual Property : Decades’ worth of IP (600+ patents) and reputation as an industry pioneer    \ \ \ \  Competitive Positioning \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  (READ THIS IF YOU READ ANYTHING AT ALL)    Not only is TDC pivoting to the cloud to survive, but research suggests that it might even be better than Snowflake.  In a recent interview, CEO Steve McMillan said the following  >“I’m going to say a couple things that will surprise some people,” he says. “I think our 40-year heritage in helping organizations get the best out of their data \[gives us\] a set of experiences and a set of capabilities and a set of technology advances that    Snowflake are going to have to take a long time to catch up with us   \ .\ “Look, if you want to set up a simple data mart with a little bit of DSS \[decision support systems\], Snowflake is going to work fine for you,” McMillan continues. “For companies that want to operate at enterprise scale–and I haven’t met a small company that doesn’t want to be a big company–and they want to operate at scale in a really cost-effective way,    Teradata is a better choice than Snowflake.”     He goes a step further  >“We have differentiation that we think is    four or five years ahead where Snowflake    \[is\] in terms of things like workload management and data governance and some of the core, deep SQL engine capabilities that we have in our product that just aren’t replicated inside Snowflake,”  And the finale  >“When we see customers making that transition, making that migration to cloud, they’ve not been able to get the same level of performance and scale, either from the native cloud providers or the likes of Snowflake, in terms of just operating at that level of scale and consistency,” McMillan says. “So it’s really interesting as we double down on the \[cloud\] message and we’ve taken it back to    customers who may have moved off Teradata and tried these cloud providers, we’re seeing those workloads start to come back to Teradata in the cloud   .”    \ \ \ \ \  IN OTHER WORDS, MCMILLAN SUGGESTS THAT TDC IS STEALING CUSTOMERS BACK FROM SNOWFLAKE. THIS IS HUGE. (LINK BELOW) \ \ \ \ \        Gartner also suggests that Teradata Vantage is superior to Snowflake in every use case:    Gartner scored Teradata higher than Snowflake in every use case of its Cloud Database Management Systems          Teradata Vantage was listed as a market leader ahead of snowflake in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems:  📷          Valuation     Snowflake (SNOW)     Snowflake IPO’d in 2020 at an \~$80 billion valuation. They claim that they are chasing an $80 billion end market (annually), which has people excited, and rightfully so - this is a pretty exciting time for cloud-based data analytics.   In the trailing 4 quarters, Snowflake posted $480 million in revenues. The stock trades at $300, or an $80 billion market cap. This implies a \~160x price-to-sales ratio (which is frankly ridiculous imo).   During its first earnings call, SNOW reported 119% revenue growth   Teradata (TDC)     As of close (2/8/21), TDC was a $  billion company.   In its earnings report last week, TDC reported that its emerging public cloud business reached $106 million in annual recurring revenues, up 165% from a year   is ape shit growth. The type that rustles people’s jimmies.   TDC is guiding for another 160% increase in Q1 2021, and a 100% increase in FY 2021.   In total TDC reported $  billion of recurring revenue, most of this is the legacy business.   Before the earnings announcement, which caught Wall Street/Snowflake investors off guard, TDC was valued at $  billion - so it’s fair to say this is what the legacy business is worth. This is your valuation floor.   At 160x revenues (what Snowflake is being valued at), TDC’s public cloud business is worth $17 billion. I’d also point out (again) that TDC is a 40-year innovator here and is rated higher than Snowflake by Gartner in all use-case categories.   Now, I think it’s fair to say that in growing the cloud business, TDC is going to convert legacy customers from the on-prem solution to the public cloud solution. If it converts another $100 million of its $  billion to the cloud biz, that’s another $17 billion valuation. Now we’re looking at a $34 billion business.   34 billion /   billion =   upside    Price Targets      Base case: $7 billion ($64 stock price). This is below JMP’s recent price target ($70). At $7 billion, TDC’s cloud biz would be valued at $  billion (43x revenues, or 75% lower than SNOW's valuation).   Bull case: $17 billion ($155 stock price). At this level, TDC’s public cloud biz would be valued at 170x revenues (same as SNOW).   Moon case: $34 billion ($300+ stock price). At this price, TDC’s public cloud biz would get the same valuation as SNOW, but we would also value another $100 million of revenues at 170x revenues, which would represent future conversions from the company’s existing legacy customer base to the cloud-native solution.    Near-term catalysts      Recent earnings results shocked investors in a positive way, but not all of the gains have been made. It takes the average buyside investor 2 weeks to complete DD, so we're still getting ahead of the big money here.   TDC has 20% short interest, so 1 in 5 shares are sold short. These shorts are going to cover ASAP because the recent earnings report was nothing short of transformative. TDC never broke out its cloud-based annual recurring revenues until last week - this basically killed the short thesis and turned TDC from a deep value stock into an aggressive cloud-based saas business overnight.   People are realizing that TDC was a hidden gem and is the cheapest way to play the parabolic growth market of cloud-based data warehousing/analytics. (see yesterday's Barron’s     Given the massive valuation spread between SNOW and TDC, and the apparent technological superiority of TDC, we could be on the right side of a popular hedge fund pair trade (long TDC, short SNOW). This wouldn't be a bad trade if you guys want some risk-adjusted tendies     Recently-posted on seeking alpha:         2/11/2021 Update  : For those that need to focus on a valuation floor, try and look at TDC as a sum of the parts:  We know the legacy business is worth $3 billion. TDC was a $3 billion stock before management broke out the cloud revenues last week.   So depending on how much you think the cloud business is worth, here is what the stock is worth  $47 per share or $  billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 20x sales)       $66 per share or $  billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $  billion (TDC Cloud @ 40x sales)       $76 per share or $  billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $  billion (TDC Cloud @ 60x sales)       $105 per share or $  billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $  billion (TDC Cloud @ 80x sales)       $125 per share or $  billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $  billion (TDC Cloud @ 100x sales)       $190 per share or $21 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $18 billion (TDC Cloud @ 170x sales)          Compare that to other somewhat related cloud stocks: SNOW (170x), MDB (43x), FSLY (50x),  DDOG (60x).  So if you value the cloud biz at less than half of the cheapest above peer ( , then the stock is worth $48. If it's valued at the same level as the cheapest peer (MDB @ 43x) then we're looking at a $70 stock.    Hang in there and be patient.
Robinhood was calling my account a Margin account when I never had that enabled
I had some issues with my Robinhood to Fidelity rollover, (even as a longtime fidelity customer for Pre-tax and Roth accounts) so after spending a really really REEEEALLY long time on hold to get to the right rep at Fidelity they mentioned my account was transferred as a margin account by Robinhood, which was largely contributing to the issues.   I have NEVER had margin enabled on my account. I didn’t trade options there, everything was pre-funded with cash from my bank account.   They also mentioned that it was happening to a lot of other people transferring from Robinhood! Now I am not sure what benefit Robinhood is gaining from this and I am sure someone smarter than me will chime in the comments, but this feels very sketchy to me.   One more reason to jump off that sinking ship before it goes like the titanic to the bottom of the sea!
Extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds
The title of Charles MacKay’s book keeps echoing in my head as I watch the GME crowd continue to desperately milk what’s left of probably the best trade this century. A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it’s sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.  It’s become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn’t been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.  I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, “this is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.” So with that said I’m making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.  People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‘how to use options’ section.   People claiming “sHoRtS hAvEn’T cOvErEd YeT” despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.  On a final note, I’m going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.    1. Displacement    A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.    2. Boom    Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain   attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.    3. Euphoria    During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and   was higher than the GDP of most nations.    4. Profit-Taking    In this phase, the   put it, "the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.    5. Panic    It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with   declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $  trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.  GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding. Congrats, you just played yourself and have brought shame to your family, your village and all of China.
While you were Partying I Bought CRSR
When you were making dinner for your wife and her boyfriend I mastered the desktop aesthetic.  While you wasted your days at the yahoo finance message board in pursuit of tendies I cultivated wealth.  And now that the shorts are on fire and the autists are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for help?
AMC HIGH/LOW TODAY>>>FEB 8TH,21>>$  IM LOSING MY BANANA
FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16
Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.  The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don’t want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company.   I’m a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other.   ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi’s it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small.   Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross   by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I’d call a great options deal.   Note: I don’t provide sell points, so don’t ask. Every post I’ve made provides the opportunity to make money, it won’t change with ON, don’t be to greedy, and take your free money once it’s there.
I believe Qualcomm will recover
This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback.    I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months.   Following their   Their equipment and services division brought in $  billion. They had an operating income of   billion.   Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.   All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I’ve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound.    It is possible the sell off may be due to       Probably some bad DD. Not financial advice. Please tell me how to improve.
The Melvin Meme Stonk War: Part One (Audio in description, much more funny)
GameStop, the Endgame of Wallstreet: their whole playbook explained and why naked shorts won’t show up in next short interest .
THEORY: 1) Robinhood and others block the buying . Then limit the buying to a couple of shares . 2) hedge funds 1 combine forces together and sell naked GME stock with delivery in 2days (T2)  3) because retail is limited to buy a couple of shares , the shares sold are +90% bought by a friendly hedge fund 2.  4) hedge fund 2 sells again those shares at a lower price to hedge fund 1 , hedge fund 1 delivers the naked short shares to the clearinghouse before T2 ends. = no new short interest is recorded or will be added to the 2 weekly short interest  5) due that the naked short shares are back delivered before T2, no high borrowing interest needs to be paid . And this game does cost them nothing .   CONDITIONS:  This game above works only perfect if the naked short shares sold do NOT LAND IN TO OTHER HANDS , then those of the hedge funds gang.  Otherwise they can not be given sold back to hedge fund 1 to give back before T2.  HOW:  1. Block and after limit retail investors from buying more shares as those will be lost in this closed circle ⭕️ between hedge funds.  The deal has to be done across all brokerages . This is mass scale manipulation.  2. Block retail investors from shorting shares as that would provide a buying spree if prices go up again.   ZERO COST:  The above closed circle of naked short selling to other hedge funds is a zero cost (except the the little shares lost to retail buyers on the min purchase price ) no high borrowing interest to be paid , so in theory they could do this as long as retail is limited to buy new shares AND stimulated to sell their shares .   PARALLEL CHAIN:  Although the above game does cost them nothing , their need to be a gain of getting cheap shares out of the pockets of the retail holders . HOW: step guide :  1. Lower the margin value of GME stock so you can not buy other things by just holding on your GME stock. You need to sell them to create cash that can be used to buy other things THEY place in your mind as a good buy.  And this part is the following : 1. DISTRACTION: Divide the retail group power munition: create hype in other things as Silver , Nokia , etc so the retail Wallstreetbeds gang shoots their arrows on other targets . Less arrows left = less munition for the real battle GME.  2. Create a link with the distraction group and the main target GME. So they all belong to the same investment ideas.  Even if they have nothing to do with each other . People will later link them in their mind . Nesasary for the next steps.  3. Pull retail investors back in to the Original Gamestonk = TESLA:     - Interview with Musk in Clubhouse who invites Vladimir Tenev CEO of Robinhood.     - Price target upgrade for TSLA of 120% by Piper Sandler why sundenly comes with this upgrade a week after an earnings miss when all other analyst came out a week before with no changes in their PT.      - and it worked, the same morning TSLA started to go up, GME went down . And the same for the next day .  4. Media has to publish stories that the Reddit group investors are selling (a story to justify the price decline) and or moving to other targets as silver and Nokia .  5. Let the DISTRACTION group fall, because before media has tagged /correlated/linked  the distraction group to the main target GME, the fall of these distraction group tricks your mind thinking that your main target GME will fail also .  A psychology mind trick. Although they are not the same, your mind will feel it as the same and makes you nervous that your investment GME is next to fail. With as goal you can not hold the stress and give up your shares.   REMOVE RETAIL investors arms: Every retail investor is focussed on the short interest publication. What is published every 2 weeks and with delay . It’s only a snapshot of ONE DAY.   this can also be gamed.  One day before the snapshot , hedge fund 2 sells naked new shares and hedge fund 1 buys them. Delivers them back to the clearinghouse and they will publish it as a lower outstanding short interest .  Hedge fund 2 that sold naked has 2 days to clear their naked shorts before they will be marked as short interest . They follow the above playbook.   All above is IMO of what I have seen. It is not an investment advice. But it could give your mind some peace and Birdseye view on all what is happening around you now, so you make calculated decisions on your investment and can leave emotions out of it.   Although for us retail investors it’s harder to know what your fellow army members will do as you can not see them. Compare to the hedge fund gang they do know each other and have agreements .  And we do not know if management of GME is on our side , they could do a secundaire offering.   Our strength is the millions of ants 🐜🐜🐜 that are fighting an elephant 🐘🐘🐘 gang . If the paper loss at the moment is very small in amounts $ (not %) of each retail investor who believes and KNOW the plan of the elephant elephant 🐘🐘🐘gang.   We could win.  Even the small amounts of shares that each retail is allowed to buy , that is so small they even do not care if they lose it, multiplied by millions of ants 🐜 🐜🐜🐜nibbling on the shares the hedge fund gang sell naked and buy back between each other will increase the short interest over time .

Can we get a real answer regarding GME
I have never gotten an answer to this. But can those who posted "5000 is not a meme" as we where falling to 50€ (I have no idea what it is now I'm scared to check) please explain this sentiment? I'm holding because I have no other option. But some perspective would be nice.  Can you "to the moon, 5000 is not a meme, diamond hands" etc... People please give a straight non meme answer And properly refute the doom and gloom regarding GME that has taken over here.  I admit I joined this place after hearing about the gme rocket in the news and yes I went in due to FOMO and yes I spent money I couldn't afford to lose and yes I have very limited understanding of the stock market and yep I went in when it was at 310 or 320€.  Can anyone please give some clarification. Have the hedgefunds cleared their short positions? Is it true that if we wait long enough we in basically get to set the price? hen will this happen?   EDIT received some real and non insultingly answers via pm some explained that it's over and why. Others say it can still go to 700 - 1000 and why.  This serves no other purpose than to be mean for some people so it might as well be locked
$GLW versatile and underpriced! Autists unite
first DD, hope I do ok! this is not financial advice, I am a dunce mostly. Do your own research! With that said, Tuesday I am buying $38 and $42 calls for next month  and buying every dip when I get my last check from McDonald’s this week.  $GLW corning incorporated  market cap;   Billion P/E ratio   dividend yield   Institutional ownership 77%    Why should a company that has been in business for 170 years with a solid track record of innovation and diversity only be worth $36 a share? 170 years of proven business accumen and multiple industries. Now I will step off my soapbox and lay out the argument for why this stock is undervalued right now.  This company is in 7 major industries and poised to break ahead in at least 2. I will take them one at a time and provide examples. browse their expansive list of patents and products, i will highlight a few with more links and comparison to other industry related companies below.   	optical communications (5g, Optical fiber, etc etc) multiple patents and competitive pricing   similar company Lumentum holdings $LITE market cap   price per share- $93 P/E ratio $  Dividend Yield X Institutional ownership 91%     	mobile consumer electronics  this market is poised for a breakout on their part, due to a shortage of semiconductor chips due to increased demand.     similar company taiwan semiconductors $TSM price per share- $138 market cap 581B P/E ratio $  dividend yield   institutional ownership 20%  	life science glassware This industry has been hit hard by supply chain issues and corning is gaining traction due to not experiencing the same issues, to top it off they have a superior product at competitive pricing. Oh and then they just received a grant from the goverment to make these vials for the covid vaccine. Once they hit the market that hard, they wont go away.  similar company Danaher corporation market cap 174B price per share- $245 P/E ratio   Dividend yield .26% institutional ownership 80%

Why was this highly popular post removed?
This post by u/inverseyourself reached   upvotes before it was removed. If I understand the auto-mod correctly, it cannot have been done by it, since the auto-mod would remove it directly based on the contents of the post, not hours later when it has already become popular.  The post can still be read in another subreddit, so if you're interested check it out in the post history of u/inverseyourself.   It really makes me suspicious of wallstreetbets and its mods. This kind of DD post would have been fine a while ago, now it simply gets removed?
Why I am GME
GME is me. I am GME. This is a serious post. \ THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\   I bought GME to make money. There is no way around it. No need to lie or fake it like most the people on here. I held to make a statement. I got in at $300 for 100 shares hoping it would go to the moon. I didn't sell at $375. $470. I held. And now, even at $  am holding. This is no longer about money. This is about Good VS Evil. The average man vs the 1%. This is the fight of a lifetime.  I didn't grow up rich. Every penny I made and invested I bled for. No excuses. So I write this message of hope. HOLD. HOLD THE LINE. I've seen so many post with no context. HOLD your positions because you think it's bullshit that Robinhood sold out. Melvin can manipulate the market. That the SEC continues to turn a blind eye to all that is happening. I don't even want to win back my money. I want to stick it to Melvin and every other hedge fund that rips people off. I survived 2008. I saw tons of 401ks turn into dust. And then the government bailed out the Big Banks and all the shady brokers that helped make this happen. They didn't pay for anything. They just got away with it and got even bolder.  To all the people who threw in their HARD EARNED MONEY, don't despair. KARMA happens to us all. The Hedgies will get what is coming to them. Stay strong. This is no longer about riding the rocket to the moon. Paper vs Diamond hands. This is working blue collar, working white collar vs the ELITE. The establishment. If you read this and I'm still alive, then I am still holding. I refuse to give in to them.  MURICA.     \ EDIT Portion\   Omgahhh my first Gold! Thanks y’all.   Thanks for the silver award. First one ever!  To all the haters and negative people. Why? What do you gain? Are you pro hedge funds? Are you pro 1%? Because unless you have 8-9 figures sitting in your bank account and you don't care about all the little people, you aren't one of them so stop acting like it.  I’m not forcing or trying to convince anyone to hold. I’m simply giving my logic to why I haven’t sold yet. It’s an opinion. You either agree or disagree. The button goes up or down. Pretty simple.   To all the people who understand, we in this together. Much <3
The only way to save WSB?
The very nature of this subreddit means its sentiment is an attractive product for manipulation. Twitter and Facebook have been actively filled with bots for years, or even "farms" of real humans doing the typing. It's been made very clear bad-faith actors are powerful enough to make you hate your neighbor and even impact elections. Reddit is no different.  Without even considering the above, growing 4x overnight is damaging enough by itself. The culture of the sub will always be heavily diluted with the wrong kind of chromosomes if no drastic actions are taken.  Generally, if you ran this type of sub and saw millions of Autist Andy's joining from the news, you would have decided to private the sub for its own good before it got out of hand. Did any mods advocate for this? Who was against it? Are they still here? This seems like an important topic to touch on I haven't seen mentioned really.  In my view, the only way to reverse all the drama and division from the original community would be to revert the sub back to its pre-media follower count and privatize afterwards. This should help quell the "diamondhand ape together strong" disease.  New retards should be consolidated on a special fleet of short buses to a new subreddit for a period of time before being allowed over. I lurked WSB for years, but did not participate in the community until recently. Now I see fringe WSB communities making r/all and conspiracies all around. A lot of top posts/comments on diff subreddits are about this subreddit being "compromised" - how do you change the cancer of that sentiment? Are those types of posts majorly upvoted by hype train bagholders, or do OGs feel this way? I know everyone wants zjz and a lot might not come back or change their mind due to his departure - but its been shown we have admins to blame for that, not mods. But   something should be done to repair the damage that the media has caused to the OG WSB contributors. I think that showing the media and hedge funds how easy it is to infiltrate a community is a dangerous precedent to set. Change my mind.
WSB subreddit of people of only people that have comments from before ~April 2020.
Someone should create a subreddit and only allow people of the old WSB for a while and after a while maybe open it. That will help all those people bitching that things aren't like they used to be. And allow retards to frolic in peace.     I'm too lazy to create it and I don't even think I have posts from then but someone should. Think about it, you could be the savior of WSB. Financial Times would quote your user name and elon musk might even say something about you.      I mostly want a way to know who to sell really dumb puts and calls to.
Why I am super BULLISH on GME
1. GME is owned massively by retail investors 2. Retail investors don't move in block like institutions when they decide to make a move but they are a lot more fluid being moved by different expectations  3. Retail investors care about sentiment and sentiment is strong against HF that are shorting GME 4. GME is heavily shorted 5. If price goes up, shorter have to cover, and to cover they need to buy stock from market 6. See point 1 again please  7. Retail investors have massive expectations in term of target price and have diamond hands  8. To cover short HF will need to buy the stock from retailers, paying the price they demand. Based on what we observed this is at least 400$ 9. We like the stock  10. We can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent  Position: 20@~200 and that's is how I traded
Why not a single GME thread daily?
I get it, y’all hating on GME flooding the sub these days, but why remove the daily thread? The 6 mill people that joined the last couple of weeks came here for GME, why not let them talk about it in a SINGLE daily thread? Why not keep a tiny place where we can post our rockets and get ecstatic as it goes up 1%? Most of you don’t even have to enter it, and can simply ignore it. Is this really too much to ask? I miss the opportunity to cheer every time it goes in green with my fellow apes.                                                                                                                                    I have invested in GME and If $GME$ hits $150 this week I will buy every single item on r/activedeals & donate it to my local hospital.
Starting to think AMC might not go to $
Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg... and my arm... even my fingers.... the body I’ve lost... the comrades we’ve all lost... won’t stop hurting... it’s like they’re all still there. You feel it too, don’t you?  Currently down  , still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I’ll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $  sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we’ll see a rebound. So I’ll keep holding  Position: 107 shares & 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $  avg, holding out there too  Edit: stop telling me to sell. I’m not a pussy and would rather lose 100% than sell and admit I made a mistake  Edit 2: to the guy who said “AMC just sells overpriced popcorn and the ability to sit in a seat” but who’s comment was deleted: Uhh, yeah. No shit Sherlock. Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C vid is over, maybe it’ll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe. Situations like this is just a roulette table but there’s a small weak magnet under all the numbers where we lose money. Go look it up if you want, or laugh at my pain, I genuinely could not care less   EDIT3:   Were going up after hours     this is it boys  and girls , THIS IS NOT A DRILL. tomorrow could be the day it rises up to $ , here are some rockets to signify my strong belief in the underlying company and my love for the stock

Robinhood Alternatives
Most of my money is tied up in Robinhood and I do plan on keeping what I have there, but I want to diversify into other brokers so that all of my eggs aren't in one basket and all of that. So far I have already opened accounts with WeBull, Fidelity, ETrade, & Schwab. The problem I'm running into, and I guess it's a minor annoyance in the big scheme of things, is that I like Robinhood's app so much better than the others. I basically only deal with options and all of the other apps seem to be rather clunky in comparison to Robinhood.      Is there someone else doing it as well as Robinhood that I just haven't tried yet? Looking for suggestions.

Datto (MSP) & Options Play
Datto is a recently IPO'ed company that makes backup & disaster recovery equipment for IT people. Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers & switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).  They are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $ $25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $  is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $  or $  during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $ , or $      The bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.     EDIT: I was able to get a $20 call option at $  Stock trading at \~$ , so only $.35 before ITM!
The Fish and the Big Meal - Path to the Moon Part 2
There once was a Big Meal and all the fish in all the seas wanted a ticket to this Big Meal.  One day a very clever fish convinced a bunch of retarded fish to buy tickets for this meal and hold on to them which increased the price exponentially. The retarded fish could then sell the tickets back to the Snakes making a profit.   Soon enough all the other fish in the sea heard about this Game and came to help. But by then it was too late, the price of a meal ticket was more than any little fish could afford.  The Snakes seeing this plan had succeeded in almost bankrupting them did a cunty spineless move and sold tickets between themselves to make the price of a ticket go down, so the retarded fish couldn’t put them out of business.  The retarded fish were obstinate and they continued to hold onto their meal tickets despite the price going down. ever so slowly, ever so painfully as many of the fish who got in late lost money and sold off their tickets.   Some retarded fish thought they could make the price go up again by buying more but this was ineffectual as the activity of the Snakes was too much and more and more fish each day were giving up and selling their tickets to make some cash back and feed their fishwives and retarded fish children.  Silly fish thought a smart snail watching from the sidelines, if only the retarded fish could see that if they stopped buying more tickets and let the big fish who bought lots of tickets sell one at a time, the price would lower so more fish could buy even more tickets. Eventually the Snakes wouldn’t have any tickets to sell between themselves.     The smart snail offered to help the retarded fish defeat the Snakes by delivering a clever strategy for success. “Go away crazy snail, that would never work,” said the retarded fish. “We don’t want the Snakes out of business we just want to buy tickets.” Stupid retard fish they thought the game was only about buying and holding tickets.  If only the retarded fish would stop sending each other memes and sucking each other’s dicks all day they might actually take over the Big Meal Business, if only they could see that it was them who had all the numbers they needed to swarm the Snakes and take all the tickets from them and their would be nothing the Snakes could do about it in time.  Poor Retarded Fish, thought the smart snail, guess they’ll never learn, I guess now they’ll always be Poor Retarded Fish. (sigh)    This is not financial advice this is a story about retarded fish.  Edit: There was a conflict and there were a few victors and many losers. In the distance a tidal wave approaches. In the end nobody wins if wars are fought with cunning and betrayal. Ultimately something must be let go of in order to move forward.

Full Year 2021 Outlook    \- Net revenue to be in the range of $  billion to $  billion  \- Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million  \- Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $215 million to $230 million       Recent Developments    \- On February 1, 2021, in the patent infringement case, Ironburg Inventions Ltd. v. Valve Corp, the jury unanimously found that Valve Corp infringed Ironburg’s controller patent and awarded Corsair’s subsidiary Ironburg (a subsidiary of SCUF) over $4 million       My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)      -   I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $  billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.  \- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018.   The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair’s products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.   Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair’s higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty.   \- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators. The margins are much higher in this area than in components and streamer customers seem to regard Elgato products with high enthusiasm.  \- Adjusted EBITDA tripled in 2020 to $213 million which it seems can be attributed to an explosion of demand for Corsair’s products by customers who are spending more time at home working and gaming.
A delisted stock and some late   out, I am the meme.
You know what they say, always get more aggressive rather than defensive when you start to lose money.
Aphria/Tilray Merger
Second time posting this. Made it last night but other than a collab between CGC and APHA, news about the merger seems to be the same this morning.  This is my first DD so please bare with me in case I set something up wrong; I'm happy to edit if so but this took me a while to gather.  I just joined this sub about two weeks ago amidst the GME hype. I've been investing for a few years now ever since the Tilray IPO at $17. Bought, sold, and reinvested consistently (pulling out my principal each time) right up through the almost $300 peak and backed out. I left Tilray alone for a while until recently when the news regarding the merger with Aphria started popping up because I actually love Aphria and I've owned it for a while now, so I wanted to post some DD regarding the merger. Hope this helps some of you.    For the business:   Reverse merger is taking place where Aphria is absorbing Tilray and will own 63% of the company, continuing to use the name Tilray due to better brand recognition and its nearly eponymous representation of the cannabis market. Aphria has a strong presence in Germany which is the only European country with medical marijuana, so Aphria has an advantage in that sector for if/when other European nations start following suit. With both Aphria's and Tilray's international relations along with slowly migrating into the US they may grow into the largest cannabis company worldwide just in terms of revenue.  Over the previous 12 months, Aphria put up $443 million USD in revenue compared to Canopy Growth's $377m USD. Tilray has put up $201m USD in the last 12 months, and which combined with Aphria is $644m USD, or markedly higher than the $377m USD posted by the "industry standard," Canopy Growth. (I don't hate on Canopy as a company whatsoever I just think they're overvalued and their stock should not be in the $40s).  Stats from the merger indicated a $685 million annual revenue, adjusted for combined sales, and the company itself, named Tilray, will have a roughly $  billion valuation.  Also, many forget that Tilray has a business partnership with Anheuser-Busch and Aphria owns the craft beer company SweetWater. (Which, personally, is fucking delicious.)    For the shareholder:   Each Aphria share will convert to   shares of Tilray. As of today (Monday, 02/08/21) the closing price of Tilray was $  and the price of Aphria was $  In accordance to the   1 : .8381   conversion rate, the implied price of Aphria is $ , which has a 33% upside compared to the current share price.  I don't know the current borrowing rates (if anyone does please feel free to comment), but in January of 2019 the shorting cost for Tilray was above 900% and has been known to remain very high on this stock, as after it's $300 rally a couple years ago it became a favorite among the shorts. There is a way in which to capitalize on the merger by being long on Aphria and short Tilray, but the 30% profit may be outweighed by the crazy high costs of borrowing.  The two biggest risks appear to be the possibility that Aphria shares will crash days before the merger, or that that Tilray has simply been overvalued this entire time and its share price will fall. ( The strategy is listed in the sources here     but you can only open the articles once without a subscription     For everyone:   The general consensus on both stocks is bullish, however, more focus is placed on buying into Tilray than Aphria, seemingly just due to the belief that people may jump ship days before Aphria shares are converted into Tilray (even though Aphria still owns the operation). The company will also have easy access into the United States as our president restructures drug scheduling, so moving forward, I feel that Tilray is going to be a strong global competitor in the cannabis industry for some time  I try not to go balls deep on anything that has a lot of hype on it, but Tilray made me BANK right when I first started investing a few months before Canada legalized so I may be biased. However, as objectively as I can be, I do think this merger is both a very strong short and long option.  I don't really know if it's a necessary disclaimer or a joke but I'm gonna go ahead and say no, none of this is financial advice.    My positions:   100 APHA @ $ ,  2 TSLA @ $ ,  3 GME @ $165,  10 AMC @ $ ,  100 SNDL @ $ ,  100 22 RIGL @ $   Calls: APHA $20 2/19,  TLRY $37 2/19,  SENS $4 2/19,  CRBP $3 2/19,  RIGL $5 2/19  I'm transferring both my RH and TDA accounts over to Fidelity so all my stocks are in different places atm, otherwise I'd post a picture.    Sources:                           Edit: Fixed conversion rate typo from incorrect: 1:   .08381   to 1 :   .8381   (Thank you u/Stunna2018)  Edit 2:  Added the following list below of supporting info for legalizing marijuana nationwide.  A trio of   senators has given investors the green light to invest in  marijuana stocks, an endorsement that suggests the volatile sector might finally  blossom into something as acceptable and regulated as alcohol.  More details will emerge when Sens. Cory Booker (D.,  ,  Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.), and Chuck Schumer (D.,    introduce legislation to legalize and tax marijuana.  "In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft  on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and  implement responsible taxes and regulations," they announced Feb.  1 in a joint statement.  The marijuana sector has, naturally, advanced higher. The sector proxy, the  ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange- traded fund , has seemingly entered a new,  higher trading range. The ETF holds 35 stocks, including Aphria(APHA) , Canopy Growth(CGC) , and GW Pharmaceuticals(GWPH) . The fund has about  $  billion under management, which makes it the largest ETF  that targets the global cannabis industry.  In anticipation of the pending legislation, and in an attempt to harness the  momentum of other investors, aggressive investors can consider buying ETFMG  Alternative Harvest. The ETF is trading near a record high, but an options  strategy can potentially reshape the price.  With the ETF at $ , investors can sell the March  $25 put option for $  and buy the March  $29 call option for about $  The "risk  reversal" -- selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but  similar expiration -- positions investors for agreeing to buy the ETF at  $25 and for participating in gains above $29.  If the ETF is at $35 at March expiration, the call is worth $6.  The trade's risk is predicated on the pending legislation. The trade obligates investors to buy the stock at $23, or to cover the put  or roll the position, if the stock price is below the strike price at  expiration. For that reason, only do this trade if you have the resources and  willingness to buy the ETF at a lower price and a belief in marijuana's pending  legalization. If something happens in Washington that derails marijuana legalization  efforts, the trade falls apart.  Still, the trade is a good way for investors to gain exposure to the  legalization of marijuana, which seems like a good bet as federal government  contends with massive deficits caused by the 2007-09 financial crisis and the  Covid-19 pandemic.  The ETF was chosen over component stocks to potentially reduce the investment  risk that is inherent in picking stocks in an unusual sector with companies that  have a history of extraordinary price volatility.  During the past 52 weeks, the ETF has ranged from $  to  $  The fund gained about 45% over the past year and is up  some 67% this year. The percentage returns seem stellar, but it is important to  remember that the fund has advanced off a low price, and that many of the  components weren't much better situated. The sector could be facing a critical  moment, and this trade puts investors into the center of the industry with a  strategy that can be reset as each month passes. Email:    Edit 3: Tilray short interest now at 51%    Edit 4: Thank you all for the awards, especially the tendies but go spend that money on pot/stocks!!
How I was acting with my boss holding my 100 GME when it peaked at $483
GME Holders on 2/9
Did we not say that important data would come out on 2/9? Where the heck did everyone go?   The point of investing in GME was primarily to stick it to the hedge funds and ride it out until they couldn’t do it anymore. If you can’t stand to lose money, you shouldn’t invest or you invested more than you were willing to lose.  If you’re a real holder, you’re waiting to see what happens. I hold 55 shares of GME at $224.  Edit: Holy cow I’m getting ripped apart in the comments lol. Yes the point is also to make money, and I’m here out of principle.  Edit 2: The main reason I bought so much is that I was so frustrated and upset by Citadel’s and Robinhood’s actions as well as those by other brokerages. If you don’t believe me, then I don’t know what to tell you.  Edit 3: I just like the stock
Does your damning CNN Interview keep getting deleted by YouTube? Put it on the permanent web and prevent censorship by mainstream media.
Hey guys,  By request, I have uploaded that CNN interview about WSB to IPFS so it can no longer be removed by YouTube or anything. Feel free to spread the link around - I have no ownership rights to take it down, so yeah. It's there forever now. You're welcome.

IPFS is like a permanent archive - more permanent than   - yeah.  Show your support for their project over there - they're fighting to ensure an open web for generations.  # Look here apes     Hi everyone - a little more context on why I did this. It wasn’t necessarily for the specific video... but to show y’all that you can preserve evidence permanently using IPFS. It’s like the cloud... but it never goes away (it is “Byzantine fault tolerant”)  If you see something say something but also download the fucking video and put it in IPFS so corporate scum at Google can’t suppress your speech.

$UMC and other “less glamorous” semi-conductor manufacturers will likely do well in the coming months
With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can’t sell their products due to the limits on chips designer’s limits of wafers of a given process node.  As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the “big fabs” that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips. Essentially, any company in the position of AMD (even Intel and Nvidia are facing this problem) that can sell its products like hotcakes, but can’t get the nodes they need for their top-of-the-line products is bound by what they ordered months or years in advance. It is very likely that this will resonate as a prime reason to use lesser-utilized nodes by other companies for various other components (Internet-of-things, 5G etc...)  Essentially, chip  designers  are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these “big-name” computing technology companies that you’re used to hearing about are essentially bidding with eachother for these same advanced process nodes, kicking smaller (and by  smaller  I don’t mean  small , I mean literally anyone that isn’t trying to +1 extremely advanced computing products).  TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip  designers  will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.  This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for  any  process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.  Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion’s share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It’s quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.  At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.  There’s already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other “less sexy” fabs to meet demand for chips that they  need  now.  In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.  I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.    This is not financial advice, I am   and I am currently sauteeing crayons in a pan    EDIT:   has very in-depth descriptions of various companies, many of which you’re familiar with. If you’re new to learning about computer hardware, and chip-manufacturing, it’s a great place to due your own research to learn the mechanics of chip-design, material sourcing, architectures, photolithographic techniques, recent innovations, etc...
Operation Moon $NOK NOK!!
Short interest from td ameritrade news
Welcome to the battle
For all of you who can't hear the GME battle cries any longer, its due to your ear drums being shattered by all the BS the media has fed you these past few weeks.  There has been a tier 1 KILLSWITCH operation aiming to make GME disappear. And for many, it worked.  No longer is GME on the lips of every mother and father in the beautiful United States.  No longer is it the meme of the week, they want us to move on, forget about the stock, forget our fallen comrades at level 300, 400, 450...  But nay, We will never forget our fallen. I sure as hell haven't, and I am still holding on like a vice grip.  We cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won't do shit. Now his clown ass is desperately trying to do the same to those videos on YT as they have done to GME.  But the internet never forgets.  This is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares.  (\ you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)  BUT I'm holding to the bitter end if it comes to that. I lost 88% so what's another 12% mean to me?  Nothing.  I am only writing this to find the ears of my fellow R-tards across the world who grow weak on this battlefield. We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.  My logic is this, I've read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I've gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.  Well hedgies... I SAY:  FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER! KARMA IS A BITCH. TRUST ME. I'VE MET HER. THERE'S NO RUNNING FROM IT. I'VE PAID FOR MY SINS TENFOLD, EVEN WHEN I LAUGHED SAYING ALL OF THAT KARMIC BS WAS  JUST THAT... BS.  But I found out soon enough and I am paying for my wrong doings.  I say this to my enemies.  You know who you are.  "One day. You'll get a\ \  f\ \ \ ed so hard by some event, an event that will enrage you like never before, anger will erupt from the pit of your soul, and for a moment... you'll recall this post, how you were part of the operation that fucked over an entire community of small fish trying to make honest profit while playing by your rules, and you pulled the goddamn plug out of the wall when we started to win.  And you'll realize... ahhh... fuck you karma... well played."     TL;DR - I am holding, you do you, karma will find those who did wrong and they will pay. In the mean time I am still.....holding the line. I know you shorts still haven't covered.

Robinhood is still playing games
So here I am buying stocks off Robinhood and even though they're trash they have this nifty little thing that lets you instantly access money up to $1000 once you make a deposit which usually takes 4-5 business days give or take  Anyways this has never failed me UNTIL I bought AMC and then all of a sudden there's a bank error and I have an account deficit so any stocks I bought didn't go through okay well that's cool I'll just cover the deficit alright all the stocks I bought went through now  EXCEPT ONE  AMC didn't get bought again like all my other stocks did which is sketchy but it's okay I'll just buy it again but no wait my instant access is denied until my money fully deposits in 4-5 business days and I cannot open any new positions until then but if that's the case why was I able to buy all my other stocks and not AMC  Honestly this is all very sketchy and they're still out here playing games and messing with people's money  KEEP HOLDING EVERYONE WE WILL NOT LET THEM WIN THEY CAN'T KEEP US DOWN  HOLD TO THE MOON
Stilling holding strong boys!!!

PTON - Short term technical play, Long term extremely bullish
This post is going to describe a play that's kinda technical. So stop gnawing on your crayons for a second and pay attention.  First off, quick summary for people who can read an 8-K. If you only understand     , don't worry, I explain it in more detail with more emojis.    TL;DR:   PTON just finalized sales of convertible notes and they're using $71M from the proceeds to buy call options on themselves to negate any dilutionary effects. They state in their 8-K  that the option counterparty is going to be buying PTON stock IMMEDIATELY to hedge risk. However you cut it, that's likely 300k-1M+ shares that need to be bought this week.     ## The Play  If that was gibberish, I'll try to spell it out. PTON just sold $1B of convertible notes to wall street.     What are convertible notes?     Convertible notes are a type of debt, but instead of just offering to repay the creditor with cash, you give them the option of converting their loan to newly issued shares at a price established before hand. You could also think of it as a call option but, if it's out of the money at expiration, you can get your premium back, and if it's in the money you can ask the company to issue new shares for you.     What's a call option?     GTFO     But wait, isn't creating new shares bad? Wouldn't that dilute the stock?     Congrats on following along, normally yes. Normally shareholders react negatively to announcements of convertible notes. But PTON is simultaneously buying call options that will accrue value if their common stock gains enough value for the notes to be "in the money".     What's the "strike price" for PTON's convertible notes?     This is called the conversion price. The notes are only worth more than their face value if PTON closes above   $240/share  .   That's 65% upside from today.     How big is the loan?     PTON initially offered $600M of notes with the option to purchase an additional $90M. Clearly there was so much interest in that they expanded it to $875M with the option to purchase an additional $125M.     Is there an expiration date?     Neither party can do anything before 2024, between 2024 and 2026 investors can convert their notes.     What's the interest rate?     Get this, it's   0% interest  .  Let me repeat all that, as it's insane.   The creditors agreed to let PTON owe them $1B for 4-6 years at 0% interest, in exchange for the privilege of converting their investment into PTON shares at $240/share in 4 years.    Meaning who ever is making this loan not only thinks PTON shares are going to be worth AT LEAST $240 in 4 years, but above $240 enough that this will beat inflation and any other safer investment they could make with that money.     What's the significance of PTON using call options?     They state in their 8-K that   they expect the option counterparty (the seller of the call options) to purchase PTON common stock to hedge their position, concurrently or immediately after pricing  . Pricing was finalized this morning. This will happen this week. In order to reach a delta neutral position the option counterparty has to purchase a lot of shares. How many, I don't know, depends on the delta of the spreads, but since they're buying $70M in call spreads that are $116 wide, I assume anywhere between $50M of shares to something like $150M. That's about \~300k-1M shares. That's a big chunk of the average volume however you cut it.          How to play this?          Buy call options and shares. I am personally going with 6/18 $160c. I will likely roll these 30 to 60 days to expiration as I see PTON as a long term play. You can choose something closer to expiration.  Caveat, the short term play may not work out. If you buy FDs you might lose your money. The counterparty may do an OTC transaction that gets reported at a later date. I don't really know how any of that works, and you're reading a non-professional's analysis.  If you buy longer expiration options or shares, even if the price doesn't go up this week, it will go up eventually.  ## LONG TERM BULLISH STUFF  This is going to be a subjective argument. As a general piece of advice, reading random laypeople's number crunching on the internet is not going to serve you well. I'm being honest with you that I've neither put in the work nor am I qualified to be estimating future earnings or giving you a price target.  That being said, I have some financial advice for you: PTON is going to the moon       🌕 and you should take a bullish position if you like money.  Yes, I've read all the bearish crap about their financials. The thing is, companies look risky until they don't. I think this one will break out. Clearly lots of wall street institutions think so as well.  ## Fundamentals     Institutional ownership?     70%. Wall Street is bullish af on this.         Why would someone buy a $1500 exercise bike with an ipad?     I mean this in a non-judgemental and nice way but if you don't understand why someone would purchase a $1500 exercise bike, you are probably poor.  PTON really is the first luxury product in this category. They really succeeded in making the product aspirational. People  want  to own this bike. There is a certain Apple like feel to it. It's a class signifier. It says something about the owner. It looks pretty. You can display it in your living room if you want.  It's cheaper than an Equinox membership. Yes you could go to planet fitness for cheaper but you could also drink ketchup for dinner.  If you have the money, it doesn't make sense to skimp too much on exercise equipment. If you're gonna hate your janky bike from AliExpress, you won't use it.  PTON keeps reporting quarter after quarter that   they are supply limited:   they're selling these bikes as fast as they can be made. This is flying off the shelves like Teslas.  Their subscription plan has the lowest rates of churn in the industry.     End of the pandemic?     Your view of the pandemic is short-sighted. The changes in the economy are not temporary, the pandemic really accelerated trends that were already there. I don't expect people to go back to gyms. Lots of people bought exercise equipment during this period, including myself. I hate gyms so much. People stare at you, it's far away, you have to change in public like it's high school.  The experience of hopping on your bike and joining a spin class or doing your own routine is 1000x better. I have become evangelical about how great owning a home spin bike is. Gyms lied to you with their stupid machines, whatever they have at gyms is easily replicated with a yoga mat, a set of  dumbbells and an exercise bike. That's really all your gym needs. Gyms were a flawed concept that relied on making cancellation difficult and making you feel bad about it.     Positions     6/19 160c       Shares         tl:dr;   Some options writer has to buy a million PTON shares this week, maybe. Also long term PTON is the future of exercise and it's going to the moon.    Disclaimer  ; I am long PTON. I will gain money if this goes to the moon.    EDIT:   Please don't downvote people who share bearish views in a polite and reasonable way. It doesn't help anyone to suppress opposing view points. Pic for the thumbnail:
GME shorting explained by an idiot for idiots
Lets say I have 1 apple but John wants 4 apples so I ask Max for 4 apples in exchange that I will give him 6 apples later. John gives 2 apples to Frank and 2 apples to Paul. Paul doesn't want to give his apples to either Max or me rn and instead waits until he can double his apples and gives 1 apple to Sam and 1 apple to Tom. Paul then gives the other 2 apples to John and I'm screwed out of my initial apple.
Can we get back to normal?
I know how big the hype on GME and AMC was/is, but it’s time to get back to normal. What this sub has essentially become is a karma farm for people to post the same stupid fucking meme 1000 times a day. Make a thread for posting GME and AMC info and ban the memes about it. Let’s get back to throwing all our money into random stocks because some asshole who wrote several paragraphs did “DD” on it. Enough with the “ApEs ToGeTheR StRonG” and talking about how you’re still diamond handing GME. This isn’t r/pics where you tell us how your GME gains literally saved your moms life because you were able to pay for her new asshole after her previous rectum was destroyed by Tyrone after a night on the town. This is a place to gamble, so stop with the posts saying “I’m very worried about the young investors and the risks they’re taking” fuck off. This is a lair of degenerates and autists and we either make a bag or long $ROPE. It’s time for the new members to learn
False prophets and the sqouzen squeeze
At first we heard we were going to the moon.  Then we heard last week the gamma squeeze was going to happen.  Then we heard last Friday an Infinity squeeze was going to happen.  Then we heard today we’d get updated numbers that proved the short squeeze was coming.  Now people are saying Friday this week is the day.   Face it y’all. The squeeze is done.   Wall Street hedge funds are going to profit off all you  🤚 at this point. The only people getting hurt now are the every day folks who got in late.   There is no shame in selling at a loss. Take whatever is left and invest it in the next gamble on WSB.   Obligatory this is not financial advice. This is my personal opinion. I could always be wrong.
Kevin O'Leary is making a $10k YOLO
This isn't GME. It's Sony SNE DD, Console Cycle, undervalued blah blah rockets
Hi Autists, I need to share this with you or it will sit on my computer and gather dust.  It is trading at a P/E of 15, which is very low compared to its peers, and due to the console Cycle its Revenue is \ Literally\  \ Autistically\  about to rocket.    Look at this pretty picture. It's got a gold heading because it's about to  print.         Sony's most recent Game Developer acquisition is  insomniac games   which includes spider man, Ratchet and Clank ❤️, Spyro ect ect.     Sony's Aim is to get everyone on their ecosystem, and once that happens they win the game. In a year that price to earnings could decrease due to the increase in their earnings, at which point they will become severely undervalued.     PS5s are being sold at a loss, because the game is in the ecosystem now. Once people are locked in, they start printing cash boys. What am I saying, they are already printing cash.     Other than the gaming printing money shop. They have some other neat businesses:           Here some notes for the real nerds:  Sony's biggest segment (in revenue) - Game and network services. which include PlayStation consoles and Software sales (games). Operating magin around 12%  Next biggest in terms of revenue is their financial services. Operating margin of around 13% and growing steadily for the past 6 years.  Semiconductors - Swings wildy, actually only 11% of total revenue but has done well on the back of the semiconductor shortage.  Music - Sony signs hugely popular artists, operating margin at a solid 17% average.  Pictures - Sony pictures is huge, and owns really popular brands, but only comprises of 8% of the companies operating income. Operating margin a rough 3%.     Have fun fellow degenerates.                                                                            TL;DR -             Position $6000 at 100
$F YOLO update. Another analyst upgraded to buy with $14 price target
Joe Biden thinks oil is destroying the world- So I'm buying
alright, well I'm a big fucking oil guy so hang in here.  Oil got crushed March 2020 due to corolla virus and went negative for first time. I started putting money into Levered ETF's (GUSH, NRGU) around this time and have seen some pretty good returns but the best is yet to come.  Keystone Pipeline is gone which brought gas from Canada all the way through the US (the pipeline would be carbon neutral) which was putting the US on a path to gas/oil independence from the Middle East. This will push the demand of gas to the Middle East where there is basically no regulations on how the oil is treated - but hey were trying to save the earth!! This shift in demand from local gas/oil to the Middle East will drive oil prices back up. Strap in retards.  Dont be retarded, Oil is not going anywhere. Most countries are still using coal for energy - which charges those super clean electric cars!
Tilray baby!! Smoke it up!!
IWM Calls looking like super tasty tendies: Super Short DD
IWM is a small cap ETF THAT HAS BEEN MOVING LATELY. We all know small caps make movement very possible with volume and lately there seems to have been a lot of interest in small cap securities.      Specifically, IWM averages 20% growth every year. Current movement:  3M:     1M:     1W:     1D:       Now lets get into call pricing:   2/12 245c are wildly cheap. 7% to strike. $.01-$.03   2/19 260c are also cheap af, but 14% to strike, with a little more time. $.01-$.03     In this volatile climate, it pays to be an absolute idiot.   What I'm saying is, recoup some losses here you diamond handed bastards. I've learned so much from this incredibly degenerate corner of the internet, and this is my first attempt at offering something back. Don't go fucking crazy because I'm literally an idiot and not a physical therapist, so don't over stretch on this one.

Daddy's DD of the week: $BB
So i've been doing some research on certain companies and have been doing well on the one's i invest. This is my first DD so let's see how it goes!  Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.  So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, "meme stocks" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.  I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)     Here we see, " ."     For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.  As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.     I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.  Whether this is short or a long term play, I LIKE THE STOCK!    if this goes well i would like to start doing weekly DD's
Here's an update on which tickers were mentioned the most in discussion yesterday
Plausible explanation for the GME situation
Let us imagine companies A and B are in the same industry but politically divergent, for example Wind vs Coal, or in our case, GameStop vs Amazon, perhaps.  Wealthy investors C and D are politically aligned to B (Coal).  Investor C buys a long position in A, then loans out its shares to investor D with no intention to ever sell.   Investor C reinvests the interest received from this lending into B.  Investor D sells the loaned shares to new investors E, F, and G.  Investor D uses the proceeds from the sale to pay off the loan interest then reinvests the remainder elsewhere or into Company B. Investor D is under no pressure to cover as they have a mutual agreement C will never sell.  Now in this simplified example, consumers EFG believe they are investing in their aligned interest, Wind, but in fact, the money is being immediately redistributed to Coal.  All legal and above board, right?

(2/9) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News
#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday morning-         #           > # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak  >     stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February’s blistering gains ahead of Tuesday’s trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly  ,   and 7%, respectively.         > # 2. Trump’s second impeachment trial to begin in Senate  >   Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month’s deadly riot at the   Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1   ET.         > # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs  >   Raising the federal minimum wage from $  per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost   million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden’s $  trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.         > # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‘most likely’ path of coronavirus  >   An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a “work in progress,” but the “most likely” pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as “extremely unlikely.”         > # 5. Reddit’s valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding  >   Reddit — ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania — raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer — which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week — dropped another   on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday’s premarket.         #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(            #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(            #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(            #YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS: ######(            #TODAY'S S&P SECTORS: ######(            #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(            #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(            #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(            #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(            #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(            #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(            #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(            #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(    ######(    ######(            #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(            #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(    ######(            #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(  source:           >   Coty (COTY)   – The cosmetics company reported quarterly profit of 17 cents per share, 10 cents a share above estimates.

Yearly revenue up about 58%. But that's not even the main draw for me.     THE BEST PART    They are expecting nearly   $2 billion   in revenue for 2021. And the current market cap is $  billion. They are literally trading at only about twice the 2021 revenues. Which is the cheapest valuation for a company growing at this rate.    For such a small market cap stock, CRSR is an absolute steal   And they are profitable quarterly and yearly! Planning to launch a bunch of new stuff this year.   Potential acquire target which will sent them over 40% up overnight.  The stock will double in no  !       TLDR: BUY and don't sell for under 70      Positions: 900 shares. Plus 10 $60 calls

Trading advice all cancels itself out
Always take profit!!    but also add to your winners.  Sell a loss quickly!!  but dont panic sell.  The trend is your friend!!  but don't be a sheep and don't fomo.  One or 3 sentences won't teach you how to trade.  Every trade is different.  Nothing but experience can really teach you.  The thing I do like seeing here is how many people actually want to invest for the long term.  Maybe the only sentence that truly works is the one about time in the market.  But dont confuse that with "trading".  Wishing success to all of ya-

Reliable Mediocrity: "Uncertainty You Can Trust" - Trading Week Ending 2/19/2021
Dear Member,   Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Reliable Mediocrity newsletter for the trading week ending on February 19th? We hope that this email finds you well and not completely dead from last week's weed stock boom. For those of you who haven't figured it out yet, don't go in on a stock when it is already massively outside its moving averages. While we are on that note: I would not (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE) pulling out gains from C C the Fourth, MARA, and RIOT to balance your earnings. While all three may continue to rise, always know how much of your unrealized gains that you are willing to lose.  I note this because last week was an absolute smoke show. If you believe in the long-term adoption of Voldemort, keep your RIOT and MARA because they will likely dominate the next couple years. From last week, if you followed along and pulled your plays, you definitely cashed in big time.     RIOT +76%   MARA +44%    C C the Fourth +15%    CVS    This week, we are going to be looking into some of our earnings plays that could give us a solid pop leading into announcements. Personally, I believe the meme stocks are dead and that earnings are going to be our plays for the next few weeks until there is notable news coming out of new sectors. If you don't want to get off the meme stock bandwagon, be prepared for some massive roadblocks. Large institutions are riding the waves of meme stocks to cash in. Do you really think that retail investors have the money to move TLRY from $28 - $64 in one week? Of course they don't! Big money hops in with major cash looking to get a quick buck. They buy at $32, it pumps, and then they dump it all for a fast guaranteed profit. Are marijuana stocks going to rise through the Biden presidency? YES! But there won't be any movement that fast (time) and significant (% change) in an organic way.     ACB Long Hold 1/21/2022 ($25 Strike)         I believe in weed stocks for real. I do NOT believe that last week was anything to realistically expect in the future. If you want to make big bucks in weed, you need to pay for the Theta! There is no guarantee on when federal legalization will occur, but we all know it's coming with so many states already legalizing recreational marijuana. I chose ACB because they're a stable business who has an extremely volatile stock. If they can return to their 2018 highs, we are going to cash in massively.       NOTE: The TLRY + APHA merger is tempting, but buying APHA in hopes of cashing in on the arbitrage (83-86% of TLRY depending on who you believe). The risk for APHA is obviously that the TLRY price drops near merger and absolutely screws your play. That being said, APHA is currently trading at   of TLRY so the numbers are on your side if the merger happens in the near future. I have a feeling the merger won't happen until 4/20 at the earliest. You think I'm joking, but imagine the news that would create; "Weed stonks merge on the most sacred of all days!"   ARKF (Yes, specifically Fintech)         RIOT and MARA have been crushing lately, but they're just one component of the financial technology future. The real financial future will be diversified between "normal" fiat currency technology becoming more simplified through cloud based payment systems and digital wallets in general. The digital wallet market has just opened up and this can be seen through the success of Square, Apple Pay, Shopify, etc. When the general population as a whole transitions to these, which will happen, the fintech market will absolutely explode. Is ARKF a one week play, absolutely not, but it's almost guaranteed to continue its meteoric rise.       My play is HEAVY in shares. The premiums for 1/21/2022 options are about +$10/share ATM and +$5/share OTM at +43% of current trading price. Depending on what your goal here is, I'm going to say that shares are probably both safe AND a good investment for the future.       Worth noting: ARKF is up 44% in the last 3-months. If you're willing to gamble on that to continue, those 1/21/2022 $85 strikes are gold.    CCL 3/12 ($  Strike)         Carnival Cruise Lines is boring as hell, there is no denying this. It's time that we finally admit that we all want to be in on the return of cruise lines. Where are they going? Up. When is the question. I'm going a month out and here is why. Dr. Genius Fauci says it will be "open season" for vaccinations of the general public by April. The reason I'm looking at 3/12 is because people are going to start hopping on the stock given the future expectations. If Fauci's promise is delivered in April, it will be open season for cruises again this summer. Can we make another play leading into June/August, for sure, but the cost of Theta right now looks a bit steep.       Next, why $  I'm shooting here because CCL hit $  for absolutely no reason in early December and only pulled back to around $20. We were heading into all time highs for cases in the US and we all knew it was only going to go up through the holidays. Next, if you've been watching the news, you have seen the MASSIVE decline in new cases occurring throughout the US. This is a massively huge moment for all travel and leisure related companies. But most of all, massive for cruise lines. This makes it VERY likely that CCL will "cruise" its way back up to $23-$24. If you want to be safe, hit that $  mark.       As always, don't exercise your options. Also, if you're up 50%+ just cash out and move on to the next play. Know your numbers and risk accordingly.    ZNGA (Just hear me out!) 1/21/2022 $20 Strike         ZNGA has been recommended as a "Best Buy" through MF on multiple occasions. The hype of that alone is enough to keep it rolling for months to come. The MF followers buy and hold for long periods of time.  ZNGA is a massively successful mobile gaming company that is up   on the year. They recently announced they would be moving into multi-platform gaming to diversify their gaming experiences. ZNGA makes most of their money from micro-transactions that are small and frequent. They have shown that they are going to control the majority of the mobile gaming market.       For the record, this might hit, it might not hit, but the cost is only $  at current position. I'm looking to play a bunch of these and pull out around +75-100%, just keeping a few in hopes of a big OTM - ITM play.    Notable Mentions (More dangerous given their recent success)         C C the Fourth - This guy is still a total toss up. I'm pulling some of my shares because if the acquisition doesn't happen, I'm not willing to risk it all. That being said, I'm going to hold 20-ish on the off chance of a meteoric rise post-acquisition.       RIOT & MARA - I truly believe in the technology here and I will continue to hold unless there is some sort of massive ban on their technology. Also, multiple large institutions have stated their interest in acquiring large sums of Voldemort for free cash holdings, similar to Tesla's action last week. If this occurs, RIOT and MARA will continue to explode.   Sincerely,   Lehman Brothers' Risk Management Department     Watch CVS and PLTR cause they're about to pop, but it's too late for you.
Some DD on TLRY/APHA since none of you seem to get it
All prices listed in USD. Using the US tickers. Holding 500 shares of APHA, not giving advice just putting out details.  Prices at time of writing:      TLRY   -        APHA   -       Background:   Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down.      Current Catalysts     Merger:  Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get   shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.   Arbitrage gap:  Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the   share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $     Market share/Cap:  The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.    Future Catalysts      Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon    Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one    US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming    US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level    Stupid Questions I keep seeing      No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now    The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company    If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get   TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math    Yes they can still run, they are undervalued compared to CGC and the US market is bigger than Canada, UK, and Germany combined.    Yes they can still drop. If I knew for certain it was going up I'd have more than 500 shares and be much less poor    TLRY could drop to close the gap, or APHA could rise. No one knows which will happen. APHA is likely the safer play at this point, as it is cushioned by the gap in share price.     This is not financial advice. It is just some things I thought you would like to know

The End of the Telcos
Everyone take a look at the following stonks:   Verizon, Centurylink, AT&T, Frontier Communications  None have increased in price since 1999. Only Verizon is near its peak in 99; AT&T is half the price it was then. Centurylink is 1/5th the price. Frontier is 1/500th the price.  All of these companies have something in common: They all own Bell's old wireline assets. And they've done nothing with them. For the twenty five years or so they've held them.  These companies are, collectively, the biggest service providers for rural "broadband" (it's an oxymoron) in the United States. They are also all reporting dwindling landline subscribers year over year, due in large part to the poor service and poor price point for a service that no longer works as well as it once did, due to crumbling copper infrastructure and failed (and/or refusal to commit to) fiber replacement.  Verizon and AT&T have both offered very substantial dividends for years (and received hundreds of billions in taxpayer subsidy) as opposed to reinvesting those billions of dollars into necessary upgrades to infrastructure and maintenance. They have also reported consistent layoffs of technical personnel in every passing year. I suspect Centurylink and Frontier have reported the same. Great way to pad balance sheets in failing companies!  Now, Verizon and AT&T both own wireless systems; Verizon being the self-proclaimed 'largest nationwide provider.' But there's a problem here for both of them. T-Mobile is blowing them out of the water in urban areas with faster speeds and truly unlimited data, and in rural areas, where they have a stranglehold, the ROI is not very good. To make matters worse, competitors like Starlink, and later, OneWeb and Project Kuiper, are coming online and the telcos are not prepared to compete against them in their rural regions.  The fact that both AT&T and Verizon attempted (and more or less failed) to move into the media sphere with acquisitions over the years seems to imply they weren't very interested in staying telecommunications companies. In fact, I believe their goal, long term - and there are articles supporting this out there - was to let the old ATM/copper network rot completely, and become solely wireless companies. No more unlimited data landlines, no more telephone subscribers. That's a much bigger chunk of their current revenue than people may realize.  If these companies keep losing ground in urban areas, they will face insurmountable monetary challenges in the next decade due largely in part to their own hubris. They figured wireless would be the solution to everything, but as it turns out, if you don't run fiber to the farmland, wireless might as well be dial-up.    tl;dr   The telcos are quickly running out of time and resources to make up for their mistakes over the last twenty years. If they don't act soon, it will be lights out.

Don't waste a Bull market holding until you break even
Look. Are we in a bubble? 100%. There is no doubt that equities are in a huge bubble that will keep being propped by the money printers in the DC and Bussels. So why waste it hoping to go from -10% to 0% profit?  There's a little thing called opportunity cost. Selling at a loss sucks, but it can be the profitable move. If you hold a stock because it's at a loss until it hits X in Y months you will likely have less money than if you sell now, re-invest it and hit 30% on whatever you know is going up (weed, TESLA, renewables, online gambling, pretty much anything except treasuries right now). The opposite of diamond hands is hoping to break even.      Gambling is ok. Wasting potential gains isn't.
The Legend Of The Stock
How to go from a Virgin GME Ape into a Chad GME Investor on WSB
GME gang, we've got an image issue, and I've come to realize that while GME may be a good investment depending on what DD you choose to listen to,  you  are the biggest problem GME has.  Are there bots and shills here? Undoubtedly there were, maybe there even still is. At most I think 10% of the participants are/were bots or hired trolls. But what those guys do most is  the worst we have to offer on either side of this stock to set the tone. After that ball is in motion the shills and bots and trolls could walk away and we'd keep burning for weeks.  Consider this a social short squeeze. A bunch of newcomers here and give OGs short fuses. Then some outside actors come in and applies leverage to the friction between new and old users. Finally, OGs will squeeze GME holders into becoming social pariahs. And before you know it your own private portfolio has become a badge of shame. Regardless of everything else,  this  squeeze I'm describing  has  squoze.  So what can we do to get back into the good graces of our gracious, yet strained hosts?     Stop being a dork.     Stop clogging the sub with low-effort bullshit   Stop flexing,    Stop acting like a junkie,   "YoU HoLdInG?"   Stop using the wrong fucking flair, (for fucks sake it's not hard!)  And here's what you can start doing instead:    Learn what other people are interested in   Listen in on other DDs for other tickers   Participate in discussions outside of GME, broaden your horizons   Laugh at your own stupid mistakes   Step outside of the GME threads and into others. Integrate with the community  Listen, hold your GME if that's what you want to do. Only you know your current situation and risk tolerances. I'm still holding, but I'm diversifying, and I'll be putting some of my gains from other investments into GME to lower my cost average.   I don't think anyone here really wants you to sell GME. Instead, I think they want you to shut the fuck up about it. At least for now, while it's doing nothing of real interest.  Read and write your own GME DD based on numbers instead of vitriol. If and when GME flies again, be cool about it. Be quiet about it. And post the biggest fucking gains this sub has ever seen.   Mods, I think we can get rid of the GME daily threads for a while. They currently only attract trolls and weak minded people who need constant reinforcement. I think it's time GME gang learns to stand on the merits of their own investments instead of huddling around each other like penguins in the long dark antarctic winters.   Positions:    AMC:  2/12  ,       TLRY: 2/12 42C     PRPL: 2/19 45C     BB: 2/26       GME: 27 shares @ $195     AMC: 10 shares @    Edit: Because someone asked for proof of positions:     And before anybody else asks, yes I'm moving to Fidelity from Robinhood.
A case for Corsair(CRSR)
Ok I’m getting sick and tired of seeing posts with numbers so I’m going to break it down for you retards. Corsair specializes in computer accessories. Tons of them use RGB which is red green and blue led lights to make us gush and cream our pants. Keep that RGB in mind now your colorful autists.    R - This morning they announced massive earnings and in true fashion the stock immediately went in the Red for the day.  G - mid morning seems to have found the floor and now the stocks turning back towards the green side of things.   B - let’s never forget what color is associated with our favorite lunar body. That’s right baby, blue moon of Kentucky. This is a no brainer to me.   Get in now before this bitch flies to the moon.   I’m in for 4 $50 march19 calls. I’m a poor person. This is not financial advice.
I believe I have found lotto FDs (and other puts) that will actually print. DoorDash is about to collapse, and this is your opportunity to bank.
Disclaimer: It is moronic to buy FDs. That is not the way to consistently build wealth. The very reason FDs pay off such huge returns is because on average their probability of expiring worthless is 99%. If you’re moronic enough to buy FDs with me, only do it with money that you are willing to literally set on fire. Actual fire. There are plenty of safer puts on DASH that will pay obscene returns this year. .           TLDR: I believe DoorDash (DASH) is the greatest short opportunity of the year, and what’s more, rather than just having a general feeling, there are specific timetables enabling us to profit bigly. The company even admits themselves that they have peaked as a company.            # Analysis:      >“Food delivery with third-party apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats is booming, but no one's making money.” – Business Insider.          DoorDash is wildly overvalued. This is true by any metric, were it in essentially any industry. Add to that its in food delivery, which is a horrific, no margin industry in what has become a commoditized business and offers essentially no differentiation with its competitors.  There is near zero differentiation between Uber Eats, Postmates, Caviar, Grubhub, DASH, or any local provider. In Austin we have Favor, for example. And nobody cares which company delivers their food, they only care which one does it cheapest.           If you view stock (as you should) as buying the entire business as an owner, how much would you be willing to pay for an undifferentiated company in a no margin commoditized business that has peaked (see below for more on that)? Because it’s currently selling for an insane $56 billion. Outrageous.          So how can we get a banana for scale to understand what that $56 billion means in terms of valuation?          Well, all of DoorDash’s competitors have either sold at or are trading at, or raised money at, a capitalization of 3x to 6x sales.   DASH is trading at an absolutely insane 20+ x sales.            Just six months ago   which put it at 4x sales.   At 4x sales, DASH would trade at $32.            DASH used to be the business leader in this industry, but over the past 2-3 years Grubhub has exploded in size to take on nearly the same 33% of market share, and after Uber Eats bought Postmates, it too now has about a third of market share. So you now have three giants of roughly equal size battling it out in a business in which customers don’t give a motherloving frick about branding.          ### But don’t take my word for it on valuation, take smart money’s word           . That is truly a stunning fact. In just a few months the WSB type day trading call buyers have bid this company all the way up to $56 billion from $16 billion without any material change to the business and completely ignoring the coming vaccine-induced reopening of restaurants. Again, the stock trades for a 300% markup to its recent smart money capital raise based on nothing but unfounded hopium.           You don’t have to take my word for it, your beloved Jim Cramer has even said the same thing, in his own idiotic, covering my ass, round about say nothing way. “It’s true that people using market orders took DoorDash to levels that maybe ... were far higher than they thought they’d have paid.” - Jim Cramer          I don’t care about his commentary, but you people seem to love him, so there you go. 😘            ## The Company, according to The Company, has peaked. It’s over.           There are two extremely interesting things buried in the S-1 we’re going to get into in a moment. One of them is that you don’t have to take my word for it that this company’s business has peaked.   The company says so itself in its own S-1.             >The circumstances that have accelerated the increase in Total Orders stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and we expect the growth rate in Total Orders to decline in future periods.          To put it simply, COVID numbers are falling, vaccines are rolling out at an impressive 1-2 million per day which puts our stated goal of 100 million vaccinated in 100 days within attainable reach. The economy will be opening up, people will want to be getting out of the house, restaurants will be reopening, and there will be huge pent up demand by people who have had extraordinarily high savings rates over the last year. Big chains will no longer have the need to get help from third party delivery apps at a 15% markup. We all know this is the case, and DoorDash even stated as much in its own filing. This stock is toast.           >”Delivery via smartphone is one of those venture-funded sectors where business executives appear to have taken seriously the old joke about “losing money on every transaction but making it up on volume.” – New York Magazine           .          ## And Now the Fun Part           There are some wild share lockup expirations coming up. For those that don’t know, when you get these massive IPOs, insiders aren’t actually able to sell their shares on IPO day. They are locked up and the insiders just have to hope for the best that the stock will not lose value over the coming months. If the stock skyrockets in value, but the insiders know the business is trash or has peaked, you get the perfect recipe for a rush for the exits.           I love playing share lockups. I make a lot of money on them by selling spreads. A common question I get when I post them here is “if you know a drop is coming, why doesn’t the market just price it in?” The answer is because it can’t. No matter what the share price does, the lockup expiration date is the lockup expiration date. Insiders have to wait until that date, and it doesn’t matter whether the stock falls 0%, 5%, or 50%, they will all have to wait until that day to sell.           DoorDash has two share lockup expirations coming.           The first lockup expiration is an early release (heh) and hits 90 days after the Dec. 9 IPO, or around March 9, as long as the stock trades 25% higher than the IPO price for five out of 10 consecutive days of trading.  That is to say, so long as DASH trades above $  right before March 9, the lockup is triggered. The good news for you with this insane run up in price is that if the lockup isn’t triggered, it means the stock has already fallen from $190 to $127. It’s important to know March 9 is not a hard date   insiders can be allowed to go a few days prior. Also if they release earnings early the lockup could potentially occur at the end of this month.          I was talking to some folks on WSB about the lockup last week, and someone mentioned they thought only 20% of insider shares will be eligible. DoorDash's management and board members can sell up to 20% of their shares in that first wave, but other insiders can sell up to 40%. This means 113 million shares are eligible for sale in early lockup expiration. DoorDash’s daily volume is only 3-4 million shares. The current public float is roughly 123 million shares. This means you’re about to suddenly double the number of shares on the market.           Door Dash’s second lock-up expiration hits either 180 days after its IPO, which means around June 9 (more or less), or after the release of its first-quarter earnings report (whichever is earlier), and will free up “all remaining shares” according to the S-1, which if my math is correct is roughly 50 million shares.           These two expirations could spark violent sell-offs throughout the year.          ## Positions           ### FDs          I never buy FDs. I’ve never once bought them in my entire life. But I’m putting 1% of my portfolio into them on DASH because I’m confident big drops are coming. Unfortunately for you guys, the stock has already started falling this past month from its 🤡-level highs in the $200s, and worse yet the pricing/IV of all options has gotten more expensive. This means, I’m sorry to say, that you’re not going to find any options trading for pennies, or even anything less than $2. For your FDs, I recommend you buy puts at whatever the lowest strikes are that actually have any volume. The strikes go as low as $75, but most days show 0 volume and of course the bid/ask spread is enormous. There has been some volume at $95 recently, and you can get the $75s if you’re patient enough and willing to pay up for them. Expiration dates would be any time in mid to late March (again, looking for whatever has volume) so that it occurs after lockup 1, and the August 20s, which unfortunately are the closest expiration to the lockup occurring around June 9. I wish there was a closer expiration, but hey, more time for the stock to collapse. Plus you could always sell your puts after the June 9 drop with lots of theta meat still left on the bone.           ### Puts I own March 12 $160 puts. I think the stock will drop healthily below this, but IV is high. I’m normally taking big swings with spreads, so when I buy puts outright, which is rare, I want to play it a little safer.          I also own the August 20 $145 puts.           And finally, I have six figure credit call spreads open at the $175 level. For newbies, this simply means I:     Bought (yes bought) the March 12 $175 calls, and      Sold the $  calls.          I went huge on these because all I need is for DoorDash to trade below $  after the lockup expiration and I’ll be having a Merry Christmas. That’s as close to risk free gains as you’re ever going to see in your life.          ### Bull case     The only bull case is that we’re in a raging, record-setting bull market and all stonks go up. The economy is opening back up, vaccines are rolling out, and stonks go up. But I think if you look at the DASH chart you can see that that is already starting to not be the case.          ### What are the negatives?     I plagiarized liberally  , although it doesn’t even mention share lockups. Yes, that Citron. For those of you who are newer members, I will tell you this; the little smart money social circles in and around WSB do not hate CItron, Hindenburg, or any other short selling firms. We respect them and welcome bearish cases on high flying stocks. Any intelligent trader does. It’s only the pump and dumpers who have a hatred for short reports. You should welcome contrarian views.          ### Parting Words.    I would welcome anyone pointing out where they think I may be wrong. I don’t care about saving face, I care about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it. I welcome constructive criticism.      ## Give Me One More TLDR At The End     This stock is going to collapse because it’s wildly overvalued, employees got in super cheap with shares they are waiting to sell, know the business has peaked, and they want to cash the fahk out. So swallow the high IV and buy puts today as fast as you can.           Love you guys.

If you see this post, and your Robinhood account is still active, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
There’s fucking retarded and then there’s fucking retarded.  Holding an obsolete brick-and-mortar video game store stock as it approaches Tesla-level pricing is fucking retarded, and that’s awesome.    But having that Martin Skreli lookalike cuck at Robinhood literally reach into your wallet and steal the money that your ugly mother earned for you by dropping you on your retarded head weekly for several years knocking your otherwise useless brain onto the retard autism spectrum and setting you up to join this subreddit so you could convert the $1,000 your wife’s boyfriend paid you to wash his car for a year and turn it into $200,000 so you can buy your wife’s boyfriend a new and more awesome is car is Fucking. Retarded., and that’s NOT awesome.  DELETE THAT FUCKING APP YOU GAPING ASSHOLES
HODL for god's sake!
Many people want to sell on the dip now, but we all know we are not getting the full story from the media. Melvin and other hedge funds are pushing the price down, but they will have to buy higher no matter what, once their shorts run out.      When that happens the story will gain media traction once gain, and we will see a boost again.      Buy the dip or HODL; don't go out with losses now!
Is everyone aware the Short Interest report is from the Jan 29th SETTLEMENT Date, not Jan 29th Trade Date?
I know a lot of people are still holding out hope for this report to save them or re-ignite momentum.  Just before it does come out I wanted to check that people understand what it is reporting.  The Settlement date of a stock is T+2, basically 3 business days.  So Just so everyone understands, that means the only thing you'll see is trading up to January 27th.  So up to that moment it had not actually hit the highest point, which occurred on the 28th, and for many firms they'd only receive their margin call after the close of the 27th, not during the day.    So I'm just putting that out there, control your expectations and think ahead about what you expect to hear before it comes out 'cause i think emotional thinking will overwhelm some people at that point.  It is extremely likely you will still see a very high short interest, likely still over 100%, possibly even higher than   please be aware that this is BEFORE the price maxed, that a large percentage of those companies will have had to close their positions the very next day when the stock tripled in value, but that will not be reflected   specific hedge funds everyone is completely obsessed with also claimed to close their positions after Wednesday. This report is as of Tuesday, you will not be able to use it to confirm a conspiracy theory that they lied.  So do with the information what you will, I still expect some people to weave it into conspiracy theories, but at least know what the information in terms of the dates it covers.  EDIT: This applies obviously to the other stocks too. If you still really look forward to the report go read the old ones at FINRA so at least you understand what you're going to be getting
Tanker Stocks are Smooth Sailing
Sea shanties are hot in the streets. And while we're still waiting for our rocket ship to take off with GME, we can still explore the ocean. Which by the way is still like 95% unexplored, but thats a story for another time.   Theres another reason to be a little bullish on oil tankers, however. With Biden cancelling the Keystone Pipeline, a lot of our national oil needs are left unmet. The green fuel revolution is still a ways off. We still need oil. But we're just gonna need to get it from other places. Thats where the tankers come in. They've had a little bit of a rough year, but who hasn't. They're also underbought. Thats why I like these stocks. And so do a lot of the institutions. They're not shorting it either, they're holding. These stocks have great value right now and they will until renewables and EVs take over a larger segment of the market, if they ever do.   I am not a financial advisor, just another autist who has absolutely no idea what the fuck they're doing. But I am ready to go in heavy with the roughnecks. I love seamen and I love these stocks!
Monkey Poker
Yea so the retail squeeze was/is a wild ride.    Those of you getting bent about if it's over or not clearly do not understand how the game is played, but props for trying to learn.  It's never over, stonks go up and stonks go down, every fucking day.  The object of the game is to buy a yacht before you go broke.  If you are losing your ass, this is a good time to google the term 'hedge'.  In the meantime, let me share what I have learned after many losses.  If there is one thing that big bank accounts enjoy more than manipulating us retail traders, it's manipulating each other.  Us retail monkeys are the side show.    Sure it's fun playing poker with your wife's boyfriends little brother because you know you are going to win.  But that is not where you make your money.  You make your money at the casino sitting across the table from a bunch of other drunk high rollers with money to burn.  It's pretty safe to say there are some 10 figure bank accounts circling the drain right now looking at fails-to-deliver data and bargain prices with their mouths watering getting ready to checkmate the fuck out of their competition before they even know what happened.    It's also safe to say that nobody cares if you sell it now or pass your shares down to your wife's boyfriends grandchildren.  This place is not here to tell you what to do, it's here to put people's heads together and get some other opinions about how retarded you are so you can make your own decisions.  We are not trying to beat them, we are simply taking our seat at the table. And also trying to buy a yacht.
Wash sale? Sofi app takes money because I bought BB again from a loss. Wt..
Few weeks ago, I sold BB at a bit of a loss(~50 shares) and yesterday I bought some more - like 50shares at $13/share on Sofi app.  This morning I check Sofi, and see that my average cost for BB went to over $17/share for no apparent reason!  Sofi rep tells me it's because of a Wash sale rule where they just randomly take money from my acct when a stock I took a loss is bought again within 30 days??  Wtf?  Is this real?  Edit:  Sofi did not take money from my acct.  Instead, overall amount is same - still a brain fuck for experiencing this for the first time!
PROOF that GME is not a sell off but short attacks
Check the nasdaq daily short volume data. GME was shorted 77% of the volume yesterday. Short attacks and not a sell off. Don’t confuse daily short volume data with short interest data which comes out tonight and twice a month.  Go to the official government site here     Click on NASDAQ (includes The Nasdaq Stock Market, Nasdaq BX and Nasdaq PSX markets)  it'll take you to     and go to Access Options -> Short Sale Data Files  It'll take you to this     This proves that the drop was mainly shorting and not selling. Check last week and you’ll find the same proof.     Edit: A reminder that this is my opinion and not financial advice. I'm not recommending anything. Look at the data yourself and come to your own opinion.
The only "shorts" I have are the ones I took it in.
Got in too late, took it dry. And yes I bailed on AMC and GME because when a ship is sinking, you don't go down with it. Get in lifeboat and live to fight another day. I'd rather have 50% of my investments than lose 100% of them.   Some of us do invest to make money and don't give a shit about "sticking it to the hedge funds". We aren't "sticking" anything to them. Wall Street will always beat us because they have ALL the money. They manipulated millions of people into investing their savings, and laughed their asses off watching it happen. Some of them in this very sub.   If you lost, lick your wounds and let this be a learning experience.  Edit: So many people in denial. At least you'll have a good story to tell your grandkids about that time you were rich for a week.

Interesting options activity: hitting the highest strikes in a very big way
You can take a look at the ticker on your own.   Disclaimer: very high IVs on everything on the option chain. This was one of the memestonks from the GME era, which drew down very quickly. For those interested, short % of float is around 33% so this is not going to be a GME squeeze.   Not going to talk about politics either because yes that is a major factor. You can go to plenty of other boards to see when Kamala will make the special agriculture ~~mandatory~~ legal. There are much better other stocks within this green ecosystem, but don't show this kind of massive inflow into the highest strikes (so lots of pent up demand, which in turn should drive the delta and gamma higher).   So here it is. For the non-YOLO July 2021 and Jan 2022, the $4 strike (33% higher than the $3 which is a big jump) is getting around 5-6x of the volume today. Similarly on the OI, there's a lot of people buying.   Yes, once higher strikes on chain are introduced, there might be a drop in interest in the $3 and $4. However, that's not to say there will be even more demand for the cheaper $5s and higher strikes, once again driving the gamma machine.      Positions: $3 and $4 July 2021.

Well, this is what my wife's boyfriend told me to do
Petitions to Congress to make sure the Board of Directors are aware of our requests and add a bit of pressure.
For the lazy brained ape:  Send a text message to 50409 and say "sign pvhvip".  There is a House Financial Services Committee coming up on the 18th at 12(noon) EST regarding this mess.  Lets pressure them to make sure they get acknowledgement that they are aware that their shareholders have been requesting this.   I'll add more letters and I'll update the list if you DM the letter you want.  It's easy once it's all setup.  What is this?    will gather your information privately via text or telegram and will find your local Representatives and Senators along with their contact information and send a letter on your behalf to them or give you their phone number to call. This bot will also give you the option to send a copy to your local newspaper editors.  This works. I’ve used it for other petitions and believe it or not, my Representatives and Senators have responded back to me on issues I have signed and had a letter sent on my behalf.    Petitions:   AMC - Sign PKOMXL    GME - Sign PVHVIP    Telegram Resistbot (AMC Link - GME Link) Text 50409 (AMC Link - GME Link)  If you can’t click the links, just manually text 50409 or telegram Resistbot and say “Sign PKOMXL” or “Sign PVHVIP” or whatever petition it is you want to sign.  You can sign them all if you want.  (I guess reddit doesnt allow SMS or Telegram links, you'll have to initialize it manually, the bot will do the rest)     AMC letter you will be sending says: I am writing this petition, requesting as a Share Holder in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. That Congress ask The Board Of Director’s to call an Emergency Shareholder Meeting. It is clear that the numbers that we have been receiving from multiple outlets as well as Brokers pertaining to Short Interest, Shares Outstanding, and Free Float are different from each other.  1.)

We are seeing different numbers of Free Float Shares Being reported by different Brokers and Stock Market Websites.    as Shareholders request that Congress ask if the AMC Entertaintment Holdings Inc Board of Directors are ignoring the thousands of requests from their shareholders to call an Emergency Meeting and rectify these discrepancies.

Any advice for someone in debt who wants make a quick buck with stocks?
Seeing how well the game stonks went, any advice for making some quick cash in stonks? Got 30k in debt I want to pay off from medical bills. To bad I wasn't paying attention on here with the gamestop thing. I have a friend who is a stock guy for people but he doesn't really give me any advice. Which I don't blame him given he spends all day doing stocks and doesn't want to give away any secrets. Recently told him bankruptcy is my only option now unless I can find some quick cash. He didn't seem to care. There has got to be some way to make some sort of good money in a short time period when it comes to stocks.
The 2 larger goods GME has done
Ignoring everything money-wise that's happened with GME the past week, month, and year I believe two very simple things have happened that are as valuable as any investment necessary to obtain it.   1. Wall st is dirty and will do ANYTHING to stay in control, no matter the moral or ethical transgressions. Duh, we knew how messed up they are but GME has brought it all to center stage. The financial paradigms are shifting for the better.   2. Secondly and related is commoner interaction. Wealth inequality is real and only 45% of Americans own stock. This   has no doubt moved that percentage up. Whether it's Mark Cuban's son or reigniting stock interest myself more people are playing the game. The game often reserved for fat cats. This is the most beneficial and largest organic educational series I've seen since Pokemon GO single handedly lowered the Body Fat Percentage of chubby kids across America.  But hey I'm no philosopher nor financial adviser. I just like the stock along with a lot of other people. Power to the players.
My toughts on AMC
To start off, im not a financial advisor or anything of the sort. But i honestly believe looking at the pre pandemic stock rates from AMC that they Will peak like crazy once this pandemic is over. I personally Will not sell even for a cent of loss, and i think it Will hit 30. So best for me is to buy the cheap dip and lowering my minimum profit Line. And possibly we could get a huge profit out of this, but you have to be patient.  link of my loss.
Yesterday, if you followed my advice on TLRY you'd be up 100% in 24 hrs. Today, let’s talk about WKHS & OSK. (xpost r/options)
TL;DR: OSK to the moon    , WKHS to hell 👎👎👎    WKHS is at all time highs, and Reddit loves to pump the stock. Me? I was one of the biggest workhorse bulls with hundreds of shares in my portfolio. I rode the wave until today, where I sold the last of my shares. So... why?  Well,   90% of this company‘s value is based on them getting the USPS deal. People love to think the company is a shoe in for the USPS deal, but that’s simply not the case.    For starters, the Biden administration doesn’t have nearly as much control over the United States Postal Service as you think. See:   Even if Biden‘s number one goal was for the USPS to go all electric, he’d have to move hell and earth to have any control over that happening. And, with the contract supposedly being decided by the end of March, there simply isn’t enough time to do that.  But it gets even worse. People say “well, workhorse is the only all electric option, so at least it has that going for it.“ To that, I Bring you a conversation an analyst had with Oshkosh:  > “Your bid is based on the Ford's transit, I believe. And we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021. For your comment that you can address whatever the USPS' needs are as far as powertrain, is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit? Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?”  Oshkosh’s reply:   > “So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.”  In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all-electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special.  Let’s get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed).   Buy mountains of WKHS puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you’re brave like me, calls expiring in April.    DISCLAIMER: I am a certified moron and what I’m saying is not financial advice. If you follow my advice, you are also a certified moron. In fact, do the opposite of what I say. I dare you. Good luck with that.

Question of ownership
If I buy stock via RobinHood or eTrade, do I actually own the stock, or do they (the service I used) own the stock and just have a marker with the equivalent value in my account?   Like a bank deposit.  I mean, if I tell RobinHood I want to buy zzz stock and instead they just pocket my money and set a calculator to show me what I should have and then RobinHood uses my money to invest in some other venture.
Even the smallest shareholder can change the course of the future - PART 1
Get prepared for a downvote brigade and post/comment removals!
With the small spike in GME (and AMC to lesser extent), it's clear that people are anticipating short interest is still going to be high. Whether or not that will be the truth (or even if the FINRA numbers will be reliable) is another story.   Regardless, the astroturfing and narrative control efforts will be strong, especially if the SI numbers ARE high. For now, just wait, buy, and hold if you're confident in GME. Not financial advice.  Position: 60@77 GME   Edit: Also, SI numbers have NOT been updated yet, so just be patient. 6pm EST seems to be the "expected" time. Those people linking or saying   SI are wrong, those numbers are not updated and are old.  Just be patient folks. As has always been since the beginning of the GME ventures, there's a lot of money to be gained or lost on either "side", so just remain vigilant use your logic (not emotions) when deciding to buy/sell/hold.
Does anybody wanna talk about what the fuck just happend with SPY?
SPY volume was a fucking  third  of what it normally is today. And for being that low it sure was bouncing around quite a bit. Also right at the end of the day there when that dump happened volume shot up from 25mil to 35mil in less than 5 minutes. every single option bled today right up until the end of the day. Doesn't that usually happen when big institutions are trying to hide the fact that they are switching to the short side? I also noticed for the last hour of the day even tho the ETF was climbing steadily so was the VIX and now right after close that fucker looks like it's moving up at a 90 degree angle.   know that the sentiment here has been    r fuk for a looooong time but I went all cash today and bought spy puts yesterday at that big run up before close. Did I pull an autismo move and call the top? Or you guys thinking small pullback maybe a couple % then right back on the call train to tendie town? Or I'm a dumb fuck for buying puts becauy stonks go up and timing the market is fucking impossible.  # I WAS RIGHT BITCHES
Fidelity restricting cash buys of GME
I have cash in my account. Initiated small GME buy.  Fidelity error message states not enough cash. This is wrong. Counter move- initiated single share buys at market with cash. Managed to acquire 2 shares. Continued  to initiate single share buys error message states again not enough cash. Screen captured the cash available to trade in account coupled with the ‘not enough cash’ to trade showing the contradiction.   I love the stock .  Edit: I really like Fidelity. Have several accounts with them . Won’t change brokerages.  Edit 2: Odd situation and I’m seasoned  Edit 3: managed buys of total 62 shares today in several fidelity accounts   Did I share I love the stock?
What to use as someone from Europe?
As the title says, what app should i use if i'm European.   I've checked out etorro but that seems to charge for mostly everything.   i've always kept my eyes on stocks & how they work however i ve never dippet into them myself.  Now's the time but it seems that Robinhood is not available in europe.  I don't want to do with through a bank so, fellow people from european countries, what apps do you use for stocks?
The 5-2-3 Strategy: A New Way To Invest
For the last few months I’ve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it’s something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.   One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would  . This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes   to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.   Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let’s take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:  &nbsp;  Here is     Here is     Here is     Also some other big investment things that I can't say on this sub have fallen into the 5-2-3 strategy.  &nbsp;  And finally to another recent stock: GME. In late August 2020   but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.   &nbsp;   Hope you’ve found this interesting, I’d love some feedback and opinions on where I could do better!

When temptation knocks.... HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!!
I don't know if I made the hedgies happy or not, but it brought me relief
I sold 80% of my GME shares. I have 10 left which I'm holding. I got $2,092 out of the 14k I put in.  I don't know if I played the hand they manufactured or if I came to my senses, but I feel relieved. I crunched the numbers and invested in the cruise industry and realised my profits would make up for my loss. As I'm more certain that the cruising industry will rise again more than GME.  Now, if we're being honest with ourselves I put money into GME because I wanted to get rich quick. And then it turned into wanting to "stick it to the man."  Well, I read a post on here that swayed me the other way with logic I just couldn't ignore. It was something along the lines of "if you know you're fighting a battle that's rigged, why not get out and invest in something that has more of a chance?"  That made the most sense to me out of all the other bullshit posts of people trying to get us to sell.  I may have lost 14k, but once the cruise industry gets back in gear and it goes to it's regular value (or higher) then I'll have made 69k in profit (he he). And while I'm not a millionaire, it's still more money than I realistically need and I can always reinvest part of that profit.  Point is, hold if you want, sell if you want. Do what makes you sleep better at night.  Honestly fuck the hedge funds they'll get their karma one of these days. And if it turns out GME goes up, I still have 10 @

BIGGEST ROKU Bull - YOLO OPTION TRADING $500,000 to $18,000,000 AND counting!
I wanted to share my YOLO story with everyone! (images below text):  I like to think I am one of the biggest ROKU bulls around. Despite following ROKU since the IPO, I had missed most of the gains in 2019. When COVID crash came I said to myself if there was an opportunity to get ROKU again I would scoop it up with every freaking penny I could.  I YOLO with just over 500k in options in April 2020. My strategy was to buy 6 month call option contracts so I could weather any storms, and I did right out of the gate between April to June.  Sold my OCT 17 2020 calls which I bought in April on Oct 17 for   million. I YOLO that   million into more 6 month calls expiring in APRIL 2021.  Current market value over $18,000,000 (CAD)  Kicker is - I think ROKU is going to double again this year all day long... I am all in on this play until ROKU is done printing money... Going to 30 million, 50 million then 100 million even if it takes a few years.  Go ROKU!!!  My second batch of ROKU trades acquired on Oct 17, 2020 below.  Disclaimer: \ Obviously\  I am long ROKU. I’m not a financial advisor, don’t take this as financial advice. Always do your own due diligence.

Jon Stewart did an interview with Jim Cramer over The Streets videos. 2008 vs today. Nothing has changed.
If this stuff upsets you, I would suggest watching Jim Cramer's interview when he was on the Daily Show in 2009. Jon Stewart bring up these videos and essentially calls out Jim and the financial news networks for knowing about these tactics and not doing anything to expose it before the 08' recession.

The Importance of VWAP (part 2)
Alright artards, listen up because I'm seeing bullish things.  Last week I wrote a post that looked at the GME chart and various important levels from a volume perspective (and the psychology behind that)  is a follow up to that post.  Here is that original post:     This second post will be short but I just want to highlight one thing. Take a look at this chart below (or your own) and notice how ever since that faithful day when 5m idiots got boned by Robinhood, price has not closed above VWAP (in this chart normal VWAP is orange and white line is anchored VWAP from the top)     For those that don't know what VWAP is go google it, but in short, it's basically a volume weighted moving average that holds a lot of weight for traders and is an indication of where the balance of power lies within a market trend. As I mentioned, price has failed to close above VWAP since the major high two weeks ago. This is an interesting place for the chart right now because it is fighting with the pretty important $50 level. Why is $50 important? I think it's important because most of you idiots got into this trade above $50 meaning that we might have hit max pain on this trade as everyone is in the red. We will just have to wait and see...    TLDR: If we hold $50 and finally manage to close above VWAP (today or tomorrow), then the odds tip in our favor for the party to start again. I'm not necessarily convinced that we are going to see this go over $500 but I think we will see a significant bounce and make a lower high relative to the last peak two weeks ago (say, $150/$200 range). Also, major bullish bonus points if we break above the red downtrend line and hold it as support.    This is not financial advice. Make your own decisions based on your own  'm just trying to educate people on some TA concepts. I took a 40 share intraday position this morning at $  and I plan to swing it through the night if we close above VWAP. If we fail to take VWAP I will be flat at the close.     Update: Just made a convincing move above VWAP on big volume. Its about to retest back into it and if it holds thats good.     Update: and it failed below. I got stopped out on 30 shares already and unless something miraculous happens into the close I will flatten on the final 10.  Final update on the day:  Ok folks, todays close was really interesting. Take a look at the chart below. About 1 hour before close we were above VWAP and then broke under with about 45 minutes left on the day. Then about 15 min before close we started to climb back up into VWAP but rejected. At that point I closed the rest of my position. LITERALLY at the final 30 seconds of the day we spiked above VWAP and closed above. To me this looked more like a weird liquidity quark rather than a convincing trend change but then the after hours action started and   might get interesting tomorrow. Price just broke the downtrend (red line) and is currently testing as support. I put less weight on this price action as its happening after hours but if it holds that trend and holds VWAP in the first 15 minutes tomorrow then I think we see a big green morning.        Back again:  I just want to note that IMO this is the best risk/reward entry point for GME right now. GME closed above VWAP yesterday for the first time since the major peak (granted a bit of a weird close but still got it), then broke, tested, and resumed off of the downtrend support. Then, it fell through VWAP in the AM, held the low of yesterday, and then recovered in a big way. Now it's retesting back down at VWAP (as to be expected). Personally I'm adding here.      like always not financial   your own research and make your own decisions. get that WAP
Tonight’s SI report
Tonight’s report has been built up to be a make or break point for GME. I want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data. Let’s start with what we know about tonight’s report:  1) This report is based on self reported data.   2) The fine for misreporting, if caught, is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover.  3) The data report covers up until the 29th.  So what are the possible outcomes:  1) Data is accurate, HF covered: I believe at this point GME becomes a long play. There is the potential for an acquisition or a turn around/pivot in the business model. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.  2) Data is accurate, HF did not cover: I believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can. This would push up the price pushing more expiring calls ITM and put further pressure on the HF. We would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on. The play is buy and hold.  3) Data is inaccurate: This is the most likely outcome given the money at stake. If it shows they haven’t covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data. If it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call. Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.  In all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action. The only reason to sell IMHO is if you believe GME will go bankrupt.   Ok so I’m going to buy if I can or continue to hold ... what could happen that would turn this around?  1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.  2) If not covered, GME reverse stock split. This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.  3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.  4) If covered or uncovered, significant renewed public interest in GME. A lot more likely if uncovered, but it’s a strange world we live in so I wouldn’t completely rule it out if they covered.  5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn’t already been done.  6) If covered, GME being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price. This would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the GameStop name lives on.  7) If covered, GME makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation.  Obviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape. Full disclosure, I am currently down around 100k in my positions on GME. In my mind, the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesn’t bother me to hold forever or until I win, whichever comes first.     🌕  Edit: The report is supposed to reflect until the 29th.  Update: It appears the FINRA report officially states
Thoughts about starbreeze aka payday publisher?
Payday 3 is going to be develeoped and released in 2023, is this too early to talk about it, is it apeshit to bet on a game for profits?   Price is in krons so market cap is around 140million USD and it was around 50 million USD when raid happened.   These guys saw they need new engine and they are going on Unreal Engine, i believe it is a great potential, they made the whole payday from stripped down racing engine.   There has been heads changing in last years and last DLC's on payday2 were the most successful. Company is not profiting yet their share price rose with the success of DLC's, it was   kron at police raid, 1 kron after things settled down and now pushing high  's. This is %300 with making positive annoucements and a damn DLC.      What you think, does it make sense to bet on a game? Also for their genre i can only see GTA's heists close and GTA 6 does not seem to be releasing soon. Also for 2 year period, this is not an AAA game but a game that lives with addons, will it be short? Can it suck because it will be underdeveloped?  Teacher said: "Please discuss."

APES WHO ARE GIVING THIS AWARDS. BUY MORE STOCKS OF YOUR FAVORITE COMPANY OR DONATE TO CHARITY. I LOVE AUTISM AND ADHD AWARENESS ORGANIZATIONS. EDUCATION IS ALSO GREAT    A potential shill erased all his posts regarding negative sentiment on $GME earlier. I asked him why he had deleted his posts. He hit me with he did not.     This is an obvious attempt at gaslighting, which is a form of unethical manipulation.  Please, be vigilant out there, apes.  A very easy way to spot shills is by looking at their submission history.  Bot accounts or people making accounts to sell will go into subreddits that allow karma farming like WSB and /r/FreeKarma4U delete those posts and act like it's because "they scrub their history". Fuck off.    NOTE   THIS IS AN XPOST BELOW. I DO HAVE A TLDR OF THE FIRST ARTICLE I WROTE THO IF YOU LOOK IN MY COMMENTS    To get you started:                           — It is worth pointing out that once you understand these tactics those who use them start to sound like whiny, illogical, and unjustifiably confident asshats.        Any time you feel yourself start to get regularly dumbstruck during any and every argument with a particular person, remind yourself of these unethical and pathetically desperate tactics to avoid manipulation via asshat.  Also, as someone commented, a related concept you should know about to have the above knowledge be even more effective is Cognitive Bias and the associated concept of Cognitive Dissonance:                 EDIT: Forgot a link.

Say it with   G B. If you are too busy crying about lost tendies and not looking at the $CRSR discount today, you don't deserve money
So you could continue to moan and lick your wounds that you didn't become a millionare in 3 days, or you can sack up and make your money back on a surefire play.  Today $CRSR earnings released. The numbers were killer as they have been all year (I'm not going to dive into deep DD on the earnings report itself as other posts have already done),. Future guidance is conservative but still very bullish.   This stock has everything going for it, yet the price tanked.     Why?    Because its 2021 and every stock is doing the same thing post positive earnings.   Check out  ....earnings call on 1/18, dipped for a day, bounced back to ATH 2 weeks later and climbing fast.   CRSR is currently at the bottom of that curve right now.  Was it an IV crush? Honestly this morning it was more like a bunch of short-selling in expectations of an IV crush followed by a bunch of panicky paper hands.  It's already up 5% on the day's lows  Every $CRSR financial metric is extremely positive, huge gains over last year.  "But but but /u/dontmicrowavecats , are you sniffing glue? The price of CRSR already rose from $36 to $46, the earnings was already priced in. There will be no moon for you."  No, wrong. Why? Because the price was only at $36 due to pressure from the GME squeeze.    Citadel owns 2% of the $CRSR Float. On 1/13, the same day GME rose 57% for the first time, CRSR tanked. CRSR was oversold in direct reaction to GME      So the price tanks from $41ish to $36, starts recovering, then CRSR issues a secondary PO for   million   drops again.   The stock is currently BARELY trading above the previous averages right now. The entire "runup" to ER wasn't a runup at all, but rather an upward price correction to where it should be.  The stock is still undervalued, and currently trading at a big discount. Today and  possibly  tomorrow will be the best day to buy CRSR you will get.  We are likely going to see $60 within 2 weeks, $70+ soon after that.     TL;DR   RGB = Strong Buy. #   Positions:  Long 600 shares avg $39  40 x  $65 3/19 calls
Regarding the upcoming SI report from Finra
EDIT: SHORT INTEREST AT 78% MOON MISSION CONFIRMED STRAP IN BOYS        Hey retards, we are so close to seeing this GME & AMC thing through.  Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.    This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.       How can the report be skewed?    Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?  You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.       HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!   You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.     What does this mean? Hold, despite what the report says. If the report shows high SI, then the hedgies are actually 100% boned and have not even had enough time and/or money to offset that SI number. That's huge. If the report shows low SI, HODL. The big players simply have not had enough volume to cover all their short positions, and are trying to manipulate us into thinking the MOASS was a hoax.  THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I AM A RETARD WITH VERY LITTLE STINKY STONK EXPERIENCE
SNDL This week!
Damnnn, happy I didnt sell at $  yesterday.  Holding it hard!   Up 35% today, 61% this week, 154% for the month.  Plenty of volume to buy and hold still.  Who else is riding the SNDL rocket?   Only a few more days above $  on the market and then this gets real!   Hope some of you are still all about SNDL, I think the ride is just starting to head back up to last years highs! (No pun intended).   Happy trading Tuesday folks!  Edit: DD another  u/-_Ven_-   worked on and posted 2 days ago!     EDIT: Thanks for all the love folks! Stoked to hear theres a lot of us in hard on the jolly green rocket! (ps. I am not a financial advisor, nor should my words be taken as such. I am simply a below average, redditor).
The biggest Weed/Cannabis companies on a rip! It’s not too late to get into one of the biggest and best potentials! What are your weedstock plays?

Inspirational Copypasta for Bagholders
"Real r/Wallstreetbets” only consists of the GME scene and the late 340     scene. What is known by "Bagholders" is nothing but     with questionable real market influence. When people try to argue that stocks like GME won’t moon   , while saying that TRLY will, I can't help not to cringe because they are just as fake wsb as     (plus the pretentiousness). Real wsb sounds ENERGETIC, POWERFUL and somewhat HATEFUL. Fake squeezes are weak, self pity and a failed attempt to direct energy and stonks to the moon. Some examples of REAL SQUEEZES are GME, AMC, BB (the only real long game from the wsb scene) and NOK. Some examples of FAKE SQUEEZES are TRLY, APHA and TSLA GME BELONGS TO DIAMOND HANDS NOT TO PAPER HANDS,     s, MELVIN OR ANY OTHER HEDGIES  /s  edit: hey posers this is a shit post version of the REAL E/MO copypasta (can’t write e/mo because apparently it’s a ticker for some shitty stock)  Tried to post the OC but got flagged by auto mod
The 10 bagger that has been in front of you all along
If you are wondering why the markets closed today, beats me I have no fucking idea. I've decided to take the time to dig into $PLTR with all this unemployment freetime. Im sure most of you retards have seen plenty of DD on $PLTR but I would like to highlight some things I felt were important and give you that sweet sweet confirmation bias you all love. Digging through some documents got my dick so hard and raw from me jerking off like a frantic autistic maniac that I had to apply a coat of lotion so my cock could heal.  You retards have no idea just how big this fucking company could be in 2-3 years. I will be splitting this DD into multiple parts so put on your glasses and helmets and buckle up. Disclaimer: I no longer need glasses because daddy Cohen paid for my lasik. Soon to be Dadio Karp will be paying for a new house, new wife and cybertruck.  \                                          --   Part 1) Contracts contracts contracts...   Do you realize how many fucking contracts this fucking company is signing? Don't even get me started on the renewals.  I'll list a few just to get things started. (This is within a 4 month timeframe, yes 4 months you monkeys)  October 1st, 2020:   Army Research Lab Selects Palantir Technologies Inc. for $91M Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Development  October 2nd, 2020: Palantir Technologies bags $36M IDIQ contract  October 22, 2020: Palantir providing   government with coronavirus tracking software. estimate: $5M  November 18th, 2020 new   Army contract. estimate: $5M  December 7th, 2020: New FDA contract. The contract, to power drug review and inspections, is worth $ , Bloomberg says.  December 21st, 2020: Palantir receives $114M one-year option for   Army's Vantage program.  December 23rd, 2020: Palantir inks 2-year contract for   health services work worth $   Autists, this is 8 contracts in 4 months worth over 300 million dollars.  I know it's amazing, wipe that drool off your face. This company is in its infancy stage, the little retard can barely walk.  Here is a nice little snippet from an oil and gas company that recently partnered with Palantir:  "An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform".    WITHIN WEEKS THIS COMPANY SAVED 57 MILLION USING PALANTIR. Fuck my ass and call Papa Karp Daddy.    \                                             Part 2) Across the great blue ocean   Palantir hasn't even touched the untapped money pit that is foreign countries.  I'm not going into to much detail but take notice all of the contracts thus far have been with companies within America. In one of Karp's interviews he was asked If foreign countries would have access to the the software, his reply "If you are allied with america it is an easy process"  When I heard that red flags went off and im sure your retarded brain is wondering why are red flags going off Mr.  ? Well little retard the software is so fucking advanced that if it falls into the wrong hands it could have devastating impacts. "DING DING DING" THIS COMPANIES SOFTWARE IS THE EQUIVALENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS KARP SAID. Jesus fucking christ do I have to say it again you smooth brained fuck.  \                                          -  Part  3) The Moat   Don't even say snowflake in the comments you retards. $PLTR has no fucking competitors, it is years ahead of any other company thinking about joining the club.  And guess what retard? When a company becomes dependent on a software they keep renewing their contracts. BY THE TIME ANY OTHER COMPANY COMES CLOSE TO PALANTIR THEY WILLHAVE LOCKED IN SO MANY CONTRACTS THAT THERE WILL BE ONLY BREAD CRUMBS LEFT FOR COMPETITORS.

It has several but I personally see the positives outweighing the negative's longterm. If you think this is a 10 bagger in the next week, it's not. I plan to hold for years.  EDIT 3: A lot of you are forgetting the market we are currently in. Tesla has a near trillion dollar market cap based off of hype/musk and how innovative they are.

Unlikely it will be a 10 bagger, but one can dream.
Intro to LEAPS
Thought I'd write up a quick intro to LEAPS (Long term Equity AnticiPation Security) for all you degenerates that have recently joined whilst the markets are closed today for the break. I've been seeing a lot of loss porn lately (generally from shares thanks to a certain gaming company, but also with people losing on FDs), and I feel compelled to at least put this out there to whoever's willing to listen.  Obligatory, this is not financial advice and has been written for informative/education purposes.        1) What are LEAPS     LEAPS are basically standard Call or Put options with long term expiries, by the books anything beyond 3+ months may be considered LEAPS but for me I'll usualy look into 9+ months deep in the money options when looking at LEAPS.        2) How can I make some tendies with LEAPS?     The key benefits to options (let's take long call options as the example) is that they magnify your potential gains through the magic of leverage.   But with these benefits comes some complexities when buying and selling options such as Black Scholes options pricing, the Greeks and the risks that come with the leverage. Given the recent fat gains from some users here you may feel compelled to jump in and do the same yourself either by yoloing into a share or even worse, yoloing into weekly options. The latter being the reason why WSB being as infamous as it is.   The issue with the two methods above, for the ones who like making money, is that 1) Buying shares is expensive and may not give you the fat upside you are chasing or 2) FDs give you that potential upside, but 99% of the time you lose everything you put in as you options dies from theta decay (time value of an option).  I believe LEAPS gives a great middle groud for you bulls out there, it gives you near 1:1 exposure to the underlying asset, minimised outlay and a longer time horizon for both capital gains tax benefits and protection against short term volatility (where you usually get screwed on FDs).      Take AMD as an example, solid stock with good financial and future prospects. We like the stonk.   Consider a scenario where you have $10,000 to invest or   who  you talk to), I want to walk you through each scenario and possible outcomes of the trade.       Scenario 1: Buy FD - $106 Call Feb26 '21 expiry @$40 per contract x 250 contracts (ALL IN)    Options have two things that make up there value, instrinsic and extrinsic value. Since at the time of writing the market price is $ , this option is well out of the money and has zero intrinsic value. All you're paying for is the extrinsic value of option which is the time value and implied volatility (IV) of the option, defined as Theta and Vega in the greeks.   If the price doesn't hit your $106 strike by expiry, you lose your premium of $40 ($  x 100 shares). In the outside chance that it does pump to at or above your strike, depending on how fast it rises, your option will build more extrinsic value (thanks to Vega), but also the intrinsic value will rise as you are in the money.   To simplify the outcomes let's say you hold to expiry because you ain't no paper handed bitch, one of two things can happen:   a) Expire OTM or ATM: Goodbye $10,000. That's   gambled and you lost it. GG    b) Sell ITM:  Welcome to tendy town, let's just you sell ITM the day of expiry when the market price if $108 (+$2 on your strike), since you bought 250 contract your total gain is 250 x 100 shares x $2 profit = $50,000 profit. As you can see, even with this example of a modest +$2 ITM you can make 5x you initial investment. But the liklihood is so very low, hence the cheap buy in.       Scenario 2: Buy LEAPS- $50 Call Jun17 '22 expiry @$4800 per contract x 2 contracts     Since the LEAPS are more expensive, you can only afford 2x contracts, which equates to 200 shares of expsosure (instead of 25,000).   So under the same scenario 1 where the price moves to $108 in a week, your gain will be \~$12 per share since you actually bought so deep in the money, instead of the OTM where delta is tiny). So if you sold your option here you would make a tidy 200x$13 = $2600 from the same price movement.  If the price movement was down, where your FD expires OTM, the LEAP will be fine as you have plenty of time to recovery from the movement.   Fast forward towards expiry, if AMD moves up, so does your option value at the rate of Delta, if it moves down then the maximum risk is the premium you paid at $9600. (where the share price drops to your strike or below).  In the worst case, if AMD tanks and goes to $20, you could opt to buy in at that price @ 200 shares x $20 =$4000, leaving your total cost base at $13,600. So even if you convert to a long term play tou can come out with a lower overall cost base for the same exposure.       Scenario 3: Buy Shares - 200 shares @ $     This isn't an exact comparison between scenario 1 and 2, as the initial investment is $18,700 vs the \~$10k of the options. But it exhibits the point that between the extremes of FD's and LEAPS in the call option world, the initial equity required to open a position that is on par with the LEAPS (and nowhere near the FD's) is enormous.   In this scenario, the payout outcome is pretty much inline with buying leaps, with the leaps paying out slightly less since in the option price you are paying for a small amount of extrinsic value to have the "option" given by the option contract.      In summary:  FD's are basically gambles on very short term volatility, please understand this. The loss porn is great, but I don't want to see people lose their livelihoods.   LEAPS are a great combo for both long term and short term plays, with lower cost based vs shares for the same exposure.
Robinhood rigs chart peaks to increase upward movements.
Robinhood calculates prices - I think we all know this, but they also generate charts after the fact. Today while ETC began to rise it temporarily hit   A moment later it fell to around 16. Soon after it began to rise again, but while the   peak has been visible before, the new peak top was   And sure you can argue it is based on time and the true peak gets rounded off based on intervals between measurements, but this must have a dramatic effect on mindset. Because now,   appears to be almost equal to the previous peak which was actually a   higher. Sketchy stuff.
Is it a bubble or is it not ?
Why I'm long furniture and mattresses.
One of the first things I read about investing is to start investing in an industry you're familiar with.  Welp, I'm familiar with the furniture/mattress industry.  The demand for furniture and mattresses is through the roof right now.  You can verify this yourself if you want.  Go to your local furniture store and ask how long it will take to custom order a sofa (change the fabric/leather).  The likely answer will be 6-8 months.  This is obviously because of Covid.     Prices for furniture and mattresses are rising on an almost weekly basis right now.  This is due to Covid shutdowns at the factories, the stimulus checks being right in the wheelhouse of furniture prices (hmmm, stuck at home and I just got $600-$1200 for "free" what should I buy? A new sofa!), and, believe it or not, a hurricane a few months ago that wiped out foam factories and caused a huge delay in manufacturing.   I'm long PRPL (I know it was a meme stock on WSB for a while, but look at it's gains over the last year).   Long LZB.  They're 7-8 months out for new orders right now (I know this because I still get their "update" emails for retailers for some reason).    And I'm long ~~TSI~~ (edit TSX, whoops).  Tempur-pedic and Sealy merged a few years ago, but they didn't fully integrate their operations until last month.  They actually shut down production of their mattresses in December until Jan 15 of this year so they could optimize their production.  Up until that point, they were essentially operating as two separate companies.  Not anymore.    I'm just sharing what I've witnessed over the last year, and investing in furniture/mattresses has worked out so far, and these issues in the industry don't seen to be going away any time soon.
Investment Warning for Military
Hey, I just figured I should make sure people serving in the US Military are aware that the military policy specifically bans service members from investing in weed companies and ETFs. If you are in the military and invested in stocks related to marijuana, you may be at risk of loosing your security clearance. I am not saying I agree with this policy; nor am I claiming to represent the military in any way. I just figured I wanted to inform everyone who was not aware. Personally I will be cheering everyone from the sidelines; I cannot afford to risk my military career over a stock investment. I am not making any statement on this matter, just passing along the information.
Already regret selling my ~500 contracts of SNDL near close of market today
Has the train left the station!
I'm certain I wont be the first and wont be the last to ask this on here, but did I miss the golden goose? I didnt even hear about the gme counter short sell till it happend, I chickened out of buying a $1000 in tesla stock a year ago and probably a few more opportunities. So did I miss my opportunity?  If not how do I jump in, what sites are good to use to start trading with besides Robin hood as their seems to be some questions as to if they are on the take or not. How do I start doing market research etc.?  If you've read this far you're the real beez kneez.
This Isn't Kindergarten
Exactly what the title says you degenerate, low-functioning individuals. We get it, the only part of your brain that works is the prefrontal cortex. Even then, it's not exactly a top performer. I mean this in the kindest, rudest, way possible.   This isn't Kindergarten,   no one here is "Mrs. Spinelli" here to teach you the ABC's of investing. No one is here to "Tech me how to read candle chart please" This isn't "why squeeze not squoze??" This is not what WSB was designed for. Go ahead, call me a grumpy old man screaming 'get off my lawn' but this is not what it's for.  It's the same reason you don't walk into a bank and ask them to teach you about their security procedures and how to safely secure large amounts of money by yourself, or why you can't go into a casino and ask them "Now, how exactly does the probability of these games work and how can I develop my own casino"  Why can't you do that? Because thats not what they're for. Stop asking for advice, literally rule #1.  We get it, you have RobinHood and that sick fat stimmy check and you're ready to blow it all on the next big "meme stock" also yes we know you think "stock only go up ape strong together" It's understood. Let me also state this:   There is other stocks besides GME.    Oh yes, I know I've blown your mind and some of you have gone into cardiac arrest as well as having a stroke just by reading that. Sure, I get it, a chance to get rich quick sounds pretty cool. But, when you bring the entire homeless population of the world to   one   soup kitchen, the soup kitchen is gonna run out of food and be forced to shut down.    Also for some of you idiots if you only read one thing read this.           I even added rockets to get your attention.    THIS IS NOT A MOVEMENT. It's not a conglomerate, it's not a hedge fund. It's not the dream team, it's not where you go to band together to beat Wall Street. Why?   Rule #3 NO MARKET MANIPULATION.   Not only are you trying to break the rules of the Sub-Reddit, you're also breaking rules of the real world. We call those laws. What happens when you try to pump up a stock and rally other people? You get investigated, you get WSB shut down and some of you get fined and you may get some people sent to jail. If you read a good   DD   and you agree, make your own decision. Do your own   DD   and invest in it if thats what you decide. No one here is your baby sitter or you portfolio manager. You want one of those? Go to your nearest bank, find the fat guy behind the desk with his Salvation Army polka dot tie that he thrifted from the 90's and tell him you want investment advice. He'll have you sign some paper work and slap you into the sickest stocks that will annually earn you 3% and you'll be a happy   when you pay some of those sick fees that they charge.  Of course you can come and lurk and chime in if you have something useful to say but if you're only spouting off to ask for investing advice or asking what a basic term means, this is not the sub-reddit for you. Now, if you'll excuse me I'm going to eat my burger and try to gain back some of the brain-cells i've lost as well as cure my visual-aids i've received from reading some of these jaw-droppingly idiotic comments and posts.
Just wondering, where do you get your money to invest?
So I was looking at the posts of people dumping shitloads of money into Robinhood, and while my wife's boyfriend gives me some allowance it's not as much as some of you guys so I was wondering where your money comes from to invest.  I made a quick poll I'd love if you can fill out below, I appreciate honesty because I am also curious as to how people on WSB get their money.  I will post the results later.
To all the hedge funds buying bots and shills -
OK, now that the ape gang has been distracted by the emojis, let's get to the real topic at hand.  It's no secret that this sub is full of people making fun of the GME bag holders.  I know what you're thinking, they're just so retarded that you can't help make fun of them.  But according to the highly intelligent analysis on reddit, hedge funds are actually paying people to post on reddit to try to get retail investors to sell their   shares.  So since people are shitting on bag holders anyways, let's make a recruitment thread where you can put your shitposting resume and get some of that sweet hedge fund / wall street money.  Get in quick, because the reddit experts have assured me that the sub is overrun with shills and bots, so this is your chance to get paid.  ## Shitposting resume  ###Skills  I specialize in shitting on confirmation bias and inability to consider sunk cost / opportunity cost.  ###Notable Accomplishments  Accused of being both a George Soros shill and a Russian bot.
We started the fire. I love you guys.
I respect everything this movement has become. Not only did the GameStop coalition make some of you brilliant people pay off their student loans, put down payments on houses, and make multiple charitable donations to great causes, but it caused the world to see the flaws in the 'system' and 'the free market'. I'm in my late twenties and I've seen the best this country can't be.  My dad is a salesman. Growing up as a kid in the 90s, he supported me and my three siblings our whole lives. Before the the 2000s, bonuses were spread throughout the company he worked for at the time. If the company did well, if the sales people did a good job for the company they work for, everyone was given a fair bonus in accordance with the profits brought in. This way of comradery (fairness) doesn't seem to exist anymore. We see it as a fantasy that both the CEO and subordinates, that earn the company the real profits, can both profit together.  Everyone involved in the day-to-day labor worked their tails off for the betterment of the company they put the hours in for. All for the wellbeing for them and their families. Both the higher ups and 'underlings' worked in sync with one another for the most part, that being the chairmen of the company and the salespeople/installers that are involved in selling/implementing the product and all prospered from the work being done.   I am affected by that dream. I am censored by the billionaires/trillionaires that exist today. This trickle down effect where someone can be a literal trillionaire and the people under them are making fractions of those fractions of a salary for them and their families makes me nauseous. I'm tired of witnessing the general public just accepting it for the sign of the times. To be honest, it goes way past accepting it when it comes to the big wigs literally shutting trading down for people like us. People that see the shift in where it should be to where it is now.   I am fully in support of $GME and I hope the stock goes stratospheric like we all hope it will. But if you cant afford it, stocks like $BB, $PLTR, or $AMC should not be given up on. I guess I would just like to say I care for you and your future gains deeply and lets never give up trying to get back the American Dream that was promised to us after those crazy student loans or incredible debt. Good luck and Good fortune to all of you. Lets rock the world.  $ADLR
The real GME play is next month's earnings
Listen up apes; I know lots of you lost a lot of money over the past couple of weeks because you jumped on the hype train too late and bought the peak. I didn't. I invested in GME in December and took my 3000% profits on the 29th when it became clear that the momentum was over and that Wall Street would play all sorts of dirty tricks to prevent a true parabolic squeeze. I may not be half the autist that u/deepfuckingvalue is, but since I actually made money off this stock maybe you should listen to me instead of the bagholding conspiracy theorists who have been reaching the top of this sub lately.  GME won't be going to $1000, or even return to $  anytime soon. That being said, GME is still an undervalued company with great growth potential. Lots of smart people have put out excellent DD on this company and I won't attempt to equal their work; if you want an overview and some valuation estimates just visit   or watch Roaring Kitty's old streams.  Here's the deal: short interest is still pretty high and mainstream investors largely remain convinced of the BS "next Blockbuster" narrative. This belief, plus the WSB bagholders who are gradually cashing out is pushing the stock below the $60-$100 range I believe to be approximate fair market value.   GME is unlikely to rocket again until this belief is challenged, and the best opportunity for that to happen is the Q4 earnings announcement in late March  .     This is not financial advice and you should make investment decisions according to your own research, investment goals, and personal risk tolerance. I currently have 63 GME short puts at the $60 strike expiring on 2/19, and after assignment I plan to hold through earnings and maybe buy a few calls beforehand.    TLDR for the illiterate:   ⏭️📅  📈
Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together
TLDR:   Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened  . I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)  I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:  One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs (  or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.  I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this  . “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period.   A fail may also result from “naked” short selling  .”  Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.  According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive   naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price   to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about   persistent failures to deliver in the market   for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and   intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws  … We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that   substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.   Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover,   they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price  . (Source:   In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent "irrational exuberance and bubbles. But   when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”   Mr Cox also “referred to "the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “  a tool to drive down a company's stock price  " and that the SEC is "concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to   loopholes in Regulation SHO  " (which reminds me of this piece I wrote    As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that   naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground  . (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted   I also read ‘  One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares   for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create "  phantom" or "counterfeit" shares  , sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and   artificially depressing the share price’  ”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a "push" into extinction from "a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling". (Source:   All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.  On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of   billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.  Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ( , hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.  Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $  billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another.   These "failures to deliver" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices  .” (Source:    Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “  There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible  . Some companies with falling stock prices say it is   and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source:  .  "It has been alleged in   tens or hundreds of lawsuit  s that the DTCC and its   Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting   that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and   have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading  . (Source:    As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is   in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting   on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.  From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But   some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough  … Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say.   This "phantom stock" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”   (source:    From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:    GME shorts engaged in   naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122%     GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs (  and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close   As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float   The counterfeit shares can/have been used in     Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the   naked shorting happening in GME   There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.  With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and   call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing  l.   They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.   Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez    Al Green    Maxine Waters    Nancy Pelosi Email:  .  And you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to:      Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject      , so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.      This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.    Edit 2: A   put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read  Edit 3: If you want to read more in depth about counterfeiting stock this is a good place to start
Why is cross trade important?
What Is a Cross Trade?  A cross trade is a practice where buy and sell orders for the same asset are offset without recording the trade on the exchange. It is an activity that is not permitted on most major exchanges.  Why is it important?  This is important for one particular stock that shan’t be named, because when you cross trade, it doesn’t affect the price of that particular stock.  Now what these traders are doing to beat the system is, they are buying stocks when the market is close, and sell those stocks when the market is open. Creating a massive negative pressure, when we plebs are looking at the price, but no effect when they are buying their stocks and we are asleep.  TLDR- Imagine a boat where you row forward every time you buy a stonk, and row backwards every time you sell. Now cross trade allows you to row in the water when you want the price to go down, and row in the air every time you are buying that stock you just sold to lower the price.
What is the future of WSB?
I miss what was left of the old WSB culture before 7 million new subscribers in a month obliterated it into some sort of virtual Occupy Wallstreet.   I'm not trying to be a whiny bitch about it, but I think it's worth discussing where we go moving forward, or whether old WSB is just dead and we're at the whims of the overwhelming majority of fresh meat.  I see people who don't get the concept of yolo and think this is some sort of investing forum or collective get rich quick scheme, and sadists who think it's a place to  "egg people on into doing a stupid bet then laughing at the results" .  Maybe I'm wrong, but to me none of that has ever been WSB.  I'm not trying to gatekeep the culture, I wasn't here at the start although I have been around on and off for more than 5 years, and I think of WSB as a place where we make or become market memes, and occasionally share an intelligent high risk bet, or the large gains/losses from one.   A place where there's more discussion than  "I like the stock"  - often using leverage or options in ways that will lose a novice money. A place where money is taken lightly and no one is gambling their house even if they are putting hundreds of thousands on the line.  I don't really care if people want to keep holding Gamestop in hopes of triggering a short squeeze to a million, if they can do it that's fine, but there's no finesse to pressing the buy button on a stock and honestly it's kind of boring compared to past plays. DFV's play was interesting and WSB worthy because he came up with a thesis, had conviction and posted the results, and along the way he didn't just buy stock he also flipped options to make like $13+ million in addition to the stock he was holding. Excellent content.  I'm curious to hear what other people who have been around here for more than 6 months think as well. Is there any way to keep the old culture, is it a lost cause with so much new blood, or maybe you even like the new evolution of WSB?  &nbsp;  TLDR: WSB got popular  womp womp . Anyone up for a paper trading competition?
GME: 'power' to the people who played themselves
Yes, I sold GME on the way up. You might be angry with me. You have no right to be. I never signed up to be part of your movement. I couldn't think of a stupider method of trying to hurt Wall Street fatcats if I tried. Handing them briefcases full of your own cash would probably be more effective, because some of them would get caught by the IRS for not paying taxes on it.   ##A Lesson that can be learned:  There's plenty of publicly available information that you should have read before YOLO-ing hard-earned money into a so-called 'movement'.  ##This wasn't a story of the little guy versus the big bad hedge fund  (   More than half of all GME stock is owned by institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, and State Street Corp. How are you going to stick it to the man when you're driving up the price of the stock that fucking Morgan Stanley owns? Please explain to me how this is a better idea for a social movement than donating money to a charity that helps poor people.   ##You're deluding yourself on the value of the company.  (     GME insiders have disclosed   ZERO share purchases   in 2021.    Ryan Cohen bought shares at   $15   in mid-December.    All reported insider transactions in 2021 have been sales of shares, ranging from   $19 - $36.      Kurt Wolf, a Director of GameStop   sold 810,000   shares of GME on January 12/13th at   $19 - $30.    Now please explain to me how you, a reddit user with a moderate amount of karma, can justify a price for GameStop that is higher than $36 per share. What do you know that the insiders who work for the company do not know? Please enlighten everyone about “cloud gaming” or whatever. Maybe call Kurt Wolf and explain it to him.  ##People were horrible to Andrew Left  He's a douche. I get it. People were too mean to him though. People made it way too personal. It's fucking scary seeing you guys turn into a mob. Remember when Reddit tried to find the Boston Bomber, they accused the wrong guy, and he [censored by automod]? That was super fucked up. I'm glad nothing like that happened with Andrew Left, but you guys probably scared the shit out of his friends and family.  ##Takeaway: Next time you see an angry, stupid mob trying to justify their greed as "a movement" tell them to fuck right off  You want to invest money in a way that makes the world a better place? Read this:    You want to donate money to charity? Read this:    But if you want to join a pump-n-dump while deluding yourself into believing that you're doing it for the greater good, then keep that shit to your fucking self because it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  ##In closing, a wager  If GME goes to $500 by the end of February, I will drink my own piss.  If GME does not break $500 by the end of February, you have to promise to read a book about investing, personal finance, or philanthropy.  Comment "bet" and I'll tag you in the piss video / 'what book are you reading' thread on March 1st. I nuke my post history a lot but I'm not nuking this one, feel free to screencap it.

To clarify why NOVAVAX isn’t done...
I will continue to hold...   This vaccine is more inline with traditional vaccines.   This vaccine can be produced with the equipment that labs already have to produce SARS and flu vaccines.   This vaccine is more accessible to poorer countries.   This vaccine is backed by Bill and Melinda Gates.   This vaccine will be first to combine the COVID-19 and FLU vaccines into one sesh.   MOST IMPORTANTLY, this vaccine, unlike RNA vaccines, doesn’t turn your cells into viral protein factories, who knows what long term side effects that has. (PGH1979)
Uber FD DD... 50/50
So, I was just burned on Lyft and Uber puts because I didn’t do any DD and went in with just a ‘guess’ and ‘anecdotal’ evidence that they would have bad earnings and a larger loss than usual. So, I present to you my grappling at straws reversal.    So Uber is the most well known ride sharing service with a market cap of $110 billion whilst still not being profitable despite many desperate  suggestions that they will turn a profit by the end of 2020.  Uber has had a hard year as their revenue dipped 50% due to the virus and their losses tripled. They were hemorrhaging cash like always but more. And then they took the unprecedented step of selling their AI research division off. This has huge implications as from my understanding was their business model was to get a huge market share of the industry and then when autonomous vehicles are around it will enable robotaxis making them humongous profit.   This may seem bad but it’s very bullish. They sold it to start-up Aurora Technologies and will invest $400million giving it a 26% stake. This would be 10% of their revenue pre-covid and a much larger %age in these cash-strapped times. Though Uber has a very strong balance sheet dropping pre-covid from 10B to 6B in their most recent earnings - Q3 2020. This shows they are actually pushing to achieve profitability and may give a nice speech for earnings showing their bullish gameplan.     UberEats was much less of a cash loss than Uber whilst still being a cash hole and during the pandemic this really shone through. Delivery rose 134% year on year. Also have you noticed their new ubereats fees such as the service fee? Bullish.    Ubers Q4 2020 earnings is after market close today and their EPS estimate is $  This is  huge expectation and I think it would be their most profitable earnings ever. Q1 2020 their EPS was   and Q4 2019 it was   - just pre-covid. … I’m not so bullish anymore but a FD is a FD.     Lyft shares had an EPS of $  beating estimates of   and they didn’t have the same opportunities such as fortifying their balance sheet by ‘selling’ their autonomous vehicle division or a profitable food delivery division.    Finally, I just want to make my money back and so this DD is just to justify myself and hope for the best. Pre-market prayer can start from now.     Positions: None yet. Haven't even checked the IV or if I can afford it. Need to sell these put bags first.
Just a reminder that Jan 29th was almost two weeks ago
The short interest for GME is 2 weeks outdated. That means in two weeks the short interest fell by 45 to 70% depending on how you measure it.   If it fell at a similar clip SI is likely in the 30-50% range.   Y’all are going to panic buy in the morning. $GME will likely be trading at $20 a share within 3 weeks time. Bookmark me.   I’ll be buying puts in the morning. That’s the real  🤚 move and I recommend you do the same.  1 - I’m not a bot.  2 - I don’t work for Melvin or any other hedge fund.  3 - Maybe cut the cultish behavior and listen to dissenting opinions? and   4 - this is not financial advice blah blah blah and I could be fckn wrong
Will the real Short Interest please stand up
This is a discussion post to learn and discuss about the latest GME SI data. As a retard GME bag holder I want to know what is the different between the data published by FINRA and the data published by pretty much every other venues. I will be posting compilations of sources here    shows GME SI at   of float.    also showing at      posted for GME at      data showing GME SI at      shows data at      data shows      reports      Reported "about 50%" lol  TDAmeritard is showing   of float. Will post SS tomorrow.     Update 1:  My fellow retards. I searched the internet far and wide and I still dont have an answer to this. There are many theories but nothing rock solid and conclusive. Maybe I am too retarded. To add to the fuckery I added AMC below    SI at      SI at       Update 2:   Thank you u/sidepart for figuring out the Math. Please check his  . The number of short is constant at   million shares shorted. The next mystery is why FINRA use   millions free float vs WSJ, bloomberg using   millions free float shares. Did institution just bought 23 million shares and this data is yet to be reflected by wsj and bloomberg ?
the squeeze has not yet sqouze. lets discuss!!!
The squeeze has not squoze! I repeat, the squeeze has not squeeze!         most likely that   number is low and we're still over 100% short interest.
Still might get me tbh
Now that the short report is out, has anyone figured out who the new most shorted stock on Wall Street is?
Who’s the new unlucky monarch?  And do you think it will become a new target for the retail horde?      I certainly wouldn’t want to be the firm short the new c , that’s for sure.  It adds a whole new element of risk.  It could be argued that the you-know-who bubble was only a one time thing, but also it isn’t  impossible  for it to happen again.     It’s a shame that the easy to read sites won’t be updated for a day or two, but I feel confident some clever autist or two has figured it out.
Until FINRA Monthly Short Sale Transaction Files Release, Let's Play with Daily Short Sales Volume Files!
At  the very least we can stare at the daily short sale volumes that come  out each day.  Below, in italics, I've pasted information directly from   , whenever it actually comes up.      "  Pursuant to a   Securities and Exchange Commission request, FINRA   makes short sale trade data publicly available for off-exchange (OTC)   trades in exchange-listed securities reported to FINRA’s Alternative   Display Facility (ADF) .  FINRA makes two types of files available: (1)   Daily Short Sale Volume Files; and (2) Monthly Short Sale Transaction   Files (collectively, the Short Sale Files). "          Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded "upstairs" but have to be reported.        "  The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated  volume by  security for all short sale trades executed and  reported to a TRF, the  ADF, or the ORF during normal  market hours for public dissemination  purposes ( , media-reported trades).  There are individual files for   the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq  Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF.   There is also a file entitled "Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale  Volume Files," which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed  securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF. "         Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.        "The  Short Sale Files are not consolidated with exchange data. To obtain a   complete picture of the short sale volume to total volume for a   particular exchange-listed stock, market participants must combine data   from the separate files for each of the TRFs and the ADF, as well as   from each exchange. "          Short sale trades done on NYSE for instance, are NOT in these files        "  The Short Sale Files do not—and are not intended to—equate to  bi-monthly  reported short interest position information. The short  interest data  reflects aggregate short positions held by market  participants at a  specific moment in time on two discrete days each  month, while the Daily  Short Sale Volume File reflects the aggregate  volume of trades executed  and reported as short sales on each trade  date. "          The GOOD STUFF is in the Monthly Short Sales files.        " The     Short Sale Files exclude any trading activity that is not publicly disseminated.     As a result,     some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily Fil    e and may  result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale volume  to total volume. "          These files DO NOT contain everything from "upstairs" if they didn't report it!!!       So let's plot all the information available for 2021, from each of the daily short sales files.     And below I've summed up across the specified days that the Monthly report usually covers.        Jan 1st-15th   Jan 16th-29th   Feb 1st-9th    :- :- :- :-     Short Volume   84,529,878 155,033,361 79,236,275     ShortExempt Volume   1,119,003 3437532 4,306,437     Total Volume   193,791,490 415,527,741 146,617,603        TLDR: These are objective numbers from FINRA, fuck the shills and bots, and remember every time you feed a troll 3 times they get $     Edit 1: 9:09pmEST finra-markets.morningstar reports     Short Interest      Edit2:    hold   206% of shares,   reported on same page with     SI      Edit TIMER:       still not out... 10:06pm
Viacom - VIAC and why it’s the future
ViacomCBS - VIAC and why it’s the future.  I’ve noticed that barely anybody is talking about this stock even though they had multiple commercials during the superb-owl.   ViacomCBS which owns - Nickelodeon, ⭐️BET, VH1, MTV, Comedy Central, C M T, and Paramount pictures  Is collabing with CBS which owns - Showtime, CBS access, and Sports ball (like NFL, NBA, College football c , and the PGA Worldtour).   To create their own streaming service. Disney + has already took all their content off of other streaming platforms and these services have the right to strip their content off Titans like Hulu and Netflix as well.   Nickelodeon - has started their slime cam on NFL games to add their own cartoon touch to it. (yeah it’s corny, but it’s a nice twist)   BET and C M T - have a select audience who would much rather pay for a streaming service then stay on cable tv to watch their programs.  VH1, MTV, Comedy Central - these channels are most of the older generations demographic and if they put old vintage content on there (MTV Cribs,  , Beavis and butt-head) I see a lot of people wanting to relive those shows.  Paramount pictures - produced the Wolf of Wallstreet. I don’t even have to say anymore.       CBS - is America’s most watched network for the 12th consecutive year. That means humans really like this TV guys.  I’m not saying this is a million dollar idea and im not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock and it’s potential is endless. Netflix is at $559 a share and I can easily see this one hitting $150 by the end of this year.   Current status - $65 3/19 and looking to buy many more.  Edit : Accidentally deleted my post 😑
Aphria Inc (APHA): my final post before merger 😮‍💨🥦
Hello, some of you might know me from  .  I suggest you guys read those first, because I won't repeat earlier points I've made in other posts. I'm here to give you guys a final Aphria headsup before merger. I won't post again before merger, because I think this is the final moment to buy into APHA before merger at a reasonable price. Next post will be about gains after merger.  # Introduction (another look back)  Well, well, well. I have to take you guys back to the beginning. After a long time lurking, the Aphria posts were my first DD posts on this subreddit. What a journey that has been. I have to remind you guys that before  . And here we are right at this very moment, the entire subreddit is currently talking about it.   I know my DD probably wasn't the most best/detailled you guys will ever read. But I'd still like to think that my initial post inspired some others to buy APHA or do their own DD. I'd like to imagine some dude YOLO'd his life savings into it when he read my post and that person is sitting in Hawaii right now sipping on some coconut milk, getting his cock sucked by a hooker named Stacy and enjoying his life. That feeling is exactly why I am writing this last DD post for you retards right now. Hopefully everyone reading this post will listen to me now and I can make some more of you autists rich.  # There's no denying it: Cannabis market heading back to 2018 levels  I told you guys before, once the good news rally begins then we were going to head for the moon because of the volatility of cannabis stocks. This is exactly what happened. Cannabis will undoubtedly be federally legalized in the USA now. There might be minor political obstructions, but there's no stopping the general movement. Once the American legalization movement is done, it will probably also influence European regulators. Cannabis stock should be a part of your portfolio at this point. If it isn't already, let me give you another couple of reasons why.    It's not about the joints, it's about the CBD oil.   Let's be honest: to most people cannabis will still be seen as an addicting drug you should avoid because of the years that regulators spent demonizing it. You know which product doesn't suffer from a bad image? CBD motherfucking oil, I would even say it has a very positive image. Most people probably think about it like this: joints = junkees in the park getting high, CBD oil = people suffering from cancer relieving their pain. Its healing effects might be scientifically doubted, that doesn't change the general consensus about the product.   You should even think past the direct 'healing' effects, CBD oil is becoming a popular supplement for regular people. People will be buying drinks, food, even fucking s  with CBD oil in it. The market for it is the most promising across all cannabis products, because it is the most likely to become popularised throughout North America and also be partially legalized in countries that still ban marihuana (EU mostly). Growth estimates currently are that the total CBD oil market should roughly quintuple by 2025.    Markets are fucking insane right now, cannabis mania   is inevitable.   I don't have to tell you guys about it. This is the ideal investing climate for the cannabis market to go bonkers again, except this time there is actually nothing holding it back. The naysayers have no valid arguments against cannabis anymore like they had in 2018. There is absolutely a bubble blowing up right at this moment, so I quote old pal George Soros: "The first thing I do when I notice a bubble is invest more". The bubble isn't popping anytime soon people. Green energy, EV, cannabis: all these markets have very positive futures ahead of them. Cannabis might even be a long term hold this time around, can you guys believe it? The stock that has been memed so hard and struggled their way through the last couple of years is finally a worthy boomer investment. Praise the lord, Amen.  # Aphria/Tilray merger arbitrage: TLRYtards are missing out    There is no reason to pick Tilray over Aphria. There, I said it.   I talked all about the possible arbitrage in my previous post, but here is a small summary. Aphria and old Tilray are merging to new Tilray. Aphria will get a 62% stake in new Tilray, old Tilray will get a 38% stake. To account for this split, Aphria owners will receive   shares for each APHA share they own. Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings. There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than   The only risks are (1) the merger doesn't go through or (2) the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment, both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced.   Back then APHA to TLRY ratio was   and it has even worsened to roughly   at this moment. I've seen other people post about this, but they are missing something. As we move closer and the specific merger date is announced, the APHA to TLRY ratio will undoubtedly move to   so TLRY must fall or APHA must skyrocket by that date. The thing others are missing in their DD's is from the point you buy APHA, the matter if the APHA to TLRY split corrects itself doesn't matter to you personally anymore. All you have to do is compare YOUR buy-in price with the Tilray price. As long as that ratio is below the merger ratio of  , you will profit from the merger. It's as simple as that.    TLDR:   Cannabis = arguably best growth market for the near future or long term. Aphria = best candidate in the market because of APHA/TLRY merger. APHA to TLRY price ratio doesn't match with merger agreement = free tendies, no reason to pick Tilray. This is IMO the last time to buy in for a reasonable price.    Positions:   I still have my measily 30 shares @ $  that I've been holding since the start of December. If GME squeezes before the merger and I finally decide to cash in, I will probably buy more.
Many of you have been easily manipulated, take a good look at what's happening around you
There are lots of posts calling out all of the naysayers and ninnies that are obviously plants sent here to stir up chaos. Clearly it's working in all kinds of forms - there are certainly people folding and falling prey, but to what extent, who knows. There are posts that are manipulative on all kinds of levels, from careful timing of GME gain porn in the millions, to straight trash talk to GME holders, even posts on other subreddits trash talking GME holders. Anyone that's been here a while knows this kind of trash talk especially isn't normal or okay, it's not what we're about. We LOVE when people fuck up and lose a bunch of money, it's a fucking celebration, not a witch hunt. So what is a lone ape in a scary crowded jungle to do? Think about your situation. A large hedge fund vs. Reddit army story was shot out into the public. Mysteriously, buying ability was cut before the projected timing of the squeeze on social media. Shortly after, there were many warning posts of the remaining dirty tactics that we would face in the coming weeks, the serious manipulation, and the fact that it would realistically work on a lot of people. Mark Cuban stopped by, gave us some sweet tips, and warned us that very likely they think they're smarter than us & kept shorting. We are now in those coming weeks, and we are being mercilessly invaded with BS. This clearly indicates that there is an active effort to manipulate our users, which is a sign to me that we are on the path to doing some damage, and who else would target this community in this way? They have picked their side of this tug of war. Now, what side have others picked? Ask yourself this - if you were ANOTHER hedge fund right now, or any wealthy individual who dabbles in investing, would you jump on the short train and try to bankrupt Gamestop, kick back and watch, or buy GME? You are all out here looking like fools if you think the rich people that AREN'T shorting GME aren't trying to jump on this fucking money rocket. These people are rich for a reason, they are playing fucking 4D chess on y'all stupid fucks while you pick your nose and can't remember why you bought the stock you literally bought two fucking weeks ago. You have doubts now because your 30 year old neighbor who invests in bonds made a comment about how loaded you'd be if you sold at $400. Stay strong in your resolve, take note of the clues around you, and remember what convinced you this was a good decision in the first place. Unless you're a mouth breathing humanoid who just wanted to 10x their pathetic life savings instantly and bought in without reading more than three sentences, in which case, you're probably in the right place so just shut the fuck up for a while until this blows over.   This is not financial advice I kinda just like the stock.         tl;dr - there are a lot of other people/hedge funds that invest money that aren't active on WSB or currently shorting GME, and they've probably put some thought into how they can most profit off of this situation based on actual analysis. I'm not one of those smart guys but it seems like usually the answer where more rich people get richer is how it goes.  EDIT: I've been looking at users tonight and noticed there are seemingly bots that got in early enough to pretend to be in on the hold, all just to make it even more convincing when they decide to sell. There are also bots offering to pay redditors to post about selling GME, and maybe redditors are taking the bribe even if they aren't selling in true WSB degenerate fashion. Anyways, I think I'm going to get off this sub and hold until this all blows over...
Gamestop Institutional Broker Trades off the Exchange ("Upstairs")
repost from /r/stocks Gamestop is the top cross traded security according to Bloomberg Terminal. Indication of interest trades are executed off the exchange and don't appear even on Level II data, and are executed in block trades to lessen the impact on the security's price. Below is unbiased, statistical data exported to Excel.                 probably why we saw trades for $200+ a share yesterday.
Can we get an "Actual DD" sticky thread?
I've been lightly participating in the sub for 6 years.  Obviously, the quality has recently taken a shit.    Don't get me wrong, I love memes, shitposts, and calling myself a retard as much as all of you love pleasuring my husband's mom, but I have a suggestion:  A weekly or daily sticky thread named "actual DD" and I mean, obviously it's not gonna be REAL DD, we are in fucking wall street BETS.  But still, maybe all parent comments in that post could at least try to pretend to do DD instead of just "diamond hands yolo hurrr durrr."  I dono, just an idea.  Fuckin downvote me if you don't like it.  edit: oh cool, they  .
For shills and new blood.
1st rule of wallstreetbets is that wallstreetbets is not an investment subreddit.     2nd rule of wallstreetbets is that wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit     I've been subbed and unsubbed from this subreddit about a thousand times. I've lurked for years. I've posted. I've commented. The number of times that I've seen the term bagholder in the past 6 years I could count on one hand. The number of times I've seen the term bagholder in the past week would rival my loss porn in zimbabwean dollars.     Wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit. Bagholding is what happens when you make a good investment, get greedy and miss the window of opportunity to cash in your investment. I can't be a bagholder because I wasn't ever investing.     I'm a gambler. This subreddit is for high risk high reward gambles particularly ones that occur with stocks, options, and trades. If I buy a stock and hold on to it as it falls to the ground, then plunges through the ground, then winds up in Satan's basement it's not because I was bag holding. It's because I made an epic gamble and the gamble lost.     This subreddit for the longest time has never had gains as it's highest priority. The honor has always been reserved for the highest %change. It's always been about taking risks. And it loves to see a high %loss just as much as a high %gain.     DFV isn't a hero because he put 13 million dollars into his pocket. He's a fucking hero because he dumped 50,000 into a deep OTM call. For months he lost money. Crazy amounts of money in fact. And you know what, he held. And this subreddit loved to see his losses. He's a hero because he held onto the ball long after most people would have sold.     But if the 4 million new people on this sub had logged in May of 2020, they'd all be talking about DFV as a "bagholder".     If you use the term bagholder, you don't understand this sub. Go elsewhere. Go to r/investing. Buy an index fund. Collect some dividends and set them up for reinvestment. But don't come here and pretend that you know shit about shit. You don't even know the fucking language, let alone the culture.
TLRY, APHA recap and future speculation
I posted a few months ago back when tilray and aphria were in the 10-15$ range about the future outlook for what we could see later this year and I made the prediction that it would pass 50$ (currently 48) later in the year... boy was my timeframe wrong, several sweetheart government deals from major countries has catapulted tilray up massively and this has been overlooked since we have had the gamestop run. I am asking the community if there is any new information that might be out there and to compile it so we can make the next move informed.  I also heard tilray is shorted 50% but dont know how true this is.   I locked in 1400$ on a 100$ call and I am looking for my next bet; if i dont just purchase shares.  New outlook is 70$ range by next January, but who knows maybe it surges to 100+ if they legalize weed.
Can we get off S3's nuts?
This sub trusted S3's data on short interest up until January 31st, where they revealed news that they didn't want to hear. Then some bullshit started flying around that S3 ChAnGeD tHe WaY tHeY rEpOrT sI that so many retards on this sub kept bringing up. I encourage you to go look at both S3 Partners and Ihor's twitter and see for yourself that they have always been consistent in the format that they report their data.  But I know you are retarded, so you won't, so I will share them for you.  Report on high SI. Notice the date on the X axis (covers up to maybe up to Thursday, the 28th)    "BREAKING NEW DATA"     Ihor's explanation    The above tweets caused a shit storm around S3. People claiming that they were fudging numbers, got a call from Citadel, and that they changed the way they report SI to be sneaky. Here's some additional tweets by both S3 and Ihor (who works at S3) that objectively show that they have always been consistent with how they report short interest.   Jan 29th S3 reporting float with both SI and S3 SI    Jan 27th Ihor reporting float with both SI and S3 SI    Jan 5th Ihor reporting float with both SI and S3I    They have always reported SI % AND SI S3 %. They have always stated that the former is the traditional and the latter is their method which prevents the percentage from being over 100%. These above tweets are just limited to GME. You can browse their tweets over a variety of other stocks and see the same method of reporting. This data is consistent with other sources, it's not like S3 is out there peddling numbers that no one else agrees with. Every time I see someone claim S3 ChAnGeD tHe WaY tHeY rEpOrT sI I know without a doubt you are a Kool-Aid drinking retard.
🤲 $APHA since 2017
Let's talk about being a closeted    , Fed going Brr, and thoughts about the state of the market.
Tl:dr My belief is that even though there should be a correction, and the market is super inefficient and broken, it's probably not gonna shit the bed 'til the Fed stops going Brrrr.  To consider as a bear thesis.     1. Every 5-7 years there is a significant correction. Save a quickly recovered Covid crash we're on year 12. 87-91, 91-98, 98-2003, 2003-2008, 2008-Now? 2. Last time PE ratios were this high (2008) they crashed back down. Previous was the dot com bust. 3. Today's Volume was stupidly low, which is concerning. 4. It wouldn't be a stretch to say we're in a mania phase of a bubble.  Look at all the new 'dumb' money pouring in. 5. The economy doesn't "feel" healthy, the divide between rich and poor is getting worse, real unemployment is high, no definitive end in sight for the covid-pocolypse.     Then all the contrary stuff.  1. We're on QE (some fucking high number). The Fed is going Brrr, has been going brrr, and doesn't look like they are gonna stop going brrrr. 2. Along with going Brrr they are keep rates super low, which means there isn't a place to put money other than stonks. 3. Yellen has been fed chair during booms, and doesn't wanna fuck up her rep. She's more concerned with unemployment than inflations, which means she's gonna keep going brrr, and she's Keynseyan AF. 4. Biden et al probably don't want to be seen as responsible for a market crash, and I don't know how much longer they have to let it crash where they can say it's from Trumps policies. 5. Maybe the March covid-crash was enough for the steam to be let off, even though it was temporary AF.     Grantham is generally bearish, and he's saying he expects early summer correction.    Gundlach says valuations are extremely high, because of the Fed.  Also that emerging markets are finally outpacing US equities.    I'm looking for something concise from Mohammed El-Erian  Michael Burry seems bearish, but last I saw was still long a lot of domestic equities.  Anyone else?     So I guess I'm thinking inflation is gonna be a bitch, the fed will keep going brrr, and the market will get increasingly uncomfortable because it seems like it's on borrowed time, but will continue going up until it doesnt.  Any Bears or Bulls wanna tell me I'm full of shit, please do.
NO DEAL MELVIN! THAT MOON MONEY IS MINE!
GME and AMC are dead, and here's why.
Just kidding. They're not. But what in the actual fuck is going on with the mods and this sub right now? Any posts are getting taken down under rule 2.  Yet u/blowtestmebaby can spam the shit out of the sub every few minutes with BS posts that are downvoted into oblivion? Something seriously fucked up right now. We have an 8+ million community right now and there's nothing getting through the mods/auto-mods except for a sparing few posts.  What in the actual fuck. Whether you think GME or AMC are garbage or not, this is NOT WSB.  Edit: also funny how this is the first post in the last few hours that I've attempted to post (of many) that didn't get filtered out by the auto mod. And see title. 🤔   Edit 2: looks like u/blowtestmebaby either got banned or posts removed (finally). Not sure how it got through automod in the first place. But either way, quality posts are being rejected and it's fucked up. Just a heads up for people to be skeptical what you're seeing out of this sub. Do your own DD and don't be influenced by "bots". Buy/sell/hold whatever YOU want, when YOU want.  [](

GME and AMC short interest data
Finra, Fintel, and Wall Street Journal are reporting different percentages.     \--   Short Interest  :             -- Short interest % of Float:           -- Short interest % of Float:        \--   Short interest     % of Float:         \--   Short interest     % of Float:             Edit 1:   As a post mentioned earlier today, Citadel has lied before about their short interest data. There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.    Edit 2:   Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.    Edit 3:   I usually use Fintel, not Finra, but I don’t think some of the people commenting are right in assuming the Short Interest on Finra is the % of the float. Short interest ≠ Short Interest % of Float. They are different. Some other posts that recently updated are just throwing a % sign on there and saying it's % of float    Edit 4:   Hedge funds, if you're reading this right now, go fuck yourself.    Edit 5:   I’ve got about 750 shares of GME and a little over 8,000 AMC. I’m holding both. The discrepancies in the data across all these sites is all you need to know. To the moon  🌒
Disney ($DIS) Earnings (iChing, Horoscope, Tarot)
$DIS    Current price (6:32 pm, February 9, 2021): $   IPO price (09:30 am, November 12, 1957): $  ($  in 2021 dollars)  For my first query regarding Disney's stock price, I consulted the iChing - an ancient Chinese divination method that involves flipping 3 coins 6 times in order to form a hexagon based on their results (  heads or tails).  The upper trigram of this query was Gen, while the lower trigram was Kun, giving us the result of 23. According to  "  Key takeaways:   I don't believe we need to take "Splitting apart" literally, as in indicating a stock split. The bottom line of the iChing reading indicates the need for patience and bravery, which to me is a bearish signal. We may have to wait longer for parks to open, or earnings may not be as good as expected.  If we are to believe positively in the executive leadership of the Disney Corporation, then the second line indicates a willingness to change. I take this as a signal that they are pivoting to focus on direct to consumer revenue streams such as Disney+.  The third line clearly indicates the announcement of a partnership - or perhaps the ending of one. We will see on Friday.  The fourth line references to the misfortunes Disney has faced in the pandemic, but gives us hope that these times are coming to an end.  The fifth could indicate many different things. I feel that it could either be a positive signal relating to the pandemic coming to a swifter than expected end (positive vaccine news?) or it could indicate a growing dissatisfaction with political and other forces   Disney's business model.  The sixth line is absolutely bullish. I expect very positive forward guidance based on the iChing reading.    Horoscope for Friday, February 11, 2021      DISNEY SUN: SCORPIO      DISNEY MOON: CANCER    Data source :    Key takeaways:  "Today's New Moon occurs when Venus aligns with Jupiter in your solar fourth house, dear Scorpio. It's a beautiful time for feeling warmth or a   feeling of abundance  ."  "It's a time for emphasizing cooperation, trust, and faith."  "It can also be an excellent time to clear space around the home. Whether you're going bigger or creating the illusion of more space, it feels good. "  "There can be nice progress on a long-term project."  "You might enjoy fond memories or activities that focus on comfort and familiarity."  "You're inclined to make meaningful changes that enhance your current \[...\] arrangements."  "Avoid acting on impulse, and instead, focus on learning about your true needs."  To the WSBer reading this, it may seem bullish. But if you happen to be a member of Disney's board, I advise you to look at that last line and make sure that the decisions you are making as a company are good for the company as a whole. Avoid short-sightedness and rushing into things.  Predictions based on the horoscope: Bullish. Partnership. Scaling down parts of the business that are no longer profitable. New project announcement. Something tantalizing about the parks and cruises reopening.

Random Number \[1,300\]   (courtesy of      292    According to  , this number symbolizes getting insight and understanding in order to solve pressing problems. Note that is also in the 97th percentile of possible numbers. I interpret this as bullish on Disney's stock price and forward guidance.    Conclusion    Disney is going to blow out earnings and the stock price is going to skyrocket.  Positions: I have no position in $DIS   Disclaimer: I am a chartered financial astrologer.

$GME still has the potential to ruin this, DD inside
Fuck you.     The REEEEE is taming in the GME gang, the posts from the OGers are rising, the newbtards are on their way to the next retarded thing to lose more money on( they should just stay here, we pride ourselves on these losses) probaly some stupid dog dollars or 16 green shittercoins.  Things are returning to normal, which is why I would like to remind people of what's potentially on the menu, SPY is 30 points from getting to 420. With healthy pullbacks and rises in this market this is VERY achievable in the next 2 and half months.     So fuck your bag holding $GME shit, throw some leverage out there and yolo some spy 420 late April early may, post losses, i will.     make it happen   $SPY on 4/20( 4/19 is Friday so it must close at that.) Hedge funds will no doubt support this because stonks will be going up. so dont fuck this up and hold those dumb bags.  be a part of REAL history  none of this is financial advice I am however a certified retard( only took 5 years of being alive to get cert     oh shit my bad- .02 GME shares @ 500 still   think                 Edit: I am a long time wsber whose looking to get things back to normal. It seems the GME gang is just really really lost.....
Robinhood Cancelling Brokerage Transfers!?
On 2/4 I initiated a brokerage transfer from my Robinhood account to a new Fidelity account. Today I received an email from Robinhood saying my account was "unlocked." I had not interacted with my Robinhood account at all since a few days before I initiated the transfer (to make sure everything would settle after downgrading to a "cash" account). After 2 hours on hold with Fidelity today, they told me Robinhood had rejected the transfer. The reason they gave was that I had margin on my account. The problem is, I had already followed a redditor's advice and had downgraded my account to a cash account days before. I had made sure everything had settled before I initiated the transfer.   Now, in Robinhood's app, I no longer can find the option to disable instant deposit/margin. It seems they've hidden/buried it further. This is absolutely unacceptable.   Has this happened to anyone else? This is going to end up locking my account for an additional 2 weeks at least due to their shenanigans. I'm still holding some GME, as well as other assets I don't want to sell due to a taxable event. Does anyone have any advice?
All you people hard coping with GME right now. Stop making shit up and instead help the company.
Ortex isnt wrong S3 isnt wrong Finra isn't wrong. The squeeze was squoze. stop coming in here with the Q anon GME anon bullshit. Fuck out of here with that garbage. No you arent smarter than Ortex and S3 and understand the market better you fucking 3 week investing mongoloid.  Instead of making shit up to cope why don't you hop on the actual GME DD that occurred here before you tiny brain apes tried to take over.  Ryan Cohen is at the helm of this dying company. YES its a dying company that's why its a high risk high reward play. Could cohen fail? Yes he could and the company could go bankrupt. Do I think it will happen? Not at all especially with this free marketing.  People were doing amazing DD before your screaming drowned them out. Calling gamestop and finding out some stores are shifting into Gamestops   focused on building pc's and build a pc kiosks.  If you want to make your money back keep it in GME and talk about the upsides and bring actual conversation to the table. Make your voices heard to gamestop management you want them to involve pc building. I think bundling game pass and a built pc at gamestop is a great way to take share away from steam give it to Microsoft and build some capital for gamestop to utilize.  Give feedback on the app, what is easy and hard to use. Join the powerup Pro rewards program. BUY STUFF FROM GAMESTOP.   Gamestop has a chance to actually be a 20-40B company if they get a stranglehold on pc parts. they have the ability to beat CyberpowerPC and IbuyPower because they can afford lower margins for prebuilt pc's with their already set up distribution centers. They can open stores in all the areas microcenter doesn't exist. Microcenter does   in revenue with only 25 stores countrywide. that's insane!  Desktop PC market is 8 Billion yearly revenue. Bro that's a lot of market share they can chip away at.   Seriously stop looking at SI and making up shit to cope and actually help the company turn around to save your investment. GME can be $500 naturally in 5 years with a hardcore turnaround and some of that cohen customer satisfaction up his sleeves. Gamers are sluts for being treated well and cohen specializes in that.

The following data is   not   the short interest report. This shows, as the title implies, the daily short sale volume from 1 February 2021 through to 8 February 2021.

My fear and lack of self trust attributed to me missing out on the TSLA, CRSP, UAV, and GME booms. Don't be like me; find your passion, do your due diligence, and ride it to the moon.  📈 📈 ⭐
Back in March I had 10k(ish) that I was considering throwing down multiple avenues, yet my fear of losing it all drove me to be complacent with what I had and just keep saving. Now, I've got 20 grand in hand; nothing more nothing less, just 20. I have a special ed forces talent (the same one that I see inside of some of you) that could have net me 100's of racks within the year had I believed in myself, yet I blew it by "playing it safe". Don't be like me lads. If you have a dream, chase it! Either you'll go to the stars and be happy that you tried or you'll end up back on earth and lose a bit of money that could be made back in a year. Don't let your dreams be dreams, turn your dreams into memes so that you can laugh about how successful you've become.   this is not financial advice, as I am not a financial advisor. Just a skinny 🦧 who wishes he had more 🍗 to eat.   Edit: While this ALSO isn't financial advice, it is my opinion and I'd like to make it clear. Please don't trade with anything that you absolutely can't afford to lose, if you have to choose between taking care of necessities/eating and investing then you genuinely shouldn't be investing until you're in a better position financially. Cut back on some frivolous expenditures for a few paychecks/months to build a "start up fund" if you REALLY want to get started guilt free, don't go throwing your rent into a $rope in the hopes of being able to get next months rent free.
I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES' WILD RIDE!
About that Finra report.
Edit: And for everyone wondering, I was in no way implying that ortex, s3, etc. are misreading the fucking data.  My bad for inputting the morningstar link, I was editing the post before posting and changing how I was expressing things and didn't remove it.  It has been removed.    I was flat out stating that people HERE are going to look at the finra data and read it wrong, seeing potentially higher concentration of short to volume and also not realizing it's a snapshot at a specific time and long sales the same day could mean that there's more short sales reported than there were short positions created, when all is said and done.          Taken directly from     Found by going to the short interest reporting page here       and going to notices and clicking on the top one, which is the newest one      I believe everyone here, from what I've seen, is just looking at the number on the report and say OMG LOOK AT THAT SHORT INTEREST!       The notice from Finra, however, says that is not an accurate way to read the data.  Bolding of key points below is mine.      FINRA believes that the following three key points about the short sale volume data may help market participants better understand and draw informed conclusions about the data. As discussed below, the data:   (1) does not include any trades that are not publicly disseminated, (2) is not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does not—and is not intended to—equate to short interest position information.           Keys to Understanding Short Sale Volume Data   First, as noted above, the data in the Short Sale Files includes only trades that are publicly disseminated and excludes trades that are not publicly disseminated.   As a result, some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily File and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale to total volume.        A common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this trading model involves two separate trades—one between the two firms and one between the firm and its customer—the two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported   If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with the firm’s purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the firm’s short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale.      Second, as noted above, the data is published separately by FINRA for each FINRA trade reporting facility and by each exchange, and is not consolidated.   Thus, to obtain a complete picture of short sale volume to total volume in a particular listed stock, market participants must combine data published by FINRA for each of its trade reporting facilities, as well as data published by the exchanges.  6      For example, suppose that for security ABCD, FINRA published a combined short sale volume of 3,000 shares and total volume of 15,000 shares for all of its trade reporting   Viewing only this off-exchange data published by FINRA, the percentage of short sale volume to total volume would appear to be 20%. Suppose, however, that there was also activity for ABCD executed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that day totaling 125,000 shares, of which 12,000 shares were reported as short. This volume is published by NYSE on its website, separate from the volume published by FINRA. When considered together, the overall percentage of short sale volume to total volume for ABCD that day is  , which is much lower than the data published on the FINRA website would suggest.      FINRA notes that the SEC has a webpage where market participants can find links to the short sale volume data published by FINRA and the exchanges,8 which may facilitate consolidation of the data and provide market participants a more complete picture. However, some exchanges charge a fee for access to their         Finally,   short sale volume data does not—and is not intended to—equate to reported bi-monthly short interest information.   FINRA rules require firms to report, on a per security basis, the total quantity of shares held as short positions in all customer and proprietary firm accounts twice a month. FINRA publishes the short interest data for OTC equity securities on its website, while the data for listed stocks is published by the exchange on which the stock is listed.   Although some websites redistribute the Daily File and refer to the data as “short interest,” it is not, in fact, the equivalent of reported short interest information.          Some market participants mistakenly conclude that the bi-monthly short interest data is understated because the Daily File reflects short sale volume that is much larger than what is reported as short interest. However, short interest data reflects short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily File reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed as short sales on each trade date. Therefore, while the two data sets are related ( , short sale volume may ultimately result in a reportable short interest position), they are not necessarily correlated.        For example, if a firm sells short 1,000 shares of security ABCD, then purchases 1,000 shares of ABCD later the same day, the short sale volume in the Daily File will include the 1,000 shares that were sold short. Because the firm sold short and purchased an equivalent number of shares that day, it did not establish or accumulate a short position in ABCD; thus, its short sale has no impact on the reported short interest in ABCD.
Do I qualify as a real retard yet?
So I'm basically new to the sub.   I was one of the insurgents who flopped into WSB after catching wiffs of sweet nothings, flung my dolla billz into the swirling vortex, and have been lurking/casually participating in this sub over the past few weeks now.  One thing I see is an endless amount of people talking about their losses on 10 shares of AMC or 2 shares of GME.   I'm down a little over 7k on AMC and GME alone right now AND I KNOW THIS IS ROOKIE SHIT.    In the spirit of the WSB I've only been able to get wiffs of a long-passed fart from, here is my contribution of soft-core loss porn.  Gotta respect the home you barged in to.       edit  : Retard confirmation. Can't read good. " losses of more than $2,500 or $10,000 USD for options or stocks respectively ." Apparently I don't understand the word respectively. Guess I need to throw some more into the inferno to make this valid.

GME squeeze has been squoze? I believe so... for now.
I am of the opinion that many of the HFs have covered their short positions. This was more or less confirmed by the NYSE short interest report published today.  As seen    I pulled out of GME to stop the bleeding (I know, paper hands). I entered at 321.  Since I have made some money back on GME puts. The short interest report published today is a bearish indicator if you were planning on holding out for short squeeze. I'm sorry to say that a short squeeze is less likely than before. It's unlikely that we will reach the same highs as before unless shorts double down again. We will have to keep an eye on the short interest for the foreseeable future.  For now, bearish sentiment around GME is indicated by the  .  Today I placed an order after hours for a GME $50 put expiring on 2/19. Not financial advice.  EDIT:   for those asking

Where the next year takes us..
Hope everyone is doing well this fine day. Here are some good and interesting stocks to add to your research list. Not everything has to be A GME AMC bagholder debacle. Where are they now?  Anyways, There are many good plays to watch out for: OPEN,  offers to property sellers through an online process, improves and repairs the properties it purchases, and relists them for sale. Markets are changing folks. People want instant demand. OPEN had a nice runup today but within the next 6 months will be wayyyy better. This is a strong hoousing market play that will shake up the industry. Like uber to taxis. Q4 earning on 4-March-2021. Don't sleep on these guys. Holding long with stocks on this one.     PLTR. Ive been mentioning this one time and time again. I firmly believe in this company. They have a strong leadership team. They are pulling in big contracts and their financials are looking promising. They havent mooned just yet and I am personally invested in this company. However, I am only mentioning this stock for the potential it has. It is a massive analytic software company that can do amazing things. Their software program combines massive data queries into a seamless almost gamelike visual representation easy for the user to comprehend. Yes they had a nice runup recently do to an IBM partnership. I am holding long with stock since it was $18 and i have LEAPS for Jan 2022.     A more risky stock with the potential for a large runup is CLOV. If you dont know who Chamath is, he is a legend now and someone i highly respect in the financial world given his background, knowledge, and calling out those hedge funds during the GME debacle. CLOV is a healthcare provider play. Now why is this a risky play? Well with Biden as president of the USA, he plans to decrease medicare eligible age from 65 to 60, I know thats huge. Currently, each week, there are 10,000 new people eligible for medicare. those are some massive numbers, numbering billions added in revenue for the industry. Chamath is on of the major reason behind this stock. He is a person focused on growth. He assisted Facebook back in the early 2000s and look where they are now. His backing of CLOV will put them in the spotlight especially if there are positive changes to medicare (especially since offfering medicare plans is their specialty). Chamath walks the walk and talks the talk. But as always do your own research. I personally invested stock in this company. and i look forward to see where this goes.     Look at the big picture everyone! Stay positive and ask lots of questions.     So now what should you do with this information??  TLDR: OPEN, PLTR, CLOV good stocks. DO YOUR OWN DD     EDIT: Thank you everyone for getting me to   Karma. Glad i can help this community. And thank you all for the awards. We all deserve something positive in our lives :)
Definitive PROOF of GME short ladder attack
All you retard need shut up and listen to me, I spoke to a friend in finance who has definitive proof of GME short ladder attack. Take a look and tell me this is not true!     Hold The line!             I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL!      A reminder that this is my opinion and not financial advice. I'm not recommending anything. Look at the data yourself and come to your own opinion.     Edit: Lol! Can't believe people are so offended by this. I got added to r/ControversialClub for this shitpost.    Ladder Gang for lyf!! ✌️✌️
Rolls Royce
Today   showed up in my app's list of 'popular' stocks. This means lots of volume.   RR's graph shows a year long decline into the dirt. With the start of the pandemic being quite defined in that decline. But the year leading up to the pandemic wasn't great either.           Rolls Royce isn't doing so well. They're losing billions. Their stock is in the dirt, and it looks like people have started picking it up, for dirt cheap.  Some day, the pandemic will fizzle out and air travel will pick up. That will cause the demand for jet engines to pick up, and if RR is still alive by then, their stock should start a recovery.   If one was to invest in Rolls Royce, this might be the time to yolo in and   hope they don't go bankrupt  . And then wait out the pandemic and hope for their recovery. So basicly, it's a really stupid investment. Unless if it works out, then it's not stupid. If RR survives, they might come out the other end with their fat trimmed, "lean and mean".  Obviously not financial advice. This is merely an observation. If anything, it might just be interesting to watch how low their stock can go.

TAKE THE SUB BACK, DOWNVOTE GME INTO THE GROUND. THIS IS NOT R/WSBGME
Please for the love of God. I promise you there's more people here sick of their bullshit then there are anyone enjoying it at this point.   If everyone would just use the DOWN vote button instead of rolling their eyes and scrolling past another repetitive meme, we could clean this place up in no time.   Theres a dude throwing 6 figure YOLOs at AMD and morons are busy talking about "iTs gOnNa sQuEeZe" like they can't pull up a chart and see   the squeeze was squoze   no matter how much fluffy confirmation bias you idiots post a million times a day.   If they need their confirmation bias so badly, they can search "GME." I'm sick of it filling up the front page just because there's a band of idiots hoping they didn't make a massive mistake. I get the bags are heavy and you need help, but suffer silently  please.

$CBAT $SUNW $SPI $OXBR Y'all are missing the point.
$CBAT is going to be a great play further yet:  Their new tabless batteries hold further implications than just for EV companies like tsla, the Chinese government have been looking for alternative sources of energy storage, and will refuse to use foreign businesses for the case of infrastructure development.  CBAT's already existing patents have their primary implications in the EV/ES sector, but the tabless battery announcement mainly points to  grid-integrated energy storage as an immediately profitable direction for the company.  Position:    Long $CBAT for 276000 shares at .77 cost basis, up 418k.
I like the stonk

$THO. Over or under valued?
Like many people I bought a travel trailer last fall just so I could go do SOMETHING!  I got mine used so the rest doesn't pertain to me..  Many of my friends also decided to buy   can't find them!  There is literally a waiting list for these things at dealers.  Those that did get one can't find a park that has seasonal rentals, and most weekly sites are already   are sold   February.  This is very unusual.  If you don't believe it check for yourself.  Check your local rv dealer and popular    sites.  This makes me think that even though $THO has had a phenomenal year, it's not over.  Thor is the big guy in this industry.  If they can't keep up who can?   I think short term it's a no brainier.  This could also play into autos since you can't haul a 10,000lb trailer with your wife's boyfriends  93 Yougo.    That said, $THO has had a huge run since March, and has been hovering in the 120s.  I'm wondering  if it's at its peak or could  go higher once we thaw out and it stops raining.     Thoughts?
Why $FSR Will MOON This Week
Fundamentals:  \- Balance Sheet, strong AF sitting on $1B in cash  ESG:  \- Will compete with multiple established EV carmakers like Tesla and Lucid, but also pair well with companies and consumers who want to have an affordable EV SUV like the Fisker Ocean  Recent Hype/Momentum:  \- Morgan Stanley increased their PT to $27  Link to article:    \- Investors await for potential Biden EV tax credit which will boost all EV companies, especially those smaller companies who are under the 200K cars production where consumers can take advantage of the tax incentives  PROVEN TRACK RECORD  \- Fisker has previously made the Fisker Karma which was one of the first ultra luxury electric vehicles on the market.     TLDR; $FSR will continue its run up from prior momentum from Morgan Stanley near the end of last week as it enters price discovery in a high demand product type     Positions: 2/19 30c, 2/19 20c
Now I am a proud retarded.
Tired of you noob gays calling everything a "P&D"
Reddit went from   subs to 9M subs in like two weeks because of gamestop. Even if 98% of these 9M subs weren't broke AF with $50 in their Robinhood accounts, and each person invested $1000, that would only be 9 billion dollars of purchasing power.  9 billion dollars is PEANUTS for hedge funds. A single hedge fund or investment group can move 9 billion in a day, can you imagine what thousands of hedge funds around the globe can do?  There are INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS with more investing power/cash than all of WSB combined. This is not /biz/, this is not basement NEETS shilling shitcoins, this is big boy land with big boy people in suits in Manhattan skyscrapers and high class polish escorts going for 5k/hour. This is entire trading floors made up of Wharton MBA grads who come from old money, and most of you are just freshmen in the Derek Zoolander School of Options Trading, so shut the fuck up.  What we have going on here is .01% of WSB people are actually not completely retarded, and they SHARE their good DD with us which gives us the OPPORTUNITY to buy and make some money off hedge fund wars and hedge fund plays.  Learn some fucking humility and be grateful you made money off a dumb fucking purple mattress store or something equally stupid. You are literally a retarded ape if you think WSB can "fight hedge funds" or some dumb shit like that. 75% of you don't even know how to read.   #PLTR 28c 3/19 THE FIRE RISES
My gf and her bf are asleep, so I'll share my $F DD with you apes instead!
I'm confident that $F Ford is due for a downwards correction, and here's why:       First, let's look at immediate and previous trends.       What do you see? That's right, monkee, stock go down and then stock go up. Very good.       But why? Why stock go down go up?       Yes monkee you see right. Price break below support, break below trend, enter time of sad! But then other monkee buy! Say cheap! Stock price wedge! And lots monkee buy! So price break through wedge and resistance!  You see, monkee, wedge is strong, big pressure. If stock go up though wedge mean BIG UP! If stock go down through wedge mean BIG SAD! Like hole in coconut, stock pour!  But here, stock break free! Like hole in clouds. Stock go BIG UP!        Wedge easy see.        Wedge again? Yes, BIG UPS!        Awooga? Wedge again? YES, MONKEE! Monkee see. BIG UPS! Stock price break free of wedge and downwards trend! Stock is only go up!       BUT ACTUALLY STOCK GO DOWN FIRST    No be sad, monkee. All come up come down. Many monkee say "Stock too much up, too much banana."        This MACD chart. MACD show what other monkee think other monkee do.        When line cross, like snake cross river, stock go up or down. If river cross snake, big down. If snake cross river, big up! Now, river cross snake, so probably big down coming.   BUT NOT ALWAYS TRUE!    That is why, monkee, monkee see many charts. Monkee see many indicators! Monkee smart, monkee guess and check!    Monkee look at Bolinger Bands next!       This call Bolinger. Bolinger maker man say "When price is big in bolinger, price is overprice." and "When price is low in Bolinger, price is underprice." Monkee see, in Bolinger, price is overprice.   Bolinger also show if price is making ups too fast and downs too fast. When bolinger big, price ups and downs too fast! So you see, price making too big ups too big downs.  Not only this. Also Bolinger maker man say "When Bolinger is get more skinny, trend become backwards." So you see monkee, up trend be down trend soon!  But still! Monkee careful. No want lose banana! So monkee do more DD, be good monkee. Because last week, monkee lose all money on $GME and $SNDL. Bad monkee! Monkee no listen to reddit!        Monkee check RSI! RSI very good. When RSI in middle, stonk OK! When RSI is high, TOO MUCH MONKEE BUY! If stonk above purple, STONK IN DANGER, SELL NOW!  Not only this, but if RSI and STONK no match, mean trend go backwards! Name of this is called "Divergence". But little monkey head don't worry big words.  What monkee see is difference in graph. Stonk say I go up! RSI say I go down. Stock BIG UP when few monkee buy?! Not good. When this happen, listen to RSI. Bubble pop soon!  Some stupid man say "NO! RSI NO MEAN TOO MUCH BUY OR SELL!" But monkee, this how other monkee use RSI. And RSI very popular. So many other monkee now think same. So many monkee is want sell.   IF MONKEE WANT TO LOOK BY SELF, MONKEE SEE THAT RSI PREDICT $GME AND $SNDL BIG DOWN! MONKEE NO LOSE ALL BANANA IF LOOK AT RSI! Monkee sad, monkee learn, monkee make banana.        So what monkee talk to you think? Go up? Go down?       You see monkee, $F boring STONK! That why good for learn, good for trade. $F make boring car, not cool car like big dongerino friend $TSLA and friend Musk.  $F is sleepy, like follow trend. You see last $F go too much big from up trend so $F big crash and then go up again. Or even go down after.  So monkee talk to you think say this happen again.        Stock go up again with up trend, but first stock come down. No be sad. Monkee buy puts. Then when big down sell puts buy calls! Many banana! Ho ho ho!       TL;DR: AWOOOGA!      Too big up in trend   Too many monkee buy   Now cost up too much   River cross snake!  EDIT: I got silver ugh thank you king stranger 🤩💖🙈
Thank you for teaching me about making big money, wallstreetbets.
Through the start of 2020 I started Investing with 8k.  Got it up to 10k. Then with options back to 5k, and now to 50k this year due to cheapass tlry leaps and bcoin investments.    I was and I still am that same retard from day 1. I just got lucky, and I did learn some things about timing when to go in on option plays  Anyways this post is about how I actually learned what a tax free savings account is, a retirement account is, and about different investments. Aka STONKs, Options, ETFs like ARKG, and yah fuck the rest of the low money shit like mutual funds and index funds. Who the fuck wants 2-10% a year of returns during this eurphoric bull run?  I wanted to consider myself financially illerate. I didn't know shit about accounting, how to do taxes or how to build wealth. I started trading because I thought I could make some side money. I am also a lazy MF and had a okay job that paid 17/hr. But I was pretty much depressed.   Now I consider myself a well informed retarded gambler. The stock market has literally changed my life for the better, and has completely changed my outlook on money and how the system is there to teach people to work, not to be wealthy.   My fellow autist, you a smarter then most people who don't know jackshit about how much money you can make on the markets. Most people just give there money to the banks or just do passive investing(I have no issues with this, but missing out on great opportunities is super retarded).   To everyone who wrote dds and gave advice, thank you. I don't care if it was bad, because I learned a fuck ton because you autist think differently. I am ready to share as much helpful info back!  TLDR:   Love you guys full homo and STONKS and options =
GIVE ME TENDIES OR GIVE ME DEATH!!! (TSLA Yolo/DD/Bet)
I am god damn sick and god damn tired of all these pathetic newbies coming on here and taking away from the authentic WSB culture. Backing out of bets, selling after a dip, saying that we should actually do research before throwing our life savings into a play? It's fucking pathetic, disgraceful. I can hardly even fucking look at you half the time, you should all be ashamed of yourselves.  Every day we stray further from god. What actually brought us to this point? What gave all these degenerates enough capital to lose 10x their inital investment on margin? What first united us as a clan when all the hedgies and stonk brokers said we were going down? What was there before PLTR, GME, SNDL or AMC? Tslsa, Tsla, Tsla, and Tsla. Tesla is the primordial ooze that binds us retards together on the eternal path to tendie town.  To reinvigorate some WSB spirit, I've decided to do what I did last time after  , YOLO the rest of my life savings into TSLA calls and make it all back. By the end of next week I'll be fine dining only the most prestigious tendies on a private jet or my kids will be eating cat food I paid for with a second mortgage on my house. There is no in-between, this is the way. Now for the three-for-one:  # Due Diligence  Tesla literally can not go down next week. It is physically impossible to stray below it's current price point. The timeless syllogism of Tesla is known as modus ponens  Proposition 1: Stonks only go up  Proposition 2: Tsla is a stonk  Conclusion: Tsla only goes up, QED.  I know I've said it before but this literally cannot go tits up. It's like getting in at Gourds before they were a big hit. It's like that one dude who bought a lot of tranches or whatever the fuck before we knew about tranches. It's foolproof.    Huge upside potential with very little downside. Does that ring a bell?”     # Bet  If Tesla closes Friday above $900 I will be getting a Tesla tattoo on my ass cheek.  If Tesla closes Friday above $1000, that tattoo will be the size of a small watermelon.  Don't you dare even insult me by even asking if I'm going to follow through, I am. I'm not like these pussies who fake their bets harder than their wives fake their orgasms. You bet your sweet ass I will follow through.  # Yolo  Entirety of my   are officially in Tesla, for once I managed to buy close to the bottom and it's already went up a bit. Weeklies with a c785. The other couple calls expiring today  I will be closing at some point  and rolling into the next week's by the end of the day today, or Tuesday at open. It ain't much but it's honest work.
1M in Puts at   for TSLA???? Which one of you did this
Some fund is trying to pay a WSBer $200k+ to do FD's and they are too retarded to post it here. Apply here.
Apparently Cindicator Capital is run by ~~Hybrid~~ Inbred Intelligence, but they just aren't quite smart enough to understand the collective wisdom of r/wallstreatbets that I can boil down to just three letters:  GME.  To solve this, they want to hire a true autist (more than 1 year at Wallstreetbets and at least 1,000 karma--none from prayer threads) to guide them down wisdoms' paths specifically to play FD's (someone tell their HR department what that stands for...).  # They are paying $200k base + 30% of profits.  To help these morons out, I'm posting the job listing in full here, since that would have been the hybrid intelligent move in the first place.   I think we should all apply with a top line comment, and then make fun of the applicants in the thread.  Also, /u/dhsmatt2 :  your job sucks.   Apply for this one.     # The Posting (my comments added in parentheses)    About Cindicator Capital    Launched in 2019, Cindicator Capital is the first quantitative fund powered by Hybrid Intelligence    (makes you wonder how long it took to come up with that name)   .

Last year, we’ve built Macro Sentiment Indicators, a tool that tracks the moods of market participants to predict weekly movements of the S&P 500 and other instruments with 70% accuracy    (So, they've predicted the market with 70% accuracy since 2019... I can do better than that:  Stonks only go up.   That is more accurate than 70% since 2019)   .

If you're thinking weed (growers) is anything but a very short term deal, you're wrong.
How many of you have futures in corn? Wheat? Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice?   If/when it goes legal, weed will be like tobacco or soy beans. And all these growers that are mooning right now will be up in smoke.   The real long term play is SaaS. Maps of where to buy weed.   Yes. Growers are printing fantastically right now. But leaps? Or even trying to time puts? Silly stuff. Maps of weed. Mark my words and thank me later.
Weed Stocks
My shitty tip of the day -
PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DAY.  I used to not prepare and I was stressed while trading, watching every fucking thing as soon as the stocks open, then I learned that was dumb as hell of me to do.  Now every day before I go to bed I write out what stocks I will invest in the next day, what's my stop-loss, trailing %? Am I YOLOing it, or do I have a true game plan on how I will tackle the next day? I set Yahoo Finance to notify me, I place orders out of hours so I don't have to worry about being the first, I have a plan. It has gotten so much easier and convenient for me every day.     Edit: ALSO DON'T LISTEN TO SOME OF THE FUCKHEADS ON HERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ON HERE CAME AFTER GME (WHICH I'M SURE WE ALL KNOW AT THIS POINT) AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT THEY THINK BECAUSE THEY MADE A BIG GAIN THEY KNOW HOW IT WORKS!  DO YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW HOW STOCKS WORK?  I DON'T KNOW BUT SOMEHOW THE ADVISORS I LISTEN TO KNOW
I taught myself Chitubox just to steal this file and claim it as mine to post on WSB for karma (Source in Comments)
A Strong Case for the TLRY Shorts - Don't be left Holding a Bag
TLDR: Are you really going to tell me that a merged Tilray and Aphria warrants Tilray trading at 4x Google’s revenue multiple and 2x Tesla’s multiple when they don’t even have positive cash flows? No EBITDA? Don’t let yourselves get caught up in the hype brother monkeys.   EDIT: Stock go down. I have been wrong many times and this is in no way advice      EDIT:   Because some are bringing up "hurr durr bad multiple choices", here are some quick comparable companies:  OrganiGram:    Aphria:    Aurora:    HEXO: 16x  TerrAscend:      EDIT 2:   My bad I had the wrong conversion rate. It's late where I am. Just updated to reflect that. The point still stands: It's not that I'm bearish on weed as a whole - I think TLRY's rise compared to its peers in the industry is may present a bear opportunity.        Listen up y’all. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‘round. Remember, true diamond hands don’t care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to  their own profits. Now let’s learn some basic corporate finance together.  We need to talk about TLRY.  As you all know, TLRY spiked today…and the day before…etc…up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I’m proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I’m here to explain why.  Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I’m not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I’m going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I’m going to use only numbers directly from TLRY’s merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find  .  Let’s start with two basic facts:  TLRY Current Share Count:   million  APHA Current Share Count:   million  Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company – nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria’s stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of   This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.  We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.  Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!  Carrying on with the valuation…we add the merged company’s debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) – and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.  Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, “Why do multiples matter?”. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to…  Let me say that again:   That’s saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.        Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!  I just want to make sure you all don’t get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don’t tell me “it’s about the potential”. Potential isn’t realized through a press release, and you know it.  Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren’t even US focused. Seriously – read their securities filings.  Also, keep in mind this merger was announced in December, and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then. WHY THE RUNUP? You're getting fleeced lads.
Being on the other side of the weed stock rally
So weed stocks have been pumping this week. The only catalyst I've found for that is Virginia passing a bill that will legalize it by 2024(   )  TLRY, APHA, ACB, SNDL, are some of the stocks being bought. My question, is why are people investing in Canadian based weed growers/distributors on potential for it to be federally legal in the United States? Why would it be profitable for the US to import all of its weed in the case that it does become legal on a federal level? Don't international trade tariffs and everything else that goes iwth importing foreign goods make it less than ideal, when compared to growing it domestically? Sure, there is some % that is legal imported for medical use, and research pruposes (TLRY and CGC) but how much is really being imported today, and will it stay like that if its federally legalized in the US. It's not like its that hard to grow it here either - most of the US has a climate for it, and if it doesn't you can build greenhouses. Am I missing something here?  The problem is, there don't seem to be any US based, publicly traded weed growers/distributors. So people just flocked to the Canadian ones. I don't get it.
APHA reverse merger w/ TLRY - let math make you money
Did you miss out on all the pot stock hype today? Good news there is still a great sleeper play out there . This has been discussed in r/stocks and here in WSB weeks and it’s simple merger math.   Buy APHA not TLRY.  Why? Because APHA will convert to TLRY shares for a profit at a .838 to one. In other words 100 shares of APHA will convert to   TLRY shares.  One TLRY share at close was $   and one APHA only $   83% of $  is $   APHA is trading at a $28 per share discount!   APHA is a great company and actually the one buying TLRY (Reverse merger) the two are poised to do very well with legalization and the tickers will switch in the 2Q of This year.

Wallstreetbets State of the Subreddit
Wallstreetbets is unique on reddit because of its... "culture". We are all here for a single reason: To make money on high risk plays.  Gains made overnight, or by holding through hell and high water, are to be equally celebrated.   Losses should be mocked, derided, and if unique enough, given the high honor of being put into automod.  At all costs, if we are to remain different than the rest of reddit, we must avoid the following:    Politics, we're not here to change the world (sorry) - we just like the stock.    Divisiveness, calling people bots and shills because they disagree with you only reduces diversity of thought, and drives away our best members.    Repetitive content, we have just barely enough IQ points to focus on multiple stocks at once, not everything has to be GME or Weedstocks.    Know it alls, remember rule 7 - "No Bullshitting". Stay humble and ask about what you don't know. After being insulted a few times, someone will help you out.     #What you can do to keep this place great    Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.    Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.    Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!    Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.    Don't ask "what the next move is" - WSB is not your personal army, there is no agenda, no one speaks for WSB, and we don't "pump and dump" anything. Simply, we are a watering hole for risk loving individuals.     #What we're doing to keep this place great    The whole mod team has been working overtime, clearing out low quality content and keeping things fresh. Less than 1% of threads make it out of /new.    In the absence of u/zjz's incredible bots, we're building new tools to assist with moderation efforts, but remain hopeful that zjz can return soon.    We're planning some fun community events. Can't say too much, but those of you who have been around will know. Guess we'll have to wait and see.    We will be reintroducing stickied DD threads. These will be automatically stickied based on flair, with high account age restrictions.     #Why was my post/comment removed? CORRUPT!  Over the past week, there were multiple  really good  DDs and YOLOs on PRPL, FNKO, SNDL, and many other stocks. The kind of stuff that gives you hope that the old WSB is very much alive.  But you may have missed them because the front page was dominated with GME related talk.   Don't let the bandwagoners steal your fresh DD. Downvote spam and low effort posts, upvote innovative posts.     #A note on the moderation team:  The team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.  This mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.  Making everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, stick around. You'll have a blast.    Dear SEC Intern: We don't endorse any tickers or movements. We're just here to trade and make dick jokes.
NTDOY is the most undervalued company, how do you not see this?
Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:  1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...  2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...  3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?  4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...  5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.  6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those,   million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.  7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.  8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of  ! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by   and the Net Profit by a similar   How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE 😮  Price target? Do I look like an analyst? I'm just a retard who likes     and playing games on the couch while eating tendies. Maybe one day we'll be playing Nintendo games on Mars.
💡$LUMN💡 Blowout Earnings: $  EPS vs. $  expected
# Hello again my beautiful apes  💡  $LUMN  💡 had a blow out earnings today, as we all expected.     Link to my previous DD post:        # $  EPS vs. $  expected.  The "Street" is sleeping on this giant.  You can read their full summary here:     I picked up more shares at $  during the after-hours dip.     # Numbers    Earnings   (that's right, this company makes money. what a concept  )     for fiscal year 2020 were $  billion compared to $  billion for the year before.   Have you ever seen a boomer telecom company grow   earnings   by   YoY, despite a minor dip in top line revenue?  I don't think so.  Leadership over at 💡  $LUMN  💡 has one thing on their mind: 🤑      Since the original DD post, a fellow ape   told me that learning  multiplication  would help me with my financial analyses. So I'll try that here.   At an after-hours price per share of $  with 1,085,666,000 shares outstanding, that puts the   P/E ratio   for the past fiscal year at      .      BURRY   wasn't joking when he sniffed out the value here.      You might look at the report and see "-$ " EPS, but this is due to an accounting trick to write off the boomer parts of the business that they're divesting of.  Do the math yourself, retard.     # Congratulations to everyone who has followed me, and by proxy BURRY.  We may see a dip in the next few days because the market hates companies that make money, but don't fear. I'll personally be picking up more calls tomorrow if we continue to dip.  If you like 🤑 then don't sleep on 💡  $LUMN  💡  Shares and LEAPS are the way to go.     disclaimer:  I am not a financial adviser, nor is this financial advice.

Hexo, go easy on me first DD
Who’s ready to here the why HEXO can      itself to becoming a major player in weed  1. Why would you ever put money into a HEXO that’s up over 100% in the last month that just went through a 4/1 reverse split to be eligible to be put on the NYSE???  Well let me answer that question for you children. HEXO OWNS THE #1 POSITION IN WEED DRINKS IN CANADA! They own   of Truss, A company that is targeting the 71% of Canadian pussies who get turned off of weed because they have to smoke it. I’ve never met someone who hates being high (under the correct circumstances) but I know a lot of people who hate it smoke. What if they can 🍹 it?? Do you understand the potential, currently weed beverages are currently   of the Canadian market (  US), experts agree that weed bev’s can grow to 15% weeds total sales  2. But let’s talk about how much money are they are losing... because they did lose $170m million in the Q2. They only lost   in Q3  . Not to mention CGC, currently having one of the largest market cap evaluations at 20B market cap only posted 440M net rev, compared to HEXO’s 41M with only a   market cap. Now let’s get to what everyone wants to here about. Are they really growing though?   3. TLDR on weed stance   Heavily invested in Quebec, Greece, and Colorado. They aren’t branding any further currently (waiting for American legalization imo). They produce way more bud then they can sell but because the price of a gram has fallen from   last year to under $3 now they have been able to ram up sales and cut their net losses to only 4milly last q. They are still producing 50% more weed than they can sell ready for a wave of legalization to expand their cannibals reach.  Main highlights highlights. Up 114% in gross revenue from the comparative prior year. Net revenue is up 103%. Expanding reach into Alberta(18% total sales), Ontario(15%), and British Columbia(6%). They have the #1 market share in Quebec. Each province having a strong tourist presence. They currently have 150m in straight cash.  THE PLAY: Almost my entire portfolio  March 29th Q2 earnings  If they can report positive earnings this stock can

Made a donation to a small business owners relief fund with some of my profits from SNDL today. #WSBGivesBack
lets discuss the most talked about stock in the last few weeks.
hopefully mods dont delete this one. 3rd time trying to post this.    The SEC has previously warned that short sellers can hide their shorts through some trickery with the help of market makers. Well we have data reported by FINRA showing how much naked short selling was done by market makers through the end of January too, there was an explosion of   million shares of Short Exempt Volume by market makers, which could have been used to help short sellers hide their positions. (FINRA notes they don’t capture all data, and their total trading volume seems to be a little less than half that shown on Yahoo Finance. Thus presumably to account for the full trading volume of activity we need to more than double the   FINRA publishes. In other words     million shares could have been hidden by market makers given the high Short Exempt Volume through the end of January  .)  \--    of the data pulled from FINRA, notice the jump in Short Exempt Volume highlighted in yellow starting January 13th, showing market makers selling naked shorts. Notice how the Short Exempt Volume has only grown as we moved into February, even though overall trading volume has trended down. This indicated to me that the market makers might be playing a larger role in hiding even more shorts in February potentially.  Combining the official short shares and the potentially hidden short shares, we get to   million shares, representing 67% of float at the end of January.  \--  FINRA data shows short sales represented more than half of FINRA trading volume throughout February, leading to the conclusion shorts have been increasing their stake against the company again opportunistically at higher prices this month. Some of the shorting likely was done by high frequency algos that typically close their position by day end, but the short volumes were so high it would be impossible to close all the shorts out given the limited volume. If there were no other buyers, and only short sellers opening and closing their positions throughout February, conservatively there would be a net   million new shorts that went unclose based on FINRA data, and if that is inflated to account for the trading volume FINRA is not capturing, then there may have been a total of     million new shares shorted in February  .  \--  Bringing it all together.    million short shares officially reported by FINRA for end of January.  \  million shares potentially hidden by market makers through Short Exempt Volume in January.  \  million new shares shorted through February 9th.      million shares short in total through February 9th by my estimates, representing 129% of float presently.    \--  The table below shows a rough estimate of the cumulative portion of shorts that would be underwater with losses at each price point. This was roughly estimated using the price ranges and short volumes by trading day. A  t a $50 share price around 40% of the shorts are underwater by my estimates, and at a $100 share price around 75% would be underwater, and by a price of $150 more than 80% of shorts would be underwater.   In other words, going above those price points would put pressure on an increasingly larger portion of the shorts to close out their positions.  $450 = 98%  $400 = 96%  $350 = 94%  $300 = 92%  $250 = 88%  $200 = 84%  $150 = 81%  $100 = 74%  $50 = 42%  \--  This analysis can be improved upon with more detailed trading volume data by the minute, but this was based on day end volumes and price ranges. It also assumes the official short shares reports by FINRA at the end of January only represent about a third of all the shorts that actually exist today. Despite being very rough estimates, these are intended to illustrate the prices that may potentially be key pain point prices for short sellers.  \--    TLDR - shorts are hiding their shorts position which the SEC is aware of. A lot of short exempt volume in the last couple of weeks. Short interest is most likely at 129% vs 78%.        position - 200 @ $68  I am not a financial advisor blah blah blah
Here we go my! TLRY      to the mooon!!!
Reddit’s Valuation Doubles to $6 Billion After Funding Round

Weedstocks, the new WSB darling
After surviving the 2016-2018 weedstonks rise and fall, I have one thing to share about picking horses:  Pick operationally profitable companies.  Most of the tickers thrown around in this sub havn’t had a single profitable quarter. Sure revenues are up, costs are down but the revenues aren’t up enough and costs aren’t down enough. Can this business operate in the black today? Because if they can’t then expansing to a larger facility won’t solve their woes.   There’s a saying in martial arts: If you can’t do it slow, you can’t do it fast. So pick a weed grower that can grow and sell their product for a profit. This should be the backbone of any op. Income from stakes in other businesses or changes in valuation of inventory are some tricks used to cook the books. You’ll see many of these tickers issue shares, warrants whatever and that is your sign to gtfo.  So who is profitable? AFAIK APHA pre-TLRY merger. I’m not confident APHA can turn around the TLRY operation. I’d look at MSOs that are operating in the black for my picks for the coming green rush. Good luck all and remember: SHIT WEED DONT SELL.
The weed rally has nothing to do with GME
No, the upward movement in cannabis stocks is not a concerted distraction by Wall Street to take attention away from GME. Believe it or not, but a global stock market can contain numerous trends all at once. The weed stocks rallied because of the belief that broader cannabis legalization is possible in the next 12-18 months under a Biden administration. Remember: the   House of Representatives passed a bill decriminalizing cannabis last December, only for that legislation to die in the Senate, still controlled by the GOP. Now that Dems have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, cannabis has a much more clear and easy path towards legalization. Obviously that would be enormous for the marijuana industry, so people are grabbing shares now, ahead of the potential explosion in growth. Also, a lot of these stocks were shorted and are now getting squeezed. None of this has anything to do with GME.
Been bagholding in the Weed sector for 2+ years...  🏼 made those bags a little lighter this week!

Note on weed stocks - UK regulatory changes
One thing that may have slipped un-noticed is that late 2020 the UKGov relaxed some of its conditions around which companies can float on the LSE that have connections to weed. Historically the thing that stopped it being possible is the proceeds of crime act. Today MCG pharma floated who are a medicinal marijuana company. As a resident of the UK I feel there is going to be a big media and public push for rapid legalisation soon as it is a full no-brainier and I know nobody who is vehemently against it.  They have clearly started to look at this in Westminster and given the Tories progressive agenda coupled with a need for new industries to grow I think that looking at companies with Uk access is a great start. With Brexit done and Canada’s commonwealth links I can see big opportunities on the horizon for certain Canadian weed conglomerates.  If it happens it is huge. We Brits have lots of money and love the drugs!
$ZOM ($  - Zomedica Corp is about to skyrocketing and only a few are realizing it.

Now to the post.  &nbsp;    #Zomedica Overview  Based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Zomedica (NYSE American:ZOM) is a veterinary health company creating products for companion animals (canine, feline and equine) by focusing on the unmet needs of clinical veterinarians. Zomedica’s product portfolio will include   innovative   diagnostics and therapeutics that emphasize patient health and practice health. With a team that includes clinical veterinary professionals, it is Zomedica’s mission to provide veterinarians the opportunity to lower costs, increase productivity, and grow revenue while better serving the animals in their care.  &nbsp;  #Investors  Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp.

TRUFORMA is a point-of-care machine that uses bulk acoustic waves (BAW) technology to detect & diagnose adrenal diseases (in dogs) and thyroid diseases (in dogs and cats). This compact machine delivers results in ~18 mins and carries 70+ global patents.  TRUFORMA does not require pre-market regulatory approval for use with companion animals in the United States.    &nbsp;  #Major competitor  The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off   to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.    &nbsp;  #News and upcoming catalysts  Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.  &nbsp; When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a  BOUGHT DEAL  to rise   millions dollars at $  per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $  per share.  &nbsp; Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.  &nbsp;  As of today Zomedica is   DEBT FREE    &nbsp; The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.  &nbsp; By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.  &nbsp; More technical data can be found at:    &nbsp;   This is one of the few stocks that realized gains today.

The next GME-like short squeeze?
Jfc peeps  There will not be another GME for like a  decade   These kinds of things are legend for a reason  You're not gonna catch em slippin like this again  This happened because of a convergence of coincidences that no one foresaw - it was dumb luck  Hence some were actually caught with their pants down and paid dearly for it - and for you to be in on it in time is pure dumb luck  squared   To you retards who are trying to look for another:   Stop trying to make "retail short squeeze" happen its not gonna happen,      especially just weeks after GME     All the institutions know about GME and have reevaluated/adjusted their positions  "CoUlD tHiS bE aNoThEr ShOrT sQuEeZe??" NO - ITS BULLSHIT  TL;DR   #   STAHP IT YOU RETARDS     _____  Edit:   I'm  not  talking about the actual GME short squeeze or the short interest of it or if there's any juice left to it  I am talking more about the  circumstances from which it originated  and how it is silly to say, listen to articles or posts claiming there will be another short squeeze in a similar vain as GME

BB Stock long term. A future player in electric vehicles?
Okay boys and girls, there has been a lot of speculation on blackberry and how the future of the company will play out.  The main appeal for investing in BB involves the electric vehicle industry since BB is developing a QNX software that will run autonomous vehicles.  Blackberry’s QNX platform is designed to protect data communication within the vehicle and the “product makes the countless nodes of data communication in embedded systems functionally safe.”  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) has partnered with BB to use the QNX software in their vehicles. If Blackberry plays its cards right, the QNX software could be used in a multitude of different things. They could implement the QNX software into multiple car makes and models, and even use the software in other types of vehicles outside of just automobiles.  On the other hand, BB's QNX software could crumble if it is not competitive and there are better options for car manufacturers.  So what is everyone's opinion on BB? Why should you invest in them, and/or why shouldn't you invest in them? I am still doing my research and would love to talk about this.  EDIT: BB is also very strong in cybersecurity. 9/10 of the worlds largest banks use BB security software to secure data.
We are not in a bubble.
It's easy to be a billionaire when you write the storyline. Hopefully people here are bright enough to realize that GME wasn't the only thing the media lied about. Look around the world right now, blind people leading the blind with dead eyes and face muzzles. Psychological programming forcing a shift into new systems that can be profited from. Massively. Capitalism is EXPANDING into entirely new markets.   Virtual reality, biometrics, social impact bonds, telecommunication, genomics, data, cloud storage, robotics, big tech, bl0ckcha1n.   The internet of things (and of bodies) industries will quadruple within 5 years. We are not in a bubble. We are at the bottom of a mountain, looking up.   We can't stop what is happening with the world right now, but if we understand the game being played, we can profit off of it too.
Weed stocks for long term?
What’s the probability that weed will be legalized on a federal level soon? If not this year then by the next? I’m looking into a few stocks like SNDL HUGE OGI APHA TLRY. I know they’re being hyped right now but I truly feel that they’re undervalued specially with the current political situation. Any other stocks I should be mindful of? Also weed ETF is literally called YOLO so idk what more of a sign I need.  Edit 1: Thank you for the funny reddit awards! Now buy some weed stocks and make some 💰
Pass the bong and gather round, bros! We're gonna   were we doing again? Oh yeah, we're gonna talk about those Chronic stocks and how you Ganja Gorillas can avoid becoming Game Gibbons
Hay hay, Ay, listen up, B, lemme holler at you a minute.  I notice you been eyeing that portfolio real luscious like, almost like you found a couple extra bananas under your tree, am I right?     Cool, cool.  So whatchu holdin', homey?   Tillllllray?  Aw yiss.  Aphria?  Yeah, she fine as hell.  CGC?  Oh lawd, dat ass is bangin'.  ACB?  Aw man, you like the classics, that's dope.  OGI?  Into the up and comers, respect young blood.  SNDL?     SNDL?  For real?  Dude....     Hi all, NrdRage here.  You might remember me from such hits as "pegging $GME dead right multiple times during its bubble, making everybody rich on $RIOT, exposing the $PLUG infinite money glitch, accidentally helping start the $BB craze, never getting an $AMD weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the VIX" or maybe "The SEC and you:  How you can just say no to having them shove a Mister Fister up your ass".  Alright, apes, it's been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks, you make money.  It's been a great run.  But if you're going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with, you gotta start thinking a bit.  And that means - hear me out - thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of SNDL alive.  And yes, I realize I'm saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours.  Look, I was playing it, too.  I grabbed some 2/19 3c's and a shit ton of 1/22  's on Tuesday.  I also got out of both of those today, though not as high up as I could have.  If you check my history, you'll see I even said I was goingt to eye a re-entry.  Then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry, but I passed on it because I had done some research by that point.  Whatever, profit's profit.     Here's the TL:DR:  It's basically a penny stock that's gotten pumped to hell.  But the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees.     Hey, I love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy, I ain't gonna talk shit about that.  But it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this, and I'm starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about Holding to   and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly don't even know what they fuck they've invested in that the GME Gibbons fell for.     # Here's the reality of SNDL:     The company was on the verge of bankruptcy around Thanksgiving, they have no other markets other than Canada, which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram.  And they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet THC content requirements.     In case you're wondering what that means, it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper.  They sell garbage.  And everyone knows it - their brand is associated with low quality crap.     Plus, they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price, then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering.  Now, to their credit, this not only enabled them to become debt free, but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand.  Don't get too excited, fucking Sam's Choice at Wal-Mart is a brand, too, doesn't mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum.  By reason of them selling skunkweed, their margins lag well behind that of their competitors.     Looking at their financials, they've got 615 million in cash laying around.  That's pretty good - except  they're a company that burns 250 million a quarter.  Which means they're going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month.  They've got no exposure to the US market, but had no problem dropping "rumors" that they were going to break in to the US market through licensing deals - which turned out to be 1 pot shop in Bellingham, Washington.  They have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world, for that matter.     #   NRDRAGE!  Stonk go up !  Look at it!  SNDL to the moon!          ).     Yeah, I know.  It's fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when it's seemingly mid flight.  But here I am anyways.  Not to talk you out of the weed party - you should totally keep playing that for all it's worth - but rather to get people to see that they've probably outgrown skunkweed now.     Look, the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar.  Hell, it was 13 cents not too far back.  With a stock worth a dollar, it's easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz.  It's easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere.  But as the price goes up, so too goes up the perceived cost of entering.  I can make a strong (unassailable, in fact), argument that $APHA at $25 is cheaper than SNDL at    But people are conditioned to like smaller numbers.  Unfortunately, as the GME Gibbons learned, eventually you run out of buyers, and then things go tits up real fast.     As the Prophet Biggie Smalls once said, Mo' Money Equals Mo' Problems.  We all know this equation to be true.  And here you are, sitting on bags of bananas you didn't know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadn't heard of before yesterday.  You don't think you've got a problem, but you do.  Because those bags of bananas aren't edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash.  If you're sitting on  bananas from the gold standard of the weed world (that would be, $TLRY), you're resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas.  There are gonna be lots of bananas to go around, and mostly we're just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later.  But you don't have that with SNDL.  All the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher.  You can't all be right, especially when there are billions of bananas, and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some Boomer on CNBC told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler.     # Again, I'm not telling you to leave the party     But, if you recall your dorm room years, the best pizza you could afford was the Tony's school lunchroom style shit for a dollar.  Then you managed to  hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans, and you upgraded to Domino's.  Maybe by now you're ordering from a local joint that makes it's own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old Italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it.  That just makes it taste better.  That's science.  But I digress.     The point is, you can get better weed now.  You don't have to smoke the skunk.  So before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again, maybe you should elevate your enterprise.  Let's take a look at your options:     # Canopy Growth  You could go with $CGC.  They not only sell higher quality weed, but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think Burning Man isn't just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their "luck".  They've captured that all important 65+ stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures, cataracts, and dry vag, so they've got a lot of revenue.  They've also had a much more muted rise this week because they just haven't been on everybody's lips, which means they've got a lot of room to run.  The downside here is they burn almost as much cash as SNDL, but they've also got more bullets.     # Aurora  If you go with $ACB, you're going with a company that's already gone through its "shady as fuck" stage and has re-emerged healthy from it.  You're also not only getting on weed, but the DIY urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed.  They, too, have had a strong run, but have a lot more runway than most because they've actually got a really strong path to dominance in the US market once it opens up to them.     # Organigram:     Look, if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or you've only got 28 dollars to invest, you could do a lot worse.  They've got strong branding, large growth potential, a management structure that doesn't seem to act shady, and they've run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks, but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit.     # Tilray and Aphria:     I'm combining these because they're inexorably joined at the hip (or should be, more on that later) because the two of them are merging.  For those who don't know, sometime in Q2, every share of $APHA you own will turn into .833 shares of $TLRY.  Even though APHA is the one buying out TLRY.    This is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery.  When you start investing in these, you know you're a real investor.     Here's the interesting thing with these guys, though.  Even though APHIA should be just slightly trailing behind TLRY in terms of stock price, it's currently trading at less than half.  With TLRY sitting at 73 a share as I write this, APHA should be at just over $60.  But it's at 29.  Now, obviously, this means that TLRY has a lot more momentum, and some of that is due to the fact that there's a mini (don't flog me for using the word, but it's true) short squeeze going on with that one, which has turned it into such a strong momentum play.  But APHA, by virtue of actual math, needs to be within about 17% of TLRY's price.  Which means APHA either needs to moon dramatically, or TLRY needs to fall precipitously.  Now either of those things could happen, but the momentum of TLRY is hard to stop, which means it's more likely that APHA rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months.  Even if TLRY does falter, that means APHA still has to come up a bit to meet it.  Making APHA kind of a "can't go tits up" situation.  TLRY also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it, whereas SNDL is too small to meet most of their requirements.    Which can further propel TLRY (and thus, drag APHA with it).     One of the interesting things that's been happening with this pair is that the order books, even though they should mirror one another, have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days.  This, of course, was a bull flag for TLRY every time it happened, leaving APHA to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter.  It's really easy money.     Fundamentally, these guys have one HUUUUUUUGE advantage over the others:  They secured the UK distribution, and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the Europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them.  And if you don't think they won't be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the US opens for business, then you definitely ain't black.     # Or, you can just stay where you are and do the     thing     Ask the $GME Gibbons how well that worked out for them.  The ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the Viper Room, still rocking his mullet and chain wallet, just convinced that Warrant and Slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that Queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again.  It's just sad.  You're flying right now, but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then you're gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that it's gonna be OK and that you're gonna ride it to a thousand one day.  Lots of us (myself included) made a fuck ton of money on GME.  And we've made a fuck ton on SNDL and the rest of the Weedies this week.  But there are always people who Melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck.  That's gonna be a lot of you, but you shouldn't let it be you.     # TL:DR:  Smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from SNDL while you're way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes.  Plaintains equals breeding with better apes, not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases.

$BMBL Big time play
$BMBL  I will be going in HEAVY on this one.   Reasons being:  1) Covid. The amount of single people right now outweigh people in relationships (loser lost of you autists fucking your hand)  2) GME AMC and all that brought an entire new species of people to be trading.  3) A lot of the new traders are looking to make back their bucks from GME AMC etc 4) People can relate to and with Bumble. All of them are on it or using it to get laid so therefore I think it will have a ton of people interested.   Hopefully there will be options availabe.   “BMBL IPO couldn’t be timed better. IAC has seen its shares rocket up 225% in the past year as stuck-at-home people turned to apps for social connections...”  Source:    Let’s be real here IAC owns March and Tinder. Not only is bumble better than both but IAC is at ~$250 currently.   BMBL is coming in Low, BIIIIIIIG LOW.    This isn’t financial advice, don’t listen to me cause I have not a clue what I’m doing.
HIMX - the tendies were absent today (February 10, 2021)...
No change; better than down, however.       Moving forward, I think I'll start posting HIMX stuff weekly instead of daily, and post it as a DISCUSSION.      My thoughts on HIMX have not changed.  I still think it's still in a major upcycle - with some possible pullbacks and consolidation, which is a good thing.  Allows folks the chance to get some who didn't have the opportunity before.        Congrats to all who jumped (or will jump) aboard this rocket ship!
At what point are we going to realize OUR MONEY WAS STOLEN FROM US?
RH, Citadel, and other Federal Reserve cronies blocked the squeeze a couple weeks back. I know it is a hard pill to swallow. Like most victims of scammers, you are too embarrassed to admit you have been scammed.  By blocking the squeeze, they literally took  money from our pockets. Your money is gone. GME, BB, AMC, et al. stocks were counterfeited, the price reduced, and your money is gone.   Believing that the federal reserve is going to allow you to fuck up their scamming game called the stock market is laughable.   I lost some money too, but not a lot. If you want to hold, by all means, d so. But, to buy this stock thinking it's going to go back up to $500+, it's preposterous.   When you bet, sometimes you lose. When you bet against the federal reserve: heads they win- tails you lose.   #RH and The Dudes at The Federal Reserve STOLE OUR MONEY  #Thieves
BBY-Best Buy Stockholders
I don’t know if anyone here holds any stock in Best Buy but as a head’s up... Best Buy is cutting thousands of their employees today in order to help the bottom line and stroke off investors. Seeing it in r/bestbuy. Many employees that have stock are mentioning selling it in order to backfire CEO’s plans. I have a lot of old coworkers planning on doing the same. So one could speculate to prepare for a drop in prices. At least in the short term. But also keep in mind that less employees in an already short staffed company means lower customer satisfaction and less shoppers.  Not insider trading, the company cuts are all over their subreddit. Do with the information as you will.  Happy investing.  Edit: Short term :), long term :( Not financial advice, just information.
$BA, the hidden golden egg
So, I'm pretty retarded. Been here for a few months, know a bit, but I'm more of an expert in aircraft. Recently, as you may know, Boeing suffered several major issues with their 737 MAX aircraft, resulting in a 100 USD plunge. Soon after, the Corona virus appeared no less than a year later, resulting in an additional 200 USD plunge. They couldn't just stop the production line, and thus it resulted in Boeing having to    However, that's not important. What is important is the recent news that the 737 MAX is now allowed to fly once again, after being grounded since early 2019. This is also in line with the vaccine role out, which is likely going to result in a $BA surge back to it's original price or higher, due to the significant want to travel. Luckily for Boeing, they've got dozens of aircraft already prepped for use, they just need to sell them again. While the stock has been slow to recover, it looks like it will rebound and swing for the fences as airports reopen and people want to travel after being locked inside for so long, leading to a lucrative opportunity in the near future.   TL;DR    Afternote: if anyone wants to check this and double check my retarded ramblings and maybe put some math behind this, I'd greatly appreciate it.   Not a financial advisor, Advise yourself with caution and skepticism. Current position: 8 @ 211
WHEN THE SQUEEZETH DOTH SQUOZE
My wife's boyfriend suggested i stop pacing around the bedroom excitedly during their private time so I wrote this poem instead:  When the squeezeth doth squoze,    my debt will be paid, my medical bills cleared. My shit-car I’ll trade, my wife’s boyfriend shall fear.   When the squeezeth doth squoze,   Banan fall from sky, Citadel shall cry. So hold my fries—The dips, I BUY.   When the squeezeth doth squoze,   The tendie man come, Melvin will run TO WHEREVER THE FUDGE MELVIN CAME FROM.   When the squeezeth doth squoze,   My model S will arrive. Papa Elon, Apes thrive! Hedgies: take the dive, Your strat is contrived   When the squeezeth doth squoze.   The bots will glitch, this battle is pitched.  DFV won’t bow to Mitch, SOON WE’LL BE RICH   When the squeezeth doth squoze!   So diamond hands mates, keep holding them tight. Rockets away, only way's up, keep Mars in sight.

The Wall the Fish Built - Path to the Moon Part 3
Once upon a time a bunch of   Retarded Fish   began   Holding   up a wall to keep some snakes out.   Because they were fish and they were retarded they did not know why they were keeping the wall up, they just kept holding. And holding, and holding. As the wall got   smaller   and   smaller   and   smaller  .  This inevitably   cost the fish   lots of energy. So much energy that getting the wall any higher seemed an impossibility. The retarded fish had   no other ideas   and they bickered with each other and snapped at each other for many days.   Along came a Snail with an   idea so obvious   to him that it was   laughable   that the fish could not see it. Maybe they were just   too close to the problem  . Maybe they were   greedy   and each fish wanted the wall for himself. Maybe they were all retarded. Maybe   they enjoyed being anally reamed  . That it was a pleasure for them to be penetrated so.   The idea was simple. All it really involved was   leverage  . But the retarded fish didn't understand what leverage meant. They   gave that up to build the wall   in the first place. They had no idea what leverage looked like when they had it themselves. Stupid retarded fish,   leverage is what you are holding,   spoke the Snail.  By dropping that wall, falling back and building the wall at   lower level  , with many   more fish  . They could build a wall that would keep the snakes out. All it would take is some coordination between the   Big Fish   and the   Little Fish  . The   Little Fish   could   retreat   and get ready to build the wall from a   comfortable foundation  . The   Big Fish   could   throw stones   at the snakes   one at a time.   Potentially knocking one out. Once at a level that was desirable and   approachable   from both Big Fish and Little Fish, the Wall could be built on   solid foundations  . Gradually the Fish could   collect stones   for the next push forward   with reinforcements  .  The   Snakes   would relish the opportunity for advancement and   overextend themselves  . They would lead themselves into a   point of no return  . But for the tenacity of the Retarded Fish. Once they get an idea in their heads, it is very hard to change their minds.  But the retarded fish thought the Snails idea was stupid. "  Leverage  ," they said "What's a wall got to do with   Leverage  ? Go away crazy Snail. You clearly don't know anything about walls or how to build them. We spent all this energy building this   stupid shitty wall   to this height, you want us to   take it down  . You sound like a snake, you sound like a robot! Psssh...   Leverage  , who does this Snail think he is?!"  The Snail sighed again, as looked upon the struggling fish. He forgave them for their insults. They   did not recognise him   or know he was. They could not see past his   clever disguise,   disguised as a Snail as he was. They did not   know the names   he carried with him in his time. Or the   many battles he had already won  , very similar to this one. If he told them they would never believe him, the Retarded Fish   only believed what was on the screen   in front of them.   As the image of the Wall went down   and down and further down and back up again and down again. Caught in an   endless stalemate  .    Poor Retarded Fish  ! Such a   simple existence   they must get to live, building a wall, only to watch it fall down again and again... It must be   so hard   being Retarded Fish all day. If only they would   try the Snails idea   even if   for lack of a better one  . It's not as if they weren't a   bunch of losers   already.     Determined   they were,   to waste more energy  . The Wise Snail looked on and laughed as each day passed and   the Wall the Retarded Fish Built got smaller and smaller  .    Silly fish, silly fish,       all thinking as one      couldn't they all see,      that all their ideas were dumb!

Gold is the way! [BTG] [AUY] DD    🥇🥇🥇
Hello my fellow apes!  I'm here today to tell you about 2 good gold miner stocks I did my DD on, B2Gold \[$BTG\] and Yamana Gold \[$AUY\]!  My DD on B2Gold goes as follows. ITS UNDERVALUED! BTG produces 1 million OZ of Shiny pretty GOLD a year, has practically no debt (121k as of start of 2020). Half a billion cash on hand! Has a P/E Ratio of 8. The dividend the company pays is $  quarterly. The sales revenue in 2015 was   Million and in 2019 it was   Billion, year 2020 will probably top 2019 since gold price went up. Total assets of the company are at around   Billion while the liabilities are   Million. Gross Income in 2019 was $  Million. The price of a stock is currently sitting at $  Which is laughably undervalued .       Yamana Gold \[$AUY\] Slightly worse than B2Gold but still worthy stonk! Price per share currently at $  Total debt at the beginning of 2020 was $991K. Gross Income in 2019 was $446 Million. It has a dividend of   quarterly . P/E Ratio of 40 which is kind of poor. But the company is still worth way more than the sub $5 price it's currently at! The company is targeting production of gold to exceed 1 million oz per year! It also produces silver which is an additional bonus!      Full disclosure I'm 2000 Shares deep in B2Gold, average at $  and 700 shares in Yamana Gold with an average of $  per share. 🤲 🤲  I'm an idiot so this is not financial advice but with the money printer going Brrrrrr I believe Gold miners will have a good year in 2021.
TLRY DD:   gainz
I'll keep this short because my smooth brain cant make long posts.   TLRY is going to the moon. Today it closed at $  and is now sitting at $  after hours as I write this. The highest call option for Friday the 12th is $65. There are a total of 30,555 option contracts listed in the option chain. If TLRY closes above $65 on Friday, I think there will be a lot of buying pressure. Also, the latest short interest report from 1/29 listed a short interest of 51% of the float. Perhaps many of those shorts were closed today during the massive trading volume today. Perhaps they werent.   TLRY also was granted clearance to import and distribute their products in the UK this week. Last week they were given the first (and only) clearance to sell their medical cannabis products in portugal. Looking at the news articles, it seems they are also selling in Spain and Germany.  No sources listed since you shouldnt take my smooth brain word for it.   My positions: 15 shares of Tilray bought at $36 and 27 shares of Apharia bought at $   Tldr: TLRY

Something seems off in the matrix
Things don’t feel real at this point of time. I feel like we’re all being led by some puppet master and the euphoric feeling of winning over takes our concerns with the real issue of big brother manipulation.  All stocks tanked at 10am and no one asks why. Most with normal volume have the same recovery pattern. Ones that everyone is yoloing split off at around 3pm to go higher and the ones that didn’t went lower.

Long $MOS / The Mosaic Company
TL;DR: The Mosaic Company is a   phosphate fertilizer producer, and has tailwinds of (1) rising food prices and (2) favorable regulatory and monopol-y-ish market conditions. I think it could double over the next six months, and am in $35 LEAPs. Earnings are after market Wednesday Feb 17th.  The  , the   is protecting its own.  Food price inflation may still largely be unnoticeable in the grocery store, but there are signs elsewhere.

However, this is meant to be a 6-9 month play at a minimum, not necessarily an earnings bet.

$TLRY and $APHA Merger Arbitrage
Currently Tilray and Aphria are being mispriced by the market assuming a deal goes through. I see the deal as very likely to happen. The conversion rate for Aphria shares into Tilray shares is   which means for every Aphria share you own you get .8381 shares of Tilray. Right now, Tilray is trading around $63 per share. This means that theoretically Aphria should be worth around $52 at the close of the deal. Currently Aphria is trading at a 50% discount. Is the market assuming the deal won’t go through? Is Tilray only going up because of a short squeeze? Seems like a good opportunity for a pair trade at this crazy discount.  The deal is expected to close around March/April  Edit: You can view the current ratio here:
$TRXC (TransEnterix): already over 1B market cap (DD)
Dear tards and ladymen,    DOES EVERY SINGLE POST HAVE TO BE A SHITPOST ABOUT APES BAGHOLDING FUCKING $GME AND OTHER NEWFAG STUFF TO GET ANY ATTENTION?      YES, THE MARKET CAP IS OVER 1B, STOP CHECKING RETARDED WEBSITES AND, IN DOUBT, CALCULATE IT YOURSELVES        TL;DR:      The rocket is taking off. Company good, system good, money not much. Competitor much money. Company promising. Shares cheap cheap, tendies lots. Shares is the play.    today I want to bring $TRXC to your attention. I know you already know this stock, but bear with me. It has just crossed 1B market cap in a pretty awesome rally that started only a couple days ago, and it has grown over +46% today at the time of writing this DD.  But... who are $TRXC, you may ask?  TransEnterix build the devices... no, fuck this, the BATTLESTATIONS for surgeons to operate with the minimally invasive procedure known as laparoscopy ( . Their system is called SENHANCE. Essentially, a robotic device pokes some holes in your tummy and, without opening you up for good, some little arms with tools, cameras, light... are introduced in your poor unfit office body to fix whatever is broken. Afterwards, the holes are stitched together and you can recover quickly and with fewer marks.  OK, OK, you may say, "why should this shit interest me? Does this not exist already? How do they do it?". I am glad you ask! This does exist, yes, and the industry standard is the well-known Da Vinci surgical system ( . So what the fuck is interesting about $TRXC? A couple things:  \- Senhance is a more modern system, with haptic feedback and even fucking eye tracking for camera control. SAUCES:        The concept is that the surgeon and the machine FUSE INTO ONE, becoming, you know, a Robocop or something like that.  \- TransEnterix bets for AI-POWERED MACHINE VISION to, for example, make the system's camera automatically follow the tools being used and this beast already has THE CE SIGN FOR COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE AND FDA CLEARANCE. SAUCES:           \- Insiders have started moving and buying more stock just two days ago (on Monday):        \- They have started training surgeons in Japan to conquer their market:     \- And know the boring fundamentals:  Market Cap   (at the moment of typing this)  Public float    Shares outstanding 176M  You can forget about P/E but LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ITS COMPETITOR, $ISRG:  Market cap    Public float    Shares outstanding:    So while the shares outstanding and the float are admittedly larger for $TRXC, they are still extremely undervalued if they are to be compared with their competitor which is trading, at the moment, at $788 per share. Of course, of course, it's a small company and establishing new surgical standards is complicated but, to me, they look like a steal EVEN AT THE CURRENT PRICE. And... wanna see how much they were in the past?     I might have forgotten something or might have gotten something wrong because, needless to say,    I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I AM A BIT RETARDED BUT I JUST LIKE THIS STOCK.      TL;DR:      The rocket is taking off. Company good, system good, money not much. Competitor much money. Company promising. Shares cheap cheap, tendies lots. Shares is the play.      Positions:    Doggystyle  Reverse cowgirl    (yes, .05 lol) shares @ $   May the tendieman bless your wife's boyfriend(s).  EDIT: Mods keep removing this saying the market cap is below 1B.   It's not.      EDIT2: AAAND they bet for remote operations aka TELESURGERY:     And this is what such a system looks like, for the jackasses saying "LoL YoU CalLeD ThAt A BAttLeStatIon"     EDIT3: I don't have time to write too much about it right now (this already ate up my fun time today), but their management is also pretty good:     Might write something on them in the following days.  EDIT4: I did find more fun time. Some doctors in Germany wrote a paper on Senhance, testing its feasibility, and compared it to Da Vinci:     The comparison with Da Vinci points out the reduced cost of using Senhance:  >\[..\] the ability to utilize conventional laparoscopic 5- and 10-mm trocars stands out in comparison to the da Vinci® robotic system which incorporates its own 8- and 12-mm ports \[ \]. Since fully reusable instruments are used by this surgical robotic system, an advantage regarding cost efficacy is expected when compared to the da Vinci® system. Excluding the acquisition costs of the Senhance™ Surgical Robotic System, the robot-specific cost per case at our department was 800 Euros, covering the expenses for drapes, instruments and maintenance according to a flat rate-based service contract. This comes in contrast to costs as high as 1700 Euros for drapes and instruments with da Vinci® robotic system while excluding maintenance and acquisition costs.  TL; DR: excluding maintenance and acquisition costs, each operation using Da Vinci ($ISRG) costs more than DOUBLE what it costs using Senhance ($TRXC).  And another paper:     This paper is not accessible for free, so let me just copy the conclusions for you autists to salivate:  >Our experience with diferent types of robotic surgeries allows us to state that the Senhance® robotic system is feasible and safe for general surgery, gynecology, and urology, and a wider implementation of this system worldwide is simply   a question of time  .  EDIT5: VIRTUAL INVESTOR DAY ON FEB 23.    EDIT6: Article from investorplace    >With $90 million in the bank, TransEnterix can last at least eight quarters at this rate. However, the truth is the company is likely to continue to raise capital, especially as its stock price rises. Therefore I don’t think that TransEnterix will run out of cash to fund its operations.  EDIT7: To complete this DD a little bit: "Camisa, why do you only say good things about this company? Why are they so cheap and how come their value has changed so dramatically over time?". OF COURSE there are downsides to the company. For example, how do you explain that they have been around so long and only have systems in 11 hospitals? Well, that's the thing: they haven't sold so many thus far. But this is also the reason why they have been forced to add functionality to become competitive. Whether this is the one time they succeed for good, I do not know - I only have two balls and neither of them is made of crystal. They seem to be turning things around though and I am jacked to the tits.
I understand diamond handing, but opportunity losses are real
I lost a third of my portfolio in GME BB and AMC. I would be down -93% if I still held. I sold for a -33% portfolio loss when they halted trading and have sense made everything back just from quick picks i’ve seen on here and other subreddits. I do get holding guys, but if it’s bleeding you dry it may be better to switch into something with a positive net return. I know i’ll be called melvin, or a shill.. but if you read my post history you’ll see I was gung-ho with you guys until they showed that it doesn’t matter because they own the market. Just my thoughts on it, I do hope you all get your money back one way or another. God speed soldiers.
There's a case for GME short-term, but please stop making things up
Position: 30 GME @ 179 avg cost basis, still holding because it's not a loss until you sell. Obligatory                   I've been a longtime lurker on this sub since it was <1m degenerates, finally clicked the join button around Dec/Jan. It's great to see many new redditors take an interest in WSB, but for the love of Elon Musk,   READ THE POSTING GUIDELINES AND STOP MAKING THINGS UP!!!    There is a case for GME, given the new CEO/CTO, console cycle, and massive short interest/short position (even at the real 42-43% SI and 21m SP). Those are factual events and numbers. What isn't the case are bagholders who have less of an understanding of the stock market than u/1r0nyman. It's one thing to hype up GME as a resurgent mecca in retail. It's another thing to   not understand how certain metrics are calculated, when/how data is reported, and blatantly make up numbers   because it fits a delusional reality where GME is going to be $10000/share. I'm not saying GME isn't ripe for another squeeze, but be reasonable. Think about what certain share prices mean and the odds it could ever reach such a height.  # Let me put it into context:      GME Price Market Cap Comparable    :- :- :-   $1000   BP, Twilio, Anthem   $10000 697B Alibaba, Visa + MC, JP Morgan + Wells Fargo    $69420 4,789,980,000,000 25% US Annual GDP, Apple + Microsoft + Amazon   When you dispute data from Bloomberg Terminal, the holy grail of Wall Street trading, you've lost the investing game.

The Real Deep Fucking Value – KT Corporation
Apparently we’re all saying this now, but I am not a financial advisor and you should do your own DD.  With that being said, I present you with the following:   I’m a fan of DFV the man, but I’m more interested in really   really   deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you’ll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).     For those of you kids who can’t read good, I’ll put the   TLDR   right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it’s almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don’t mean by a little bit… I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $     A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$     I’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $   What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $   This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it’s trading at $  as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only    Value investors typically look for stocks trading at <  price/TBV.  Deep value would be <   KT is trading at  , and a price/book ratio of  !     Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will – hell, sell it short if you want – but I like shares and calls.     KT CORPORATE PROFILE    KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA & Poland.  KT is South Korea’s first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:     Line of Business       % of Korean Market Share     --: Mobile Services     Fixed-line local telephone & VoIP     Broadband Internet Access     Pay TV Services       As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.    Products & Services       % of Total Revenue     --: Mobile Services (incl. 5G)     Fixed-line (incl. VoIP, broadband, data comm.)     Media & Content     Financial Services (incl. credit card solutions)     Other (incl. IT, network services, real estate development)     Sale of goods (primarily mobile handsets)       Corporate Location Map:      KT has ~30% institutional ownership, with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020.  KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it’s worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly    No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.       FINANCIAL METRICS & PEER COMPARISONS    KT’s balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.     Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:      Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $  - $  (unrealistic top end):      Compared to industry peers/comps:      The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again,   it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.    You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real   deep fucking value.        Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%.       They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:      I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.  Everyone looks for the   TLDR   at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:  Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets. This is REAL value.
$ACB DD
I was in ACB like over a year ago and lost a lot of money on it,  but this time is different.  Why?  because we got big money behind it,  the momentum, and so many states have and will continue to legalize.  ACB is poised to sell a lot of product and already owns many farms, while other companies like gay ass tilray do to but I think it is overvalued.  Tilray is big gay and only $BB gang would buy that shit lol.     This used to be a sub full of opinions, you could tell people that you think they've drunk away what  little brain cells they had left when they post stupid DD that isn't  even DD. Now it's like an endless circle jerk over how. I don't  give a shit about your cause, I just want to make tendies and that's  what this sub used to be all about.      TLDR:  ACB is poised to sell a lot of product and already owns many farms, while other companies like gay ass tilray do tOo but I think it is overvalued.  TLDR2:I was in ACB like over a year ago and lost a lot of money on it,  but this time is different.  Why?  because we got big money behind it,  the momentum, and so many states have and will continue to legalize.

Expecting My PLTR Lockup to End on Feb 18th
I've seen lots of incorrect information posted on when the PLTR lockup expires, so I'd like to share that I expect that my currently locked shares will be cleaned/unrestricted at market open on 2/18. Directly from a Palantir press release:  > \[the lockup\] is expected to continue until the     start of the third trading day     following the date of public disclosure of Palantir’s financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020   Assuming that  the disclosure of Palantir’s 2020 financial results happens as scheduled at 8AM ET on the 16th, here's my understanding of the trading days following the disclosure:      Feb 16th is the first trading day   following the disclosure of Palantir’s 2020 financial results      Feb 17th is the second trading day   following the disclosure of Palantir’s 2020 financial results      Feb 18th is the third trading day   following the disclosure of Palantir’s 2020 financial results, and I'm unlocked at market open.  \-a lab diamond handing ex-Palantir employee

WKHS USPS contract
BLUF: I am long WKHS and believe American-made EV should be the new USPS mail truck. Long time commenter, first time DD’er; and I am not sorry about my lack of emoji inclusion in this DD. This is for pure autistinal personnel.  This is my take on a lot of DD going around WKHS. This is NOT an explanation of a possible short squeeze or how we will ‘stick to the HFs’. Fuck that I’m just trying to pass along my ideas and share them with y’all to get rich; if you like them great! If you don’t, great, but also fuck. This is also not technical analysis. I can make another post with my cup and handle patterns and bull flags showing up everyday indicating bullish trends but I really believe that you cannot use TA to predict the USPS. Sources for technicals are at the bottom.  WKHS price in the short term is almost entirely dependent on the USPS contract. They (the USPS) have been pushing back and pushing back the deadline to make the announcement on who gets USPS’s $6bb contract and hopefully we are approaching the finish line based off a board of governor’s meeting that occurred this week. Publicly there is no break-out candidate but WKHS is one of three, but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the USPS fleet (~165,000 vehicles). The other finalist, Oshkosh, is teaming up with Ford, but their submission is still an ICE which does NOT meet the request and intent of the president’s Zero-Emission initiative. Let’s pause and talk about Biden and the USPS for a second and I’ll put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately:     -Biden wants to electrify the entire US government fleet     -Biden wants to the fleet to be 100% AMERICAN made vehicles     -F is not 100% american made (something like only 64%, and even less for their future EV)     -OSK/F’s submission is an ICE (they are planning EV but it was not their submission to the USPS contract bid)     -WKHS is 100% manufactured in the USA     -WKHS specializes in EV delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players     -WKHS has patents and improvements to ‘last-mile’ delivery  But even with all that info, some may still push for an OSK/F vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government. Let’s talk about that: OSK has a relationship with the military to make Humvee’s and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes. But this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the USPS decision. The USPS is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government. Who is in charge of that branch? Exactly. (That is why Trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the USPS and vote-by-mail, but not the time for this discussion). The USPS is also a for-profit agency AND RECEIVES NO DIRECT TAXPAYER FUNDING, but continues to operate at a loss. The USPS spent $  maintaining their fleet of shitty ICE clunkers in FY2019.  Short of Elon Musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the ISS via First Class Mail, what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely EV. The USPS MUST reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive:     -ICE repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$      -EV repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$      -Total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using EV: ~$4600  The USPS is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a Postmaster General. They operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses. It is imperative for the USPS to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery. Which brings us to another point: Last Mile Delivery.  Last Mile Delivery accounts for more than 53% of total shipping cost. Last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep (literally where USPS operates). It costs $  to deliver a package to your door, but USPS is charging $  So they are already operating a loss. Why is this so expensive? 1) Lower average speed + more time on the road = fewer mpg 2) More stops leads to more idling and more downtime 3) My neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up “to get exercise” = way more time for delivery   The first two of these issues are solved with WKHS. WKHS EV will reduce mpg cost (duh) but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain. Seriously, look up the Workhorse Horsefly. The third issue I will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape.  With all this being said it’s obvious that I feel that WKHS is the obvious choice, but who knows what the board of governors is thinking. Below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard:  Scenario One: 40% chance: WKHS earns the entire contract. Someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars WKHS would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced.  Scenario Two: 30% change: The contract is split up between Oskosh and WorkHorse. In the initial documentation before Biden's 100% green energy plans, the USPS wanted 75% electric 25% gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75% and Oskosh gets 25%. Others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time. Even with only 10% of the contract awarded to WKHS you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day.  Scenario Three: 20% chance: They can’t come to a decision and push it back until next quarter. This has happened already two times. They were first supposed to decide this summer, but they pushed it back to December. In December they failed again and pushed it back to latest March 31st. If this happens, the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement.  Scenario Four: 10% chance: OSK wins the contract. Oskosh is an awesome company, they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us Humvees for the military. They are respected and reliable, however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law can't just resubmit something else at the last minute. Especially with Biden wanting to look like he can get shit done AND after having made a statement about electrifying the US Fleet it looks insanely unlikely that OSK gets the entire bid, but if this happens, the only support that won't get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level.  TLDR: WKHS should win the USPS contract and their short term viability relies on it.  My positions: 600 shares at $34 cost basis, $32C LEAPs 1/2022, $32C’s at 2/12, 2/19, 3/19 Total position is worth around 30,000 right now and about 40% of my single-registered.

Fidelity Investments Sold Its Entire Stake in GameStop. Time to realize it’s not WSB vs Wall St and move on with your life
EDIT: for the idiots who cannot read and think Fidelity sold its position on December 31st, here is GAMESTOPS ownership report on Dec 31:     Fidelity owned   million shares as of dec 31. As of Jan 29, that number is 87. They unloaded their stake in January, stop downvoting everything that doesn’t conform to your hivemind.  Edit 2: Fidelity Investments = \ = Fidelity Mutual Funds, and as such they have different investment strategies. But I see that has escaped the galaxy brains on this post.    Edit 3: People really coming thru and downvoting comments unrelated to gme because I posted a negative article about their messiah   Edit 4: posting a link to an SEC file WHICH YOU CLEARLY DID NOT READ does not prove Fidelity did not sell. If you did a little actual thinking, you could go to the sec website and see that they in fact sell. Also the file you posted was not related to an internal transfer like you think.   ORIGINAL POST:  During January, Fidelity Investments sold its entire stake in GameStop, amounting to   million shares or 13% of the company, for massive gains. As of January 29, they now own 87 shares. Last I checked, Fidelity is no more a friend to you or me than Melvin Capital.   It’s time to realize that this wasn’t wsb vs Wall st and move on with your lives. There was a massive short squeeze, with big money on either raise, and smart money cashed out at the top. Anyone who still has the stock isn’t ‘holding the line’, just the bag.   This sub turned into a cult. I want to see big plays and big ‘Guhs’, not a million posts about holding the line on a company that hasn’t turned a profit since 2018. This GME shit has ruined this sub, and I honestly think all these new users are going to be prime for pump and dump scams on random shit stocks, which really worries me in terms of this sub actually surviving.   If you invested at the top in GME, I am sorry foe you and sorry that you got caught up in the mania. But some free advice: the second you get emotional about investing, you’ve lost. If you invest more money than you can afford to lose, you’re not going to be able to think rationally or objectively about your investment, and will Inevitably get plowed. Ditto for this fake crusade against Wall Street (which I’m convinced is cover for people to dump their shares on unsuspecting idiots).

Fidelity Dropped GME Stock from   to 87 Shares on 28 Jan...
So all those calculations about institutional ownership were moot...standing by for downvotes from   hands...     Fidelity Cashes In Most of GameStop Stake    2/10/21, 1:07 PM Fidelity Investments sold nearly all of its positions in GameStop Corp. last month, just as shares of the videogame retailer were surging.  Fidelity's GameStop stake dropped to 87 shares on Jan. 29 from   million shares, or 13% of the company, on Dec. 31, according to securities filings. The sales ended Fidelity's run as the volatile stock's largest shareholder.  I’m assuming this was on the 28th of Jan when RH ceased allowing buys. This would seem to be coordinate in a since that RH blocks the retail buyers and Fidelity pushes the shorts to cover at the lower...  TLDR: Uhh yeah...  Edit: Here is the NASDAQ holdings of GME as of 12/31    FMR LLC	12/31/2020	9,276,087	-258,003	 	$466,680  Here is the fidelity fund that held...     Currently has 28B under AUM. The GME position if it still had it should be in the Top Ten based on the holdings from the SEC   At the height it would be   x $  approx 1B based on the average share between open and close...

Weed stocks brrr
Pissed off and tired of being poor. Was up $1500 on BB a few weeks ago before buying was restricted. down even more since then. Just put the rest of my bank account in the weed stocks.

When weed stocks are rippin'
$UBS ready to rip
$UBS   3/19 relatively low float stock with cheap premiums and lots of call option volume.   Here is some DD I’ve collected    UBS joint venture deal:        UBS looks to double workforce:        the big one:      Aside from these great pieces of news, UBS   increased greatly. Premiums are still the same price though. Meaning it’s not to late to hop on the train.   With a relatively low float stock like this. This can go flying if buy volume increases.  I personally have   for 3/19 because It’s the best value at only $  and I like this stock       If you guys are with the movement feel free to post about it and upvote to spread the word   EDIT: This is not financial advice nor a pump, this is strictly theoretical and otherwise just a good company with some great news coming out.
Why are we not investing in the Airline industry or rental property sites like AirBNB?
I just thought that it would make sense to invest in some airline companies such as American, Delta, and Southwest as the brink of the pandemic and restriction of air travel has brought them down to a mere nothingness in price. This will most definitely take 2-3 years to see a major return on investment, which I don't know if you retards can last 5 minutes  without checking the stock, let alone the idiot day-traders on here.  AirBNB was released on the market in December and has gone up +200%, again this will go up significantly once the notion of dangerous air travel, international passage restrictions, and shift to normal life returns.

Thoughts on Feb. 18th congressional hearing with Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel?
Will the US government step up and do what’s right by protecting the people or will they side with Wall Street?  I find it interesting that Melvin and Citadel are now included. There must be some evidence linking the three companies for congress to warrant the hearing?     Robinhood, Melvin Capital, Citadel execs expected to testify in Congress on GameStop turmoil -sources
You only have to have a single brain cell to be here and apparently that's too much to ask.
I cant stress enough the opportunities being LOST for real people, millions of people ON THIS SUB because a few bored cunts want to make this GME shit into something it's not. Even worse is that the real answer to the thing they claim to want is staring them right in the face. I'll explain       Fuck your shitdeology. Almost every post on GME is barely concealed garbage class warfare shit and is complete denialism almost entirely without any self awareness or actual real evidence. Or trash memes. (KINDA LIKE MOST OF THE STUFF ON THE REST OF REDDIT) What a shock!   Save WSB please its been completely trashed for a month now. I remember when we would've been seeing dozens of posts about all the ERs going on. Instead its this garbage ideology shit masked as GME love. I made 100k off GME. Great. but if you think it was ever truly about beating hedgefunds you're seriously retarded. I only cared about hedgefunds involved because of the effect it had on the price and the early gamma squeeze that got it moving so rapidly.   We've got 7 million people who don't know a goddamn thing about economics or finance and only care about those subjects now because they've tricked each other by Circle jerking about how this GME shit is somehow a revolution.   If you care about that shit. (Which I dont) Then NO, GME isnt a revolution you fucking retards GME was just a single example about how decentralized access to the mechanisms of finance can create a new model for opportunity to ANYBODY regardless of origin that can elevate millions of peoples in this world's level of financial security and freedom.   And that CAN happen. It can happen if.... if... IF you retards would stop being so self absorbed and in denial about GME and instead learn about the economics, the fundamentals, the financial institutions, instruments etc of how this shit works you could have your actual "revolution" your actual elevation of millions of people accessing "rapid" (but uneven) financial growth.   Instead you just chant memes and pretend you're part of a cause by posting crap about HODL or whatever. You want to be long on GME? Hope the price falls to 20 or lower before earnings and YOLO that shit. (I will) But stop using blatant denialism to ruin a sub and financially ruin yourselves because you're literally just giving money to the hedgefunds that you claim to hate. If you care about poor people getting rich it doesnt require them beating "the rich". Melvin shitron shitadel, they're all just a massive drop in the bucket and killing them is just for your young egos it's not even a single bloodstain on the tapestry of wealth inequality or whatever shit you're worried about. Poor people getting rich ISNT reliant on rich people getting poor. Figure that out and you might actually go learn something and start making money.    THIS ISNT A WAR.  THIS ISNT OCCUPY 2 OR MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THAT SHIT WAS ALSO LEADERLESS, HOPELESSLY AMBIGUOUS, AND BEYOND POINTLESS.   Go make your own sub if you are actually so unbelievably cancer that you want to continuously post about the exact same fucking thing continuously and forever AND lose money the whole time. If you think that's "a cause" then good luck have fun on the new sub and get lost cause you dont fucking have the half a brain cell required to be in this sub. It only takes one and somehow you dont have it.
PLTR is gonna destroy earnings this Tuesday, hop on the rocket by Friday cuz Monday’s a holiday
Air Canada Q4 report out on Feb 12, buy now or wait?
Air Canada's stock took a huge hit last year for obvious reasons, Q4 earnings report is likely going to show heavy losses, but as things return to normal for 2022 we could see a rally. Are you going to buy now or wait until the earnings report hoping for a dip in the stock price?
Thoughts on GE?
Was trying to look around here for any recent DD on GE to throw into consideration. From what I’ve gathered this far, they’re making some great changes internally and it’s improved their financials. Looks pretty nice as a buy for where it’s at now but then there’s also the fact that if I look out to a 5 year chart, they’ve been descending into the toilet since long before covid and this could just be a “beginning of post covid era” jump back to where it was before March... after which it’ll continue slowly creeping towards the shitter again. Thoughts?  Edit: Please stop spamming GME. No I did not miss an “M”. This is why everyone’s done with you guys, you have your own sub threads... please stay there.
Candles got me like
Why are cannabis stocks all trading in the EXACT same pattern today?
I tried to create a post with a screenshot of the graph but the automods didn't like that I used imgur.  Tried to create a post uploading the image directly to reddit and the post got ninja deleted.    What in the fuck.... this sub only for shit posting now?  Here:       - This shows the buy/sell trend for some of the major cannabis companies.  Look at 10:30AM.   The trend lines all follow the EXACT same pattern. Anyone know why this is?
Why Rite Aid is RAD not BAD (anymore)
Welcome back to another Rite aid (RAD) shitpost.  I’m back as my prediction has been correct so far, and I only expect this trend to continue. Up 300% so far.  It is still incredibly EARLY for reasons I will explain.        RITE AID (RAD)    Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you’re saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It’s okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20   reverse stock split   artificially X 20 the price.    WHAT DOES THIS MEAN    It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.    In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.    In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of   billion.  Yet if we look here    Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.     They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.     MORE PROMISING NUMBERS       Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)  Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.    Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.       WHAT DO I DO    I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.    I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April.   Tl;dr: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it’s STILL fundamentally undervalued.  Read last paragraph for plays.    My earlier posts were earlier warnings but I’m yoloing today I think it’ll start to run up again as vaccine distribution   up.
Could Psychedelics (PSYK) be the next weed?
Marijuana made so much money for those who got in very early. It was originally presented as a medical product, but when regions started to legalize it, it blew up.  Now there's a new ETF dealing in psychedelics (PSYK) that deals in a handful of companies focused on research for the application of psychedelics to treat mental health and other medical issues.  As mental health becomes an increasingly important part of medical research, and as countries around the world continue to lower regulation around the use of various 'narcotics' could this stock have the potential of blowing up?  I am thinking of investing, I just wanted to see what others think?
Why APHA is an Alpha Trade in the Short and Long-run (Actual DD)
Tl;dr: I'm willing to bet all of you degenerates smoke weed and drive to your wife's boyfriend's house every Saturday night. Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).       Reason 1:   Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.  Remember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague   happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.  This is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.  There will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.    Reason 2:   APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.     Instead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased   in 2017,   in 2018,       in 2019, and   in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.  Even though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has   billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are "unusual expenses," implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases.     Reason 3:   Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.  Yup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a "tough on crime" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so),   weed will be effectively legal   over time even if it's not truly legal.  Position: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.
I mean, look at these hands!
Why CGC is the best choice for you if you want to join Weed Gang
Listen, retards, I can try to look smart, copy-paste dozens of articles you won't even click, but I won't, because I'm as retarded as you're and I can't read. I know that lots of you were spending money on weed long before the Weed Gang movement has started but it's time when you can buy some weed and get some tendies for it. Sounds cool isn't it? But many of you, esplecially the ones who got burned on GME, don't know which stock to gamble right now because many of them are already 100-200% up. My best advice for you right now is to go balls deep in Canopy Growth Corp (CGC). It's only 10% up since last week and still wasn't affected by WSB autists.   and their business looks very good and as soon as the legalization thing gets covered, CGC will skyrocket even without this hype so it's an actual long-term investment. And since everyone is buying weed stocks it's a much more attractive pick for you right now.    Sorry for spelling. Obligatory some rockets     and some trees for you, potheads 🌳🌳🌳     It's not financial advice, I just like everything green. See you on the next shareholder meeting
Even the smallest shareholder can change the course of the future - PART 2
Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery
Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. And so far they are killing it!  There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.  Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner’s third location in SoCal (joining  , dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon.  “Amazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,” R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. “In our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,” Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe’s due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.  “H-E-B and Trader Joe’s are terrific brands, yet Amazon’s unmatched convenience is addictive,” wrote Ms. Goller. “The dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals’ stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon’s hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.”  During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, "We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020." Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.  During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was “off to a good start,” adding there was “a lot of interest” in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores.  Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI).

Yo Qestion madlads about SNDL
RobbingHood forced my GME and AMC closed at a loss, not huge but I didn’t have a lot of skin in the game. So I swapped to fidelity which from what I can find is a more reputable. My account is locked down at this point so I can’t buy or sell anything yet, and I’m taking this time to get brained up on this shit.  I’ve seen SNDL over the past 5 or so trade days go up from .7 to  , and I’m trying to figure out why it’s happening to see if there is still a good bet or if I would be the greater fool. Is there maths on this boi’s? Or like a reasonable explanation?  Also when my account opens for testing you will see a poor mans yolo.
Virgin Galactic $SPCE
Dear /Wallstreetbets     Today I want to talk about Virgin Galactic and the potential the company has. Space travel is vastly developing and together with the EV business this will be the future.    Chamath   helped Virgin Galactic in the process to go public. Recently Cathie announced that she will create   a Space ETF  . ARKQ has been buying a lot of shares over the last few months. Recently ARKQ sold some shares, but I would consider it normal since the stock is up by 140% since September. I would assume ARKQ took some profits and reinvested them in other companies.  I would like to take a look at the business model of the company. Many "Bears" are saying that the business won't be profitable because of the high cost of the tickets. Estimates are that the price for one ticket will be around   dollars. So their customers would have to be millionaires in order to be able to pay for it. Only 1% of the population is a millionaire. So you would assume it won't be very profitable in the long run.  But let's take a look at the history of flying. In it's early years, flying was very expensive and only a luxury for the rich. Back in 1941, the cost to travel from Boston to Los Angeles was   $   . In 2015 this only costs   $   . Source:    Space travel might have a similar trend regarding the price of the tickets. Only the rich will be able to afford a ticket to space in the beginning but as technology improves, the business costs will be reduced.  But space travel is not their only catalyst. They are looking into supersonic flights. They made a deal with   Rolls-Royce   regarding this subject. Here's an article for those who are interested:    I want to talk about the short interest.   The short percent of float is currently    ! In November the short percent reached its peak at   Since then some shorts have been covering their positions as many catalysts are being released. But with a successful flight to space, the stock price might surge and more shorts might give up on their position. I just want to point you out, the stock price in November was $  Currently the stock trades at $  To be honest, they might be sweating right now. Source:    Okay I will finish this DD with a list of   catalysts   which are coming:  \- This   Saturday   Virgin galactic will open the   flight window  . This does not mean they will fly the Saturday, but it will happen within the next few days. There was an unsuccessful flight back in December. But what some people might not understand, is the amount of safety procedures a company has to take. SpaceX for example are shooting up many rockets each year, but there are no passengers. So when a rocket explodes, many people would be fascinated by the explosion. But imagine if a rocket with 3 people exploded. That's why it is so much harder for Virgin Galactic to have a successful flight.  I live in Belgium and I was watching the news here. Back in December the news reported about the failed flight of Virgin Galactic. I didn't expect this at all. But imagine if they have a successful flight. The news would spread around the world.  \- After the successful flight, Richard Branson will go to space later this year. It was scheduled in Q1-Q2 of 2021, but it got pushed back due to the failed test in december.  \- They are expecting to have their first commercial space flight in 2021.  \- Cathie will launch her Space ETF.  I think this stock has a lot of potential and a successful flight will launch this stock. Virgin Galactic will literally bring us closer to the moon. I hope you enjoyed my DD and if i missed something, please let me know in the comments.

$AUY is a Gold Mine (Both Figuratively and Literally)
Hello Fellow Retards,  I come to you with news from a boomers favorite form of currency: gold. More specifically, a mining company, Yamana Gold. They have earnings tomorrow on the 11th, and based on their previous guidance, they are going to post very strong earnings. Although I hold shares (yeah yeah I know), options are dirt cheap with such low IV. I want to present a case for the company as I believe they have a great year ahead of them.  Now I know gold is down in the past few months, but it still remains as strong as its ever been, and Yamana Gold (ticker $AUY) has been absolutely benefiting from the high prices. With the Feds keeping lending rates low through 2023 and supporting this vision with monthly Treasury bond purchases, this can push down long-term yields. Add this onto the ongoing fiscal stimulus and a steadily increasing money supply, there are many reasons for investors to choose gold in the coming years.  On top of high gold/silver prices, Yamana is looking at a nice increase in production from their Canadian Malartic mine in 2021, and is expected to benefit from higher output at the newer Cerro Moro mine. Yamana is pushing to deeper underground levels at Cerro Moro, which will lead to improved yield and production potential. Yamana's management expects to   in each of the next three years.   With gold prices up significantly over the past five years, Yamana has also been able to   by over $1 billion, and increase their annual dividend 425% over 18 months. In a few more quarters at this 1 million GEO annual target, and it just might become net-cash positive.  Positions: 200 shares @ $  and 2/19 $5C.
DD: Cinemark ($CNK) – Clear Standout in “Moon Stock” Screen
First time poster, longtime tard. GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your “HF shill” comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (…can’t be sure with half you guys…)  The perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it’s so obvious it hurts. AMC’s ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.  This is a rare one-two punch where both the technical & fundamental pictures look great.    Punchline Upfront:   CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $    # Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)  OK… Why CNK? Simple: I ran a “Moon Screen” which looked for:   1.   High Short Interest   (>20% of floatable shares outstanding) 2.   Cheap Stock   (Hasn’t Had A “GME moment”, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.) 3.   Small company   with lower trading volume (both mean more upside) 4.   Liquid   (  a lot)   call options   (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (  maximize tendies)   and CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, it’s because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. That’s right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it’s similarity to GME pre-orbit.   # Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)  COVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNK’s theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.     # Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World    TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)  Cinemark’s theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Don’t take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): “\[CNK\] tends to be more suburban, while \[AMC’s\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro.”   This is what gets me excited.   While we still don’t fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:  1. Suburban locations have lower rent 2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs  Just think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be “the only game in town” in suburbia  In addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemark’s customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:  1. More price sensitive customers => less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home => more likely to continue going to the theater  # Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet => Longer Runway to Weather “COVID Storm”    TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID  Strong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at     Industry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins;   “fatter” (  good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)  Low rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.  # Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness  25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think)        Valuation/\ Nerd Shit\ :      Has traded historically at   fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at   as recently as a few years ago    Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.   EBITDA was \~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at 700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first “normal” year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple,  , gives me a price of $  (after dividing by shares outstanding)    Target Price: $          Afterthought – Takeout Upside:      Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?   Just as restaurants won’t go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second   As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand   A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services       Notes/Links:      Sean Gamble   \-  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer   >"And in terms of our overlap, it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance. In general, it's pretty small, I would say, estimate less than 20%. You just consider our market shares, that can kind of show that it's only a small portion in.   We generally tend to be more suburban, while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro  . So it's a limited overlap."  CNK Breaks Higher After 20:       Takeover Makes Sense Links:

For my Palantirians and Palantards
PS: The post is meant to explain why we're down for the day (original purpose) and provide assurance for the poor newbs who don't know any better. Not calling for a DD. I say buy in for the short term (Calls) to capitalize on the uptrend to ER, then get out, and determine what you want to do next by the Lockup     The drop hurts, I know. But understand that this dip is in reality, another buying opportunity that was initiated by a few things.  Firstly the most obvious one, the NASDAQ. It's plunging right now; down,   atm although it's slowly recuperating it's #'s; good job Sleepy Joe. Since the WSB hype left us during the initial blitz, we now follow the MKT beat for beat. So yeah, I wonder what would happen.  Secondly, you have to consider why people might consider selling. Although we can scream "to the moon" all day, in the short term, you'd have to acknowledge how much PLTR has jumped since the Thursday scare, even with the price tanking. Before the SOD, it was at $38, nearly a 20% jump up from 5 days ago. And even with the drop, we're in a very strong, Bullish uptrend. On top of that, we've had 5 ascending closes in a row, differed by pretty big figures, it can't keep doing this for forever. So although as a Long, the reasoning is beyond short sighted and retarded for literally a million reasons, you can at least see where they're at in the head.  Plus don't forget, we're still a top tier MM target and you know deep down they're licking their lips for ER. On top of that, don't forget about all the Retail Traders who are doing so also, but haven't cashed in. It's only Wednesday. ER is Pre-MKT Tuesday. That's a whole week to go through. Wdyt think is going to happen when people realize the beast that's soon to come as everyday passes? You believe we'll be below $30 EOW, with the inevitable hype, like those vegetable brained Bears keep preaching?  Hovering around $36 really isn't that bad, it's just back to where we were 2 days ago, that's still huge progress for a week's time. Longs, remain plush. Late bloomers, don't fret. The upward jump will recrudesce once more, back to tranquility lane.  So as we've all said before. Just hold on tight, buy up those dips and enjoy the ride as the blitz has yet to commence. This is just a minor Pullback, a road bump, in a drive up the mountain.
Teva Pharma
Well, If anyone listened to my last post about ACB and bought some OTM FDs you'd be up a cool 500% if you sold this morning, so figured give this another shot.    With 2.1billion in positive cash flow Teva has committed to making these changes by 2030   Specifically, the company has committed by 2030 to:    Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% versus 2017 levels to support efforts to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2°C, aligning with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.   Improve transparency of Scope 3 GHG emissions and increase engagement on climate issues with key suppliers throughout the value chain.   Increase energy efficiency by 10% and the total proportion of energy purchased or generated from renewable sources to 50%.   Reduce total water withdrawal by 10% in areas projected to be in water stress.   Assess and mitigate the environmental impact of pharmaceutical ingredients used in operations.   Reduce the overall mass of secondary and tertiary packaging materials per unit dose and increase the proportion of recycled and responsibly-sourced materials by 10%.   Assess the environmental lifecycle impact of key products.   Continue to minimize waste generated from operations and the environmental impact of its disposal.   Meet existing AMR Industry Alliance commitments to minimize antimicrobial discharges from the supply chain.     That sounds pretty fuckin green, aka one stock to own during the Biden presidency.     Also lets look at some projections for next year   2021 business outlook:    Revenues are expected to be $  - $  billion (2020 actual results include \~$240 million in revenues from generic products in Japan divested on February 1, 2021, along with a manufacturing site)   Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $  - $    Free cash flow is expected to be $  - $  billion  Someone wanna explain to me how a company projected to do 16 Billion plus in revenue still only have a market cap of 12 billion? Simple it's underpriced.   Current position  20 Long calls 9/17/21 $15  I wanted to add more info/ will probably add more thorough dd, currently at work.     TLDR  $TEVA is a good long term play.  Also they're in talks to co-produce a covid vaccine aka $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$     Im not sure if anyone ever kept of with Novavax but they're sitting at a cool $300
Robinhood is making millions off your trailing stop orders (data n stuff)
reposting this as it's more relevant than ever to gtfo of Robinhood.   Robinhood made $90m in Q1 2020 off non-marketable limit orders. More-so than any one   single   entity while being a much smaller company in terms of overall flow.  Which has a very intriguing image near the bottom:    Article:       Here is Robinhood's   on their stock routing and execution quality. In which it says:  >  Is Robinhood incentivized to send orders to one market maker over another?     No. To ensure we have a fair system, we don’t take rebates into consideration when we choose which market maker will execute your orders. Also, all market makers with whom we have relationships pay us rebates at the same rate.  Doesn't seem true but I could be wrong.  As well as their    tldr; your trailing stops don't trigger as fast as you'd like them to because they make a shit load off the bid-ask spread. As well as seemingly getting a sweetheart deal on S&P500 spread. Market liquidity isn't your friend when you're commission free trading.  autist tldr; using trailing stops on robinhood is like tongue punching your sister's fart box.
Stonks Only Go Up 🤝
To all my fellow degenerates, What stock was your all time biggest winner?
I don't know about you guys, but I started trading as a socially acceptable substitute for my crippling gambling addiction. it was supposed to be a temporary thing, but now 3 years later it's how I make a living. I could never really afford to trade with much (700-1200) in my trading account. and for a while I made just enough to get by. that was until I took a look at the investments I had through my bank, I only owned a position in one company. It was 700 shares of TSLA that a bought for $35 each in 2016. An impulsive investment I made with a 25k severance cheque, turned me a profit of   $602,    As much as I wanted to take it to the blackjack table, and put the rest up my nose, I ended up putting half of it into my trading account.       EDIT --    Probably shouldn't care about the people calling cap in the comments.. but nevertheless, here is a screenshot of when I opened the position --
Ford Motors (F) DD
Overview    Ford Motors is currently undervalued ($45B) after an underperforming Q4 but is taking the right steps to compete in the electric and autonomous vehicle markets going forward.    Reasons      Ford is already in an upward trend the past 30 days. This week they just released news of their   $29 Billion   (with a 'B') investment into their electric and autonomous vehicles department  (  surpassing that of General Motors.   Ford now has it's first credible mass-market competition to Tesla in the   which goes on sale later this year.   Ford is bringing the real 'merica to electric trucks (sorry Elon) with it's upcoming   in mid-2022.   Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, looking to IPO this year (    Ford in the running to be Post Office's next delivery vehicle (    The   new Ford Bronco release date   is spring 2021. (    Tesla is in trouble with Chinese regulators and other companies are ready to take up some market share.   Even if you don't buy options and are just a share investor, Ford Motors has a respectable   Dividend Yield.   And if you don't believe me an actual (non-monkey) analyst has already said it would be going up to $14 ( .    Speculation    With Tesla leading the market in electric vehicles, America needs competition to take place. Who better than one of the oldest vehicle manufacturers? Ford knows trucks, which will be a big part of the upcoming electric market. How many times have you heard two bro's start arguing about trucks and inevitably one of them is always a Ford?!? The stock is ripe for the taking and if you want to get some tendies, you should get in now.    TLDR  ; Ford is 'merica. 'Merica needs electric trucks. Go buy Ford.    This is not financial advice. Just some things I thought you would like to know.      Obligatory             🌕    Position(s)   $14 3/19c, $15 3/19c    Edit   Added post office update, added Rivian update, Bronco update
APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage
TLRY and APHA are merging.   1 Share of TLRY is bouncing around 60/share at the moment.   1 Share of APHA is about 28/share  When the merger completes the publicly announced ratio of the new company to the old is that current Tilray stockholders will retain exactly one share, while due to market cap+outstanding shares at the time of the merger, APHA shareholders will retain .83 shares per current share of APHA.  So, if current prices hold there is a HUGE gap here that must close. Either TLRY must come down, or APHA must rise. Based on current value of TLRY, APHA shares have an expected value of    Based on the current value of APHA, TLRY shares have an expected value of    OR, if for some reason the gap stays as large as it is, APHA shareholders will realize a 78% gain at the moment of the merger.  Positions:  APHA 35c Feb 12  APHA Shares  EDIT: Some of you are a little dense.  To be clear, if the results here are  1. TLRY falls to close gap 2. APHA Rises to close gap 3. APHA shareholders realize a large gain in value at time of merger. 4. TLRY RISES more than APHA   The obvious play would be APHA. In all three situations you are either neutral or gaining.  EDIT2: There ARE, of course, other situations in which you get boned here.  For example, the merger could fall through, TLRY could drop like a stone, BOTH could drop, etc.
$APHA calls bought on Sept. 29 last year. Still holding on for 5-digit% return.

Stacey Kronch2 hours ago  Please read. Please read all the way through.  Did a test the other day. Will be contacting the SEC with a copy to TDA. I have a sizable amount of shares in my account. Yet, any options expiration date, and I tried out until June, they will not let me sell covered calls. How does hedge funds do it and they don’t even own the shares? I have copied the reason for trade refusal and it follows in quotes. “     Tax Lot ID Method:Your standing method  Entered:15:20:16 02/09/21 Reuse  Order rejected: Underlying is a hard to borrow stock. We are not accepting this order type at this time.” Why do they have to borrow for me? I own shares long. I am not a naked short like hedge funds. If anyone can explain this travesty please do, because I will be asking the SEC. Also if anyone has Reddit account can you please post this. Thanking all in advance.
The sub is becoming a pyramid scheme and something has to be done.
What the fuck happened? This used to be a sub full of different opinions, you could tell people that you think they've drunk away what little brain cells they had left when they post stupid DD that isn't even DD. Now it's like r/politics , an endless circle jerk over how "The hedge funds will bleed". I don't give a shit about your cause, I just want to make tendies and that's what this sub used to be all about. Now the only content is: GME, GME, Short, "haha Elon twitter go woosh". Low-quality bullshit content barely worthy of r/funny. What happened to the likes of JNUG?  Look, I know the game is rigged, we all fucking know that. But this is deranged and has strayed too far from what this sub used to be all about, those sweet tendies. I might sound like your wife's boyfriend when I tell you this, but we have to stop this pyramid scheme level of group thinking delusion.  DD, good memes and both gain and loss porn are getting smothered in a sea of GME-truthing posts. I think I speak not just for myself but for many other long time members of the sub when i say this:  We need to stop circlejerking over one stock and go back being retarded over many stocks/options/gourd futures etc. Have you even heard of JNUG?  Therefore i propose a ban of all GME content that isn't proper DD or memes.  TL:DR GME 1000C or 1P I don't care, I just want this subreddit back.     Also: Know what JNUG is or ban

Reddit Forums turn to Cannabis Sector as stocks hit new highs
A thread on pfizer
The consensus here and in the market is that all the money to be made on Pfizer has been made. I disagree for a few reasons and am currently pumping money into this stock as much as I can. Before reading this, I want to state as clearly as possible I am not in any way a professional/financial advisor I am a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student the only proper education in this area is from yale open-source courses and from books like stocks for the long runs. I believe Pfizer will bottom out at a worst-case scenario of 32$ if I see 32$ I will yolo my portfolio into 3-month 40$ calls, but what I am hoping for is it does not recover until the next quarterly report in which case I will yolo my portfolio into five day or single day calls. Again, I cannot stress enough I am not a professional please do you own research before following me and also if u see a flaw in my theory please tell me. I also want to state that Pfizer has a market cap of 200 billion we do not have the buying power to in any way pump that I am not trying to generate hype around this, but it is 50% of my portfolio.  1 investing fundamentals.   One of the most important ratios in investing is the price to earnings ratio. This fundamentally indicates if a stock is over or undervalued. In the book stocks for the long run which is high on yales economics reading list the author states that a p/e ratio of 16 or higher is overvalued currently the market average is 27 indicating a stock market crash is coming however Pfizer’s is currently twelve. As a dividend stock which it historically has been it would be undervalued based on pure economic theory. To give some examples of competitors p/e ratio Johnson Johnson=26 AstraZeneca= 26 moderna is not profitable. My point here is that Pfizer has one of the best prices to earnings ratio of any company on the market right now indicating it is undervalued. This also indicates in the event of a market crash Pfizer will be one of the best stocks to be holding.  2 currently in a large dip that Pfizer always recover well from  The Pfizer share price has tanked in the last few weeks as wall street decided that spending 2-3 billion developing  the COVID-19 vaccine to save the world was too much money to spend (typical fucking scum of wall street). As a historically consistent  dividend paying stock Pfizer is a well-liked stock by hedge funds and pensions these funds do not reward bad quarters and pulled out this has caused the price to dip over 10%. In the last few years this happened before in July Pfizer announced that it was planning on changing its business model all these funds pulled out and the share price dropped 8 dollars, from this and the fact that it is fundamentally undervalued I believe it wont drop more than 8 dollars.   3 the vaccine revenue will actually take Pfizer to the moon.   For all these hedge funds focusing on dividend stocks quarterly profit is all they care about Pfizer spent large and didn’t earn extra last quarter Pfizer is expecting at least 15 billion dollars in profit from the vaccine alone, when you add this to their typical earnings that is 65 billion expected earnings a 30% increase on their usual earnings , they will absolutely smash their last quarter performance, all the investing into the vaccine has been done now it is time for them to cash in. on top of this Pfizer has massively cut expenditure by splitting the company into two Pfizer and viatrus (I will address this at the end)  4 AstraZeneca vaccine might not work.  It does not work on the Brazilian or south African strain.   5 professional opinions   Every market pundit I can find is estimating that the share price hits 42 dollars this year, some estimating up to 69(nice) while I don’t always trust sources such as CNN money or market commentators in general what It is to me is a validation of my estimations and research.   6 change in direction to become a growth company.  Last year Pfizer announced they were changing their business model from a revenue to growth company meaning they offloaded essentially all non-patented drugs which provided consistent but low revenue this allows them to focus on developing new highly profitable drugs such as the COVID-19\_\_\_0 vaccine while these have high start-up costs of 2-3 billion Pfizer is worth 200 billion and can easily ride out the volatility of 1/5 investments not working when for example the Pfizer vaccine will net them 15 billion minimum (could be more if AstraZeneca fail) that is not all the investment will makes the miRNA technology means they can make a new vaccine in 2 months if needed, this technology will be ridiculously profitable. Typically, investors buy into companies with a growth business plan at wildly overvalued prices  , tesla p/e is 1700 because the prospect of future growth outweighs the lack of current earnings Pfizer is a company aiming for huge growth who are also one of the most fundamentally undervalued stonks on the market.   Conclusion   Pfizer share price is wildly undervalued the market will not take long to correct this when it bounces back it might rocket to the moon and I am strapped in for that moment but even if it doesn’t it will get a 15% gain; I believe that the dip is turning now . my plan is to do this.   A hold the shares I have buy 3 month calls with 40% of my remaining portfolio.  B if I see 34 dollars put 10% of my remaining portfolio 3-month calls.   C if I see 33 dollars put 30% of my remaining portfolio in 3-month calls.   D if I then see 32 dollars yolo my life’s savings (10 times my portfolio) In 3-month calls.   E if the share price is still below 40 dollars coming up to the next quarterly report, I will yolo in 5-day calls aiming for a 2 dollar gain per share (Pfizer has a huge market cap it will move slowly)  This is my opinion on Pfizer I am not in any way qualified to give financial advice  for honesty I am saying I have a position I Pfizer, but I do not believe it is conceivably possible for us to adjust the share price of a 200b dollar company . Please if I have missed something let me know before I yolo on this am I just retard

$BB DD thread: Why this retard believes the fair market value for $BB is $45. Obligatory
I'm not a financial advisor, just a retard YOLO'ing my savings into long calls, so make your own decisions.  TLDR: Blackberry is the market leader in an industry that McKinsey projects will fucking     to $750BN by 2030. BlackBerry has already grown their annual revenue for 2020 by   from 2019, so stap in your tendies because BB are going to the fucking moon.     Other relevant DD:    Market position analysis -      BB Comprehensive guide -      Amazon/BB partnership in the AV space -      Other BB analysis -     1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future  2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.  Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).  THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst   BB sat at a juicy    ).  This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket        . This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto  u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: "Zombie cars and QNX  QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.  Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.  Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?  SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia   is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.  You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon                                          "  3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down.   BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here     TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month
Cresco Labs ($CRLBF) - Why I like this weed stock
TL:DR at the bottom. Not financial advice.  With weed stocks gaining momentum, I thought I share one which I believe is undervalued vs other key players. Cresco currently operates in 9 US states.  This analysis will focus on what I believe are the three most important factors for cannabis - Revenue, Revenue Growth, Liquidity.     Revenue - Cresco vs 5 key players     - Cresco Labs: 355M Revenue ; Market Cap   - Canopy Growth: 477M Revenue ; Market Cap   - Curaleaf: 472M Revenue ; Market Cap   - Cronos: 37M Revenue ; Market Cap   - Tilray : 201M Revenue ; Market Cap   - Aurora: 273M Revenue ; Market Cap   - Aphria+Tilray: 803M Revenue ; Market Cap 20B  If we look purely at revenue, only Aurora and Aphria/Tilray merger appears to have a similar market pricing to Cresco, with a Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 11 and 13 respectively vs Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 10 for Cresco. The 4 other stocks vary from a ratio of 24 to 133.  This means purely on revenue, Cresco could be considered to be undervalued vs other key weed stocks.     Revenue Growth TTM vs 2019 - Vs 5 key players     - Cresco Labs: 175% Growth - Canopy Growth: 111% Growth - Curaleaf: 114% Growth - Cronos: 54% Growth - Tilray : 20% Growth - Aurora: 10% Growth - Aphria+Tilray: 99% Growth  Cresco has by far the highest revenue growth ratio. And this is just looking at ttm vs 2019 as Cresco have their 2020 fiscal calendar report in April. This means on top of these figures, some of these companies would have had more time to grow revenue vs their fiscal calendar 2019 due to differing fiscal calendars.     Liquidity     Below I'm only looking at current ratio and quick ratio. The higher the ratio, the better.  - Cresco Labs:   /   - Canopy Growth:   /   - Curaleaf:   /   - Cronos:   /   - Tilray :   /   - Aurora:   /   - Aphria+Tilray:   /    Cresco has a lower market cap as it is a possibility it does go bankrupt this year if things turn for the worse. However Cresco has a positive EBITDA in their last earnings report and if it does get an injection of cash/stronger results than expected, there is massive room to grow to reach the same value as other companies in the same category.  One of the things that is holding it back is that you can only trade the stock on OTC markets or the Canadian exchange. If it does enter a major US exchange, I can see it go big.  Just like every other weed stock, this stock has growth plans with new dispensaries in yada yada, will have better productivity due to yada yada, increases cultivation by xxx% in yada yada due to yada yada space, and has a new Chief Commercial Officer who has great experience in CG in companies such as yada, yada yada, and yabbadabbadoo. Do your own research, all weed stocks have something new and exciting like this one.  Trades as $CRLBF or CAD$  I have 120 shares.  TL:DR: Dude weed lmao  Edited to add Aphria+Tilray merger

To everyone complaining about people talking shit about GME
"ThIs SuB lOvEs LoSs pOrN" "sInCe wHeN dOeS tHe SuB cArE" etc...  This sub was never about holding stocks retard. We'll never get the loss porn if you guys fucking "hold till 0" because even as overvalued as the piece of shit that is GME is it might not ever hit 0.   You guys are so fucking annoying. Please shut the fuck up. Stop with the conspiracy theories. I wanna go back to lurking. Stop calling everyone shills and bots. Holy fuck
A solution to the state of the sub
Look, I lurked for ages and I’m a new poster but it seems to me there is a solution to the issue of older WSB members disappointed at the way the sub is now due to GME.   I do sympathize with it, it must be annoying seeing a complete sea change in a sub you enjoyed.  I personally lurked, and kind of ingratiated myself. I don’t post to the sub really, just comments.  The best way to solve this would be for someone to set up a new sub, something like “GMEBETS” whatever and then the influx of only GME posters can migrate there. This allows apes their own enclosure, takes pressure off the mods and allows for discussion of other stocks/plays to flow more freely on here.   Just my opinion and yes I do hold GME.
Tesla insider troll's spot on afflatus on Elon
I wonder how I can contact this guy Hendrick and get him to take some more acid and see if he has another great afflatus.  > "If you want to know the truth: I am a young German guy and I was on Acid  while I did this post in the last month," the Post quoted him as saying. "I had  this afflatus that Elon is going to buy <it>, so I created this  trollpost."     >The user, who told the Post his name was Hendrik, told Reuters that the  information in the New York Post article was correct.

Compass Pathways [$CMPS] - Trusting Peter Thiel With My Psychedelics Bet
Hello fellow degenerate gamblers,  Kimchi here... back with another DD to make you all some tendies. My last posted DD was all about headphones... ended up being a nice 5-bagger  with stocks . I'm here today to tell you about Compass Pathways \[$CMPS\], a company I think will be my next multi-bagger trade.     Psychedelics:     Why psychedelics? Psychedelic (and $CMPS in particular) companies tend to focus on the medical aspect of shroom use, looking to create medications to   treat illnesses that are traditionally underserviced  . Compass, for example, focuses on treatment resistant depression - essentially depression that hasn't been able to be treated by medication, counseling, etc. Depression rates have been rising for years and CMPS and other psychedelic drug makers look to   target those most affected  .     Psychedelics have also been anecdotally shown to help with  . It's a field that's just now starting to gain traction and hopefully those who need help the most will be able to get it as the science develops.     Why Compass?:     So why $CMPS out of the many stonks in the psychedelics universe?   1) Compass Pathways is the only psychedelics company currently listed in the US.    I don't mess with OTC stonks (have been burned too many times) and I don't mess with Canadian listings (who calls their currency the "Loonie?). Don't know why other companies haven't listed in the US yet, but I'm not messing with those companies until they do.   2) Peter Thiel is the largest shareholder and they have a superstar board/advisors.   Everyone here knows and loves Peter Thiel; he owns   of the company. The board members at CMPS include the former R&D head at   Merck  , the former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals at   Johnson & Johnson  , former Executive Director of the   European Medicines Agency   among others. Their scientific advisory board includes doctors from   Stanford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Imperial College  , etc. This is a company stacked with talent.   3) CMPS has received FDA "   " and are currently on phase 2 trials.   Breakthrough designations are typically given when preliminary clinical trials show   significant improvements over existing treatments  . "Breakthrough therapies are supported by the FDA throughout the clinical development programme to ensure as efficient a process as possible."   4) CMPS runs the COMPASS Discovery Center, which is working on finding uses for psychedelics.   The biggest pushback against $CMPS is that they're currently only working on one product, COMP360, for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. However they also run the COMPASS Discovery Center, a collaboration between Compass Pathways and various universities to find new uses for psychedelics.   $CMPS will be the exclusive licensee for all new compounds generated.     5) They're just seem like good people.   Sure this may not be important to company profits in the long term, but this is something that makes me feel a bit warm and fuzzy inside. They recently   to   help the homeless in London  . Maybe I'm stupid, but this helps me trust the company's leaders a bit more.    Target Price:    I'm not a research analyst so I'm not going to break down the numbers in terms of sales of COMP360 or potential profits from licenses from potential discoveries at COMPASS Discovery Center. Smarter people than I can do that analysis...  However, just looking at how high some of the weed stocks got in 2018, I don't think a market cap of $20bn is a stretch (that would put   $CMPS at around $500 to $600 a share  ) if the theme takes off. GW Pharmaceuticals, a cannabis company that specialized in creating medication from cannabis, recently got acquired for $  I put my trust in this star-studded company to do some incredible things.    Positions:    5,500 shares (I don't do options) of $CMPS.    tl;dr:   Psychedelics has the potential to help those with depression, PTSD, addiction, etc. Trust in Peter Thiel and $CMPS to take us to tendieland.
$20k to $  realized gains in 2 months. Holding the rest for double digit millions. GME ofc
GME - My thoughts
First bought in at $20, subsequently bought many more times up to $    I’m well balanced and even now average out at $  including taking enough profit last week to be in the green overall(ahead of what remains invested) and taking into account I invested $  on behalf of my brother which negatively impacts my position.   I’m up.  I’m comfortable.  I can remain in play indefinitely with zero impact.   Having said all that, the perfect time to buy across my whole journey is right now. Squeeze ain’t been squoze. Price is reasonable AF. Future is bright. Marketing is free, and as a side bonus there’s half a chance of breaking a hedge fund.   The future publicity through movies, docos and financial text books is infinite and I can’t see any way that you lose money in the short, medium or long term. The Social network... enough said.  Anyway, you look after you- for me though, this and $pltr are my spare change jar for the next little bit. Bet I’ll be smiling when I stop.   What’s your pick for the next few years?
VFF - The perfect storm in weedstocks
Gonna keep this brief bc apes hate to read. 🍅   VFF has the LOWEST float of any major LP at 65m shares. Deduct the approx 10m shares the ceo owns and you're looking at 55m shares float (add another couple of mil from the insiders/directors and it's even less). Less shares means high volatility means large potential energy means 🔥🔥🔥 in a bull market!  They are profitable right now. No other public LP can claim that now or in all of 2021. Heck CGC just said they won't become fcf positive til 2024. In the immortal words of Chris Tucker, "do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?" Profit = good!  So while they can run with their silly tiny float, they are actually a great company to invest in because they actually make money, have low debt, and have over 100m in the bank.   Low float + profitable rn + weedstocks = 🔥🔥🔥   🍅🍅🍅  And for the simians that can read, check out the recent DDs on them (warning: will require basic math)    (longer, lotsa numbers)    (shorter, fewer numbers)  Edit: join the r/villagefarms sub
Avengers: Age of GME
Why this is just a beginning: a guide for The GME Gang newcomers and a quick recap of the situation
Listen up you fucks, for most of you this is your first rodeo so let me tell you how this whole thing works. Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$   or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.  I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.  Now get these points through your thick head:           This is a fucking volatile stock.     This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while,    keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the  getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:  "I wish I bought at $9..." - when it shot up to $13, and them came down  "I wish I bought at $11..." - when it shot up to $20, and them came down  "I wish I bought at $17..." - when it shot up to $70, and them came down  "I wish I bought at $40..." - when it shot up to $150, and them came down  "I wish I bought at $60..." - when it shot up to $450, and them came down    Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH    I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.                GME was never a squeeze play  , despite what a lot of you retards think.   Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of  . Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.    This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the   s  . The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.  MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play  Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment                Short interest is still through fucking roof  .   I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.      TL;DR:   GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside  If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream "WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ"    Positions:   some Apr 40c, some Apr 200c and a shitload of Jan 2023 950c. Will dump the remaining cash into 2023 calls at open
NYSE v. Off-Exchange(FINRA) Short Volumes for GME: Short Volume in Public Exchanges Wasn't Even Half of Whats Needed for 150% Drop in Short Interest
The drop in SI from 226% to 78% required around \~100 Million shares to cover shorts, but the NYSE only saw 49 Million Short Volume, while OFF-EXCHANGES saw about 3X as much.    Got the   Daily Short Exchange Trade data from NYSE now   so I can compare it to the FINRA numbers that I've been using in the past. General bullet points below:  # TLDR: Check bottom, look at Figure 1, and Napkin Math.         Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded "upstairs" in OFF-EXCHANGES (OTC) but have to be reported... or should be...       Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.       Short sale trades done on NYSE  are NOT in the FINRA data, and vice versa.       The GOOD STUFF is in the       and it isn't out yet for January.       To start out we can compare the total volumes for GME across the public exchange, NYSE, against the off-exchange, FINRA's numbers.        DISCLAIMER: No idea where the Missing Volume is from, but it's not on the NYSE and not being reported to FINRA? Does Yahoo count volume some other way?    I sure as hell didn't know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges, but we got data now. Notice how it really doesn't pick up until the 13th though, and it seems to be settling down as we get further into February.          Figure 1 lays out just exactly where the shorts are going on. Jan 13th nearly used the entirety of the GME Float in the off-exchange.          Figure 2 shows us that around \~50% of all the volume, no matter which exchange, is around shorts, even before Jan 13th.   Jan 19th - 26th, see how the NYSE actually leads in short volume/total volume on those days, WHICH were also the same days that GME shot up toward $400+     Next I wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bi-monthly reports for GME and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the off-exchanges.      FINRA Jan 4th-15th Jan 16th-29th Feb 1st-9th   :- :- :- :-   Short Volume 84,529,878 155,033,361 79,236,275   Short Exempt Volume 1,119,003   3,437,532     4,306,437     Total Volume 193,791,490 415,527,741 146,617,    Short Vol/Float         # NOTE: SHORT EXEMPT VOLUME IS THE ONLY THING NYSE HAS MORE OF THAN OFF-EXCHANGES!      NYSE Jan 4th-15th Jan 16th-29th Feb 1st-9th   :- :- :- :-   Short Volume 13,279,699 49,046,558 19,041,023   Short Exempt Volume 587,776   5,075,452     7,304,781     Total Volume 31,822,868 105,950,709 43,875,824   Short Vol/Float         Now let's use some of these numbers to check some reports.  # NAPKIN MATH TIME  1. So 226% SI for around Jan 15th  and we're at 78% SI reporting now, from end of January. 2. 226-78 = \~150 3. 150% Short Interest = 150 (Shorts/SharesOutstanding) 4. Shares Outstanding = \~70Million 5. 70Million \    =   105 Million Shorts were settled from 15th to 29th    OK, I can believe that 105M shorts went through because that's when GME went up to to $400+  The only thing is, and here's the kicker...  # Of the 100+Million shorts only 49 Million were executed on the                     NYSE during Jan15th to 29th!  We still have 55 Million shorts that were executed those two weeks, and in the FINRA exchanges we can see the155 Million short volume.  But how/where do they do this OFF-EXCHANGE trade you might ask?  # RIGHT ON YOUR DAMN PHONE, Urist McPaperHands!!!!!   "For market makers with a customer order to sell, they will temporarily  sell short (which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination) and then immediately buy from their customer in a  non-media transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double  counting share volumes." \-         If you sold GME via any of those apps, chances are they bought up those shares themselves AFTER they used them to cover their shorts.       The rest of the shorts are just in the ether of OTC exchanges    Granted I can't get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed, how many started to juggle around with options, but we do know that before tonight the SI was above 200% and has been updated to 78%.  I believe that the update is referring to data at the end of January. CORRECT ME IN COMMENTS!!!    TLDR:    1.   NYSE see's only 1/5 the volume that OFF-EXCHANGES do regarding short volumes for GME   2.   "Short Exempts"are nearly twice as prevalent in the NYSE than OTC   3.   Only half of the shorts were executed on the NYSE to decrease SI from 226% to 78%   4.   Still waiting on FINRA for the          Not advice of any kind, I should have been writing my thesis instead of this shit, and I miss chewy runts!  Edit:  u/SolveThisProblem pointed out that different sites use different definitions for SI: In the post I used short/(outstanding shares (yahoo finance) to calculate the 226% to 78% SI change, however Morningstar/FINRA  use shorts/ float which is (Outstanding Shares - Insider Holdings - Untrading lnst. Holdings.)
NVAX - 3 to 4x potential - Market ignoring recurring revenue
As NVAX was late to party, analysts estimated its initial revenue lower.  But given the   for annual vaccination. In such scenario, NVAX is actually better placed than Moderna.  So Q2 2020 onwards, I dont see NVAX revenue to be lower than Moderna. Market is already beginning to realize that. I expect its market cap to come inline           I believe most people are likely to go for Novavax when it comes to next jab because:  1.   2. Cheaper (<= $16 per dose) 3. Virus variants are becoming bigger problem.   4. They plan to make a   \- so instead of annual flu vaccine, people can simply go for combo 5. And obviously    It seems incredible that `NVAX market cap is just $20B when Moderna is valued at $71B`. To reach $71B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to   $1116         It can be argued that lower price than Moderna means lower revenue. But lower price coupled with no deep freeze requirement will translate to much higher market share. On top of that, they already have another very successful vaccine (Nanoflu - influenza) which completed phase 3 trial in March 2020.  On Jan 29th, Principal investigator of their UK trial had expected  . It seems we should be pretty close to next price action now.  Disclosure: I am long Nvax March 19 calls
Shaq, Lebron, & TikTok's Ex-CEO company JUST announced its $3B merger with Beachbody (Full Retard Mode ACTIVATED)
I'm about go full retard.  Some people involved with this (which is honestly a big part of why I'm about to Forest Gump my ass through Vietnam, across the fucking country, and back home to lose my virginity to a chick with AIDs just to get this thing):    Shaq   Kevin Mayer, Former TikTok CEO   Lebron "hold my dick" James   Arnold Schwarzenegger   Tom Staggs, former Disney CFO & COO  The announcement    just    came out.   for those of you with actual attention spans.  For those that don't. Here are the   highlights  :  "Fitness-and-nutrition business the Beachbody Company Group LLC plans to merge with a blank-check company affiliated with former TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer in a deal that values the combined company at nearly $3 billion."  As part of the deal, Myx Fitness LLC, an at-home connected cycling provider, will become part of The Beachbody Company.  Beachbody is expected to generate more than $  billion of revenue this year.  "Beachbody said it plans to use the capital to expand its sales and digital marketing efforts and to enter new geographies"  Other awesome things about this team:    Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger are involved (to what extent, I'm not sure but Beachbody     The company      My Basic DD:    The company is well diversified between 3 separate entities. Each with complementary but different offerings. The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.  Peloton is due for a competitor. It's a great platform but it's not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness' products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.  The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance that the biz actual works  Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and    HEAVY    digital marketing spend.  Again, this literally   JUST   came out like an hour ago.
I know you were apes, but not THAT retarded
First of all: Alle the GME movement was like a week ago and you retards got stopped by a never seen change of rules.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?  I only see whining and retards complaining. It's NOTHING, compared to timeframes we seen on WSB so far and you still can't get your ass up and fucking HOLD and believe in what we want to achieve.  When the stonk blew, we couldn't stop the posts and memes about how GME is going to moon and everybody was circlejerking, but as soon as some retards on wallstreet spread lies and change rules, you hush and start being nervous and SELL. WHAT IS WORNG WITH YOU RETARDS? They got EXACTLY what they wanted. And you know what the worst part is?    YOU RETARDS EVEN TOLD US THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN.    Did you think that the hedge funds would just run away in fear and loose their face AND money? Didn't you think they'd fight with dirty moves and get away with it? Haven't you learned from 2008?  Face it! We're apes. And now we're not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?  I'm not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270€ for 2k€, because I have debts of 10k€ and a lawsuit going against me. I can't afford to pay back anymore because COVID made me loose my job. I'm basically fucked and don't know what to do and stand with my back at the wall. But guess what?    I STILL HOLD.    This isn't about money anymore. This isn't about saving before shit goes down. This isn't about believe that the squeeze will come.    This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.    And so should you! Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.  For ONE fucking time in your life - just do   NOTHING   and   HOLD  .  WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is. And if they played by the rules, we'd have fucked them in a very autistic and ironic way. But guess what. War isn't held by rules.  tl;dr: you sell = bad monke. you hold = we'll see us on moon   PS: Dear millionaires, please buy GME and safe ~~us~~ me, I don't care about this autists  PSS: This is not financial advice, I'm just an ape that really likes this stock  EDIT: Thanks for gold <3  EDIT2 for the true retards: 6 GME@280€, 3 GME@160€, 1 GME@50€ and some AMC  EDIT3:         🤚

GameStonk Theory
“This is not financial advice”
You are all fucking retarded. Is it something that makes you feel special? This is a public forum. Jesus Christ. Honestly, the one thing that makes me discount your opinion the most is uttering those insignificant words that I assume make you feel important somehow. Stop saying that, I never saw that shit on this subreddit before this whole catastrophe. And the Ape shit. This shit is fucking stupid. What is going on? You don’t have to say “this is not financial advice” on Reddit. Ever. Fuck you
Can we stop with the "Us vs Them" narrative around $GME?
Seriously. Ya'll sound like a bunch of kool-aid drinking cargo cult dipshits.   The reason $GME took off is because it was an undervalued company that was signaling significant change in direction and added some big swinging dicks that could actually drive that change. The short interest was a cherry on top.  Then you dumb fuck bag holding idiots hoped on and made it about some kind of principle or something. I don't even fucking know. You all sound like those hippy dipshits that hung out in tents all those years ago - and look what happened to them - they got literally bulldozed and nothing changed.  You know what that shit sounds like to anyone who is a serious investor that wants to make money? It sounds straight up fucking retarded. I'm not gonna park my money on a rocketship that's piloted by some shit-stain that needs to wear a helmet just to take a dump.   Get the fuck outta here with that shit. Talk about what you actually like about the stock and maybe you can restart the hype train a little. The more you twats talk about this like it's some epic battle you're winning, the more you sound like bag holders who aren't smart enough to know what the fuck an exit strategy is.   TL;DR - Hold the stock because you like it and see the legit opportunity in the company. Not because you need to wear a helmet to make toast and think it's some epic struggle.

Hey you dumbfucks. The Mods are NOT “””compromised”””. Shut the fucking fuck up you literal children. Listen here.    How many times do we need to tell you that this community has   MORE THAN QUADRUPLED   in a matter of weeks?  How many fucking bullshit confirmation bias noninformative literally made-up “DD” posts do you want?   zjz and his bots are gone.  It sucks and they are trying to fix it, but that’s the fucking reality.  But zjz themselves threw their support behind our current mods.   Stop being needy immature little fucks  .  I’ll say it again.      THE SELLOUT MODS WERE BANNED BY REDDIT. OUR CURRENT MODS ARE LEGIT.  ZJZ OPENLY SUPPORTS THE CURRENT TEAM.      AutoMod is going to have to be strict.  It’s not fucking personal and there’s no conspiracy.  Please stop being fucking idiots, except for the type of idiot who sells 2 $780p thinking it’s free money.       In the words of one of our own team:     “One of the many reasons why we miss zjz is because of the awesome work he put into tweaking and optimizing his bots to keep submissions manageable. Between losing him and gaining a massive influx of users, the spam filter is going haywire blocking posts that should go through and approving shitposts that don't deserve to see the light of day. The mod team audits what we can manually, but you have to remember we're a small group of real life humans (plus a bot or two) managing   degenerates.     When you see spam/shitposts, the most important thing you can do is to hit the report button. It may not be addressed right away, but we'll take them out as soon as we can and hand out bans to spammers.”     GoodNIGHT.        eat👅shit🍑automod

Southwest ($LUV) For Reopening (long term play) - and how to do your own DD
Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night wondering which airline stock you should go long for the post-pandemic reopening? Well autist, if this is you, then you should stick around for this DD. I'll be comparing the four hottest airlines and make a case for why I $LUV Southwest. This can also serve as a walkthrough if you still don't know how to do your own DD. So grab a beer, strap on your helmet, and review the alphabet one more time, because hopefully by the end of this you'll learn how to do your own DD.  # Financials  Ok, let's start by examining some financial metrics. Now, we don't want to just look at a snapshot of these companies' financials at the end of 2020; we also want to see what these metrics looked like before some guy decided to chow on some bat soup. This will help to give us an idea of how they changed and what to look forward to as we approach reopening.  For the 7 million of  you new here (holy fuck), or for those of you with aggressively smooth brains, I'll go over some of the more complicated metrics.      P/E ratio   (price-to-earnings ratio) - share price divided by EPS. This can help us determine the relative value of a company's share price compared to its competitors.     P/S ratio   (price-to-sales ratio) - market capitalization divided by revenue. This shows how much investors think each share is worth compared to the company's revenue.     Profit Margin   \- profit divided by revenue. This tells us what percent of revenue actually turns into profit.  These are simple calculations, and you can find all the data necessary on yahoo finance \[1\]. If you don't know what profit, revenue, EPS, or market cap are, then at this point just buy 0DTE SPY puts and hope for the best. Below is a table of these metrics for UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV for the year 2019.      Ticker Share Price (EOY) Market Cap Revenue Profit P/E P/S Profit Margin   :- :- :- :- :- :- :- :-   UAL $88 $  $  $  7333       AAL $27 $  $  $  7105       DAL $58 $  $  $  7945       LUV $54 $  $  $  12558          LUV's P/E and P/S ratios from 2019 may suggest that it was overvalued compared to the other airlines. But this won't matter to you once we see how much better they are doing compared to the rest of the field in 2020. Below is a table of the same metrics for these airlines for the year 2020.      Ticker Share Price (EOY) Market Cap Revenue Profit P/E P/S Profit Margin   :- :- :- :- :- :- :- :-   UAL $43 $  $  \  \    \    AAL $16 $  $  \  \    \    DAL $40 $  $  \  \    \    LUV $47 $  $  \  \    \       Again, the P/E and P/S ratios could suggest that LUV is overvalued compared to the rest of the field, but a valuation above its competitors is warranted because of how much better its profit and profit margins are. But these metrics are just a part of the picture; we also want to analyze a company's balance sheet to see how it fairs in terms of its total assets and liabilities.  # Balance Sheet  A company's balance sheet can easily be located on their annual 10-K or quarterly 10-Q SEC filings \[2\]. The data for this analysis will be extracted from each company's 10-Q form for Q3 (since not all of them have filed a 10-K for 2020). The two sections on the balance sheet we want to pay close attention to are the assets and liabilities.  In the current assets section, we'll be looking at AR (accounts receivable) and most importantly CASH, because CASH is KING. It's important for a company to have lots of cash on hand because it shows how able they are to pay off short term debts. There are other sources of assets listed in the file, but I'll skip those since they aren't as important as cash and AR.  In the current liabilities section, we'll be looking at AP (accounts payable) and maturing debt (debt that is owed pretty soon). All you need to know about AR and AP is that they are basically opposites. AR is money that a third party owes the company pretty damn soon, and AP is money that the company owes a third party pretty damn soon. A good rule of thumb is that these values should generally match up. Here as well, there are other sources of liabilities listed in the file, but I'm skipping them because they aren't as important as debt and AP.  Lastly, we'll also take a look at long-term debts and debt-to-equity ratio, to determine how much debt a company has to pay off in the future and how much debt they are leveraging to finance their assets.  Still with me? Ok good, more numbers now. Shown below is a table of the current assets of UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV.      Ticker Total Current Assets Cash Accounts Receivable   :- :- :- :-   UAL $  $  $    AAL $  $  $    DAL $  $  $    LUV $  $  $    There are two things you should note about this table. First, around 75% of LUV's total assets is cold hard cash. We like to see that. This also compares closely with UAL's cash. But another thing to note is how dogshit AAL's small pp pile of cash is. They're in some shit and will probably have to leverage more debt to make short-term payments. But regardless of that, so far so good for LUV. But let's see how everyone is doing with their liabilities. Shown below is a table of the current liabilities of these airlines.      Ticker Total Current Liabilities Current maturities of long-term debt Accounts Payable   :- :- :- :-   UAL $  $  $    AAL $  $  $    DAL $  $  $    LUV $  $  $    Hopefully by now you're starting to see how much doper LUV is compared to its competitors. LUV has more than double the current assets to liabilities, less than $1 billion in short-term debt (which is easily covered by their amount of cash), and generally equal AR and AP. No other company listed here checks all three boxes.  Finally, we'll examine long-term debt and debt-to-equity ratio shown in the table below.      Ticker Long-term Debt Debt-to-Equity Ratio   :- :- :-   UAL $      AAL $  \    DAL $      LUV $      Immediately glaring off that table is the fact that DAL is levered to the tits and AAL has a negative debt-to-equity ratio. So in essence, DAL is dogshit, and AAL is dogshit wrapped in catshit. But our shining star LUV has a debt-to-equity ratio of only   which, when considering how the pandemic has impacted air travel, is pretty fucking stellar. And compared to the rest of the field, LUV is sitting pretty with only $10 billion in long-term debt.  # Business Operations  Now that we've seen the numbers, it's time to dig a little deeper to see how Southwest's business operations will lead it through the reopening. Most of the following information can be found in Southwest's 10-K filing (I'll link any alternative sources). Southwest began operations in 6 new airports in 2020 and plans to begin operations in 8 more airports in 2021, including Chicago O'Hare (hint: that's a big one).  The Boeing 737 MAX also has a role to play in all of this. These aircraft are more fuel efficient than their predecessors (hint: this saves costs), and Southwest is quick to add them to their fleet. I know you're probably thinking the MAX is dangerous and a liability to the company, but I promise you the MAX is probably the safest plane in the sky right now because Boeing knows they'd be in deep shit if they fucked it up again. Southwest will start flying MAXs again in March, and they currently lease or own 41 of these aircraft, which is about 5% of their fleet. This year they will be adding 107 more MAX 7s and MAX 8s, which will then make up 17% of their fleet.  But what really sets Southwest apart from these other large airlines is that the vast majority of their business is domestic, so during a reopening economy, they will see operations return to normal much faster than their competitors that also rely on revenue from international flights.  Finally, Southwest continues to offer low fares in part due to their use of higher complexity flight plan optimization models. They use linear flight systems instead of the simpler and more common hub and spoke methods that other airlines utilize \[3\]. If all that flew over your head, don't worry, all you need to know is that this helps Southwest save costs.  # Institution Holdings  For any DD, it's also important to see if institutions own a certain stock. It's always good to have the big boys on your side in an investment. Let's see how institutional ownership compares across the airlines we've been studying.      Ticker Institutional Ownership   :- :-   UAL     AAL     DAL     LUV     As you can see, the big boys favor LUV over the rest \[4\].  # Technicals  Fuck outta here with your crayons. This is a DD for a long-term play so miss me with those head and shoulders, cup and handle, batman, or dick n balls lookin ass patterns.  # Final Notes on Macroeconomic Trends  After being locked down for a year, there's going to be some serious pent up demand for vacations and travel. Southwest is in a perfect position to meet these demands with its low fares, and will emerge from the pandemic mostly unscathed relative to its competitors. Also, two bags fly free? Say no more fam. With that being said, I think Southwest is on pace to eclipse its ATH and I see its share price worth no less than $80 EOY (maybe more considering the retard strength of this market).  However, this thesis and price target is completely invalid if the market turns bearish, no matter how successful the reopening is for airlines. But, as long as the Federal Reserve continues to support the heights of this market, then calls on everything.     Positions: LUV 1/20/23 70C     If you made it this far, congratulations. If you didn't, fuck you, read the TL;DR I guess. Did I leave anything important out? Do you disagree with my thesis because of some critical information that I didn't pick up on? Let me know. Also if you enjoyed this and want to see another DD, I'll take some suggestions.     TL;DR    LUV profited way better than its competitors during the pandemic   LUV has a great balance sheet compared to its competitors   LUV is adding more destinations and using more MAX aircraft ($$$$$)   Institutions love LUV   Pent up demand for travel this year means $$$$$$     Sources:  1.   2.   3.   4.

Do Market Makers need to report naked short sales ?
Apparently Market Makers can perform naked short sales if it's in the course of bona fide market making or whatever     I was curious if they need to report to FINRA but I haven't found anything that clarifies that one way or another, however I did find this one letter that is on the   portal using google lol, this is from 2003 though!  So maybe the rules have been updated since? Anyways here's the letter     The relevant quote "There is another provision that says that the market makers do not have to publish their open naked short positions. Never. At all. "
Why BB's Contract with Motional is Bigger than We Realise.
There are already numerous posts about the news that can out today but I wanted to put this out there because I saw a common theme among the comments that a lot of people don't know how big Motional is.       I had the same reaction until I looked them up. Motional is not some fly-by-night start-up.   1. They are a $4 Billion joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv where Hyundai put in $  Billion dollars and has the backing of the South Korean government which expects them to have fleet rollout by 2024.   That means we know there's some serious intent with this company and they have the money to pay for BB's products.       2. Motional isn't just a concept, it has a product out on the roads right now. As of Feb last year, they already had 100k paying customers via Lyft. That's right, they already had a soft roll out. They are targetting a full self driving robotaxi service with lift in 2023.       3. On the same note, they are launching robotaxis with Via in the first half of this year. This year!       4. Along with Amazon WS IVY partnership expecting to make bank in 2023. It seems like BB is poised for an explosion in revenues starting in 2023. Most tech companies out there are priced well into the future yet BB seems to be priced for this or next year at most. If the market can wake up to this then BB could do really well.   This is on top of Baidu, and all the existing clients of QNX.   Those are just my own thoughts so I welcome further discussion.   Obligatory          because Papa Chen said we were going to the Moon.
$f Ford is a huge money making opportunity right now! Easy 3x in a few months when Mach-e starts hitting the streets
Basics. Market cap is smallish roughly 40bIl. Means even if they double they are still tiny compared to Tesla! Even if the 10x they are half the size of Tesla. This means room to grow      Everyone knows “Ford” there’s rumors a merger with Tesla but I don’t think it would ever happen the brand “Ford” is like Disney to famous be acquired but it’s a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.  They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy brands and consumer loyalty. Has factors in place already ready to   up EV FAST!      F-150 going electric in a few years this is THE truck there really isn’t any other truck out there because Ford is undeniably the best truck maker in the world.  Cheaper because of EV government credits which Tesla doesn’t get anymore.      New CEO! Who reshaping and got the business back on track! Auto sales are up significantly and they closed under performing regions.         Smashed q4 earnings! Made money instead of expected losses    Joe Biden loves FORD and thanked them in 2014 for “saving our ass”    Analysts are already getting on board! Upgrades starting to pop out everywhere!           Jim Cramer pushes and owns Ford so free press on mad money!   All this means significantly undervalued company that’s going to the MOON        Price target $30 end of year! End of 2022 $100  Positions  200x 20c 1/22/22  EdIT proof of position    Disclaimer this is not investment advice just shooting the shit with my degen buddies on wsb and their wives boyfriends. Do some research  EDIT ADDED PIC OF MY 2022 $20 calls.  Edit2  “Not to mention they're one of 3 companies in the running for a multi billion dollar deal with the USPS to manufacture EV mail trucks and they have the strongest chance at getting it considering their history providing vehicles for the government and that one of the other companies is a European company.”
Time to talk about UNG
Mods blocked my first post for some reason so here it is again  Haven't heard much on WSB about the freezing cold hitting the US these next weeks so I wanted to point out a strategy with retard level returns. About half the homes in the use  .  Why does this matter? Supply and Demand baby production has not recovered from its its drop last year and is not expected to return to normal until   that surplus will be a deficit by Feb 19. At that point working storage is going to be 2000 BCF.  Here is the kicker there working storage can't go lower than 1000 Bcf of gas because there needs to be natural gas in the pipelines for them to work. The closer it gets to this number there, the price of natgas is going to shoot up!! Officially working storage does not stop getting emptied until the 2nd week of April meaning there is going be 8 weeks of withdraws.  The best part is that there will always be a buyer for natural gas!! Utilities will always need to buy  natural gas for electrical generation. Right now they are in denial and just keep wishing that the problem goes away. But just ask   what happens when storage starts to run low!!!    Why buy now   its cheap right now, most traders are waiting for winter to verify and the utilities are hoping that it never happens. Of course you should only be trying this if you can afford to.  $UNG is the ETF that tracks natural gas and will start going to the moon the lower the storage goes.  There are also many natural gas producers that will benefit with the rise of the price. This is especially true if management takes advantage of the price move and locks in prices for the rest of the year (they have the ability to do that) .  Because this is WSB I found the Natural gas producer with the largest short percentage at 16%. That would be RRC  For those of you that want to follow the      TLDR:   If you can afford to buy UNG now because its gonna get really cold in the US for the next three weeks. If you want to go full retard and attempt a short squeeze RRC is your best bet with 16% of its volume float at 16%.  Full Disclosure: 200 UNG 16 APR 21 13 C and 20 RRC 18 Jun 21 11 C  As always I'm not a financial advisor just a 3 week old WSB retard
You have become a part of a larger universe
You just don't know it yet.   You can call me an ambassador of sorts. I've noticed your rule about sub one billion market capitalization companies. And I get it. I really do. Keep the rule in place. But I implore you to consider making an exception for a small company that could run further than GameStop and create a future brighter than any one of us would think possible.  Castor Merritime  They have amazing fundamentals and an amazing community.  Mods, if you could find it in your hearts to allow the ticker to be posted here you will change the world.

Why Alex needs to crash the stock...
Lockup expiry is comin. If the price is good enough a bunch of employees will cash out and go on to start their own startups. Alex needs these folks to stay on to grow the company (hence the going overboard on ESOPS). So he needed to crash the stock today hence the bullshit sandbagging of growth expectations during todays PLTR call. He is trying to hold on employees by making them think I should wait till 45 before selling my stock. And even though I can leave I better stay and make sre the company grows so that the stock hits 45 again.

The least sexiest move: Shipping container stocks.
Import/export and shipping container stocks  Listen up apes! Some least exciting stocks with room for growth in the current economic situation are shipping & shipping container stocks. The growth potential is being caused by global macroeconomic causes. Currently there is a shipping container shortage due to high demand of overseas freight. The US is buying consumer goods from China in record volumes ( surge of at-home goods, PPE, fitness equipment etc. produced in China). (Also why your wife can’t get that pelaton rn) This has lead to the increase in shipping container transport costs. A typical shipping container pre-pandemic would go for around $1,500 from China to the US, then be loaded back with soy beans,and other things(or whatever China wants) to send back. Due to the high volume shipping companies have increased the container shipping (or “lease” of container space) price to the US around $4,800+  It has become so profitable for shipping & container companies that they are preferring to send containers back empty to China to be put back in queue for US goods to be exported. Meaning the trip from China to the US alone is so profitable it pays for the roundtrip costs itself without needing return cargo back to China.   Companies and exporters who want to ship abroad pay a heftier premium and either have difficulty finding a container or space to ship goods internationally now. If the product is a high enough priority they may elect to send it by more expensive air cargo. Stocks with growth potential are, Triton Int. (TRTN), CAI to name a   there are others do your DD.) Triton released its Q4 earnings report today 2/16 with positive revenue(337M)and EPS(  up from Q3. These stocks have potential in the midterm to longer term for growth. (That’s right no sexy shorts here) Trade disputes between China and the US could also spark more growth in the stocks(in favor of China currently) , but trade policy revisions by the Biden administration could quickly cool any spikes in shipping and stock prices.   Just an opinion not financial advice.
Personal opinion: Increased my GME position by about 20% today, not recommending you do the same.
It could very well continue to go down, but even so, I'm only adding about 4% to total dollar amount ~~wasted~~ "invested" for a 25% reduction in cost average. It's a small price to pay for a significant risk reduction.   My reasons for not writing this stock off:  1) Like many here, I got into it late in the game and \~80% down as of right now. The current residual risk of losing 100% of the investment is only 20%. The potential upside is much higher.  2) There is a large amount of calls up to $800 for the next 4 weeks that were bought by much bigger entities than baby powder snorting retards of this subreddit like myself. I want to see how that plays out.  3) There are ongoing government inquiries, no global consensus on the SI, and lots of other factors that make it a useless exercise to try to predict anything at the moment.  4) I'm not much of a gamer, but I actually like the company. I think there's a lot of opportunity for growth from many angles, just based on the industry alone. I feel like we're kind of maxed out as a society on creating original movies. I don't believe that we can just continue cloning sequels and remakes like the Hollywood's been doing for the past 10 years. Video games on another hand are becoming more and more immersive and are equally fun and story-rich as movies, some may argue even better. Generationally, more and more people are going to be accustomed to gaming as well as they get older. The shift will take some time, but it's already happening.  TLDR: Whatever it is you do in life, don't panic, take deep breaths, hydrate, get outside, and and listen to good music.  Not financial advise. My job is in risk management that has nothing to do with finances and I know nothing about stocks.

With the SAFE/MORE act currently getting passes in congress and Schumer making moves towards legalization, US MSOs are getting closer than ever to being listed on NASDAQ and when institutional investors have access to the US cannabis industry... All hell breaks loose. The largest names right now are Green Thumb, Trulieve, Curaleaf, and Cresco Labs. No need to get smoked gambling on Canadian Cannabis companies, US MSOs have a huge advantage and are already established across the country for the moment legalization comes. I'm passing yall the boof on this one. Do with this information what you will. I currently have positions in Green Thumb and Curaleaf.  edit: If you're stuck with a shit broker and don't have access to OTC market and you can still profit off US MSOs with the ETF (MSOS)!  tl;dr: US cannabis companies are on a massive discount on the OTC market, massive potential gains when they get listed on NASDAQ
Can we talk about MVIS yet? 1000 shares at $  started this.
$OPEN Opendoor DD – From a Realtor Industry Insider
Edit: adding    🏠📈🌕  Edit: Cathie Wood has a ton of this in ARK ETFs already  I’m a Realtor in one of the test markets for Opendoor (Charlotte) and I firmly believe that this company is going to go far.  They are going to completely disrupt and revitalize the real estate industry.  A bit of background about me and my credentials for writing this Due Diligence: I have been a licensee since early 2013. My husband is real estate closing attorney . His office handles 300+ real estate closings per month with 4 offices and 18-20 full-time employees.  My husband was not always a real estate closing attorney. Back in 2010 – 2015, his main bread and butter was handling foreclosure defense. He represented people who were facing foreclosure and helped them avoid it by delaying the process through the court system, helping them apply for and obtain loan modifications or negotiating short sales with their lender. Back then, the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were a lot of people who were upside down in their houses. They simply couldn’t sell them and move on. They owed way more money than houses were selling for and had to convince the bank to allow them to sell the house. The fed bailed out the banks  by allowing short sales and taking a lesser payoff than what was originally lent out, but the process for getting them to agree to do so on an individual level was long, complicated and very difficult. As a Realtor, I assisted with this many times and listed dozens of short sales. During the markets in 2008-2014, this was a huge majority of houses.  Around 2015, the scales tipped back and the market, for the most part, was nearly recovered. Currently, there are no short sales. VERY rare, if so.  Currently, the market in Charlotte is such that inventory cannot keep up with the demand. I talked to a Realtor yesterday who was in the middle of a bidding war with 53 other offers on the table. It is common for most houses to get 20+ offers within hours of listing. It’s an absolute bloodbath out there.  To say that I understand this industry is an understatement. I know it in and out, up and down, left and right. I eat, sleep and dream in real estate and have for a long time.  iBuying is going to shift the entire landscape of how real estate is purchased. I am seeing it happen here now, in real time. So, let me explain…  Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. This current age of free data and knowledge with the internet  has slowly started to shift that power away from them over the past 20 years. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.  Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and   Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads. It’s ironic, but Realtors have funded the vehicles that will be the end of their industry eventually.  Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.  In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.  You take a lot of Xanax in this industry….  Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings. Seller doesn’t have to deal with fixing up their house or repair negotiations. Seller doesn’t have to hear about the buyer’s demands. Seller doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama. Seller doesn’t have to deal with Realtors. Seller doesn’t have to pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%). Seller is in control. Seller has total power of the transaction. Opendoor makes it easy.  Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.  Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.  Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule. No working around some Realtor’s schedule. The buyer has the power to steer the ship in their own home buying process.  When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.  Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.  Opendoor: “ If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”  And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.  Opendoor: “ Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”  Now is the time where I recommend you move over to   and spend 5 minutes browsing their website directly. You will quickly see how easy the interface is to navigate. Yes, even for the retards on this sub.  In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.  The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market.  As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.  Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings (NOT my husband) scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.    Comment from an Opendoor employee on my original post:   /u/casrox  I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(  is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.    wHat AbOuT tHe CrAsH cOmInG! wE aRe In A bUbBlE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.  The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.  The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.  Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Asaets. This simply can't happen anymore are at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing.   Sidenote: I bought a foreclosure and the prior owner took out 3 cash out refis in 2007 within the same week. He didn't tell the lenders about one another at all. There was NO underwriting process that would have caught this at the time. The guy took all the cash and used it to buy a horse ranch in the same city. He never made a payment to any of the 3 lenders and knew it would go to foreclosure. He didn't care because he won. He beat the system, and you know what? He got away with it. Because he was one of thousands just like him who did the exact same thing and the banks realized it would be cheaper to eat it than fight it through the court systems and try to collect against most people who had no assets. This was 2008.  This will never be possible again.    wHaT AbOuT tHe PaNdEmIc and tHe ImPeNdInG FoReClOsUrEs????    As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.  Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.    tHiS iS lIKe CARVANA, bUt ReAl EsTaTe iS rIsKiEr.    No, owning real estate is no riskier than owning cars.    Cars are a depreciating asset.      Real estate is an appreciating asset.    95% of millionaires are made with owning real estate, myself included.  Many people see real estate as a safer store of value than even gold or other goods. Definitely safer than having it sit in the bank.  Of course there are exceptions to everything. People are able to sell their house after owning it for 30 years and make retirement level money. People retire off their equity. You can't sell your daily driver after using it for 10 years and make the equivalent rate of return. Appreciating vs depreciating. Of course exceptions exist like Condos in RE and rare classic cars. But for the most part, in 99% situations, real estate gains value while personal property loses it. This is economics 101.    Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.    My Response:  Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.  Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.  People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.  Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.    tHiS iS tHe UbEr Of HoUsEs:    No, it’s not. Uber has zero assets. They don’t own a single car.  They have nothing but their systems and software.  Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies that literally own nothing like DoorDash, Airbnb, etc.  Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.   Okay, I think I’m going to wrap this up. I’m sure Ill think of more stuff and will add to it later but I have to get some work done.    My position: 14 contracts, calls shorts and leaps. 1000 shares.

[$SE] Multi-year Emerging Market Growth - This is the Way
Alright, listen up my fellow autists. I was drafting this DD up to put in my private archives, but this place isn't autistic enough anymore. Apes are too alpha with their diamond hands and I'm here to bring you some plays to put tendies on the table like good ol days.  I'm here to talk about what's for some reason an under followed stock.            BUT WHAT IS $SE?!?!?!?   Sea Limited is a leading E-commerce, digital payments, and mobile gaming company based in Southeast Asia NOT COMMIE TOWN CHINA (disclaimer I'm long $BABA). They operate through those three segments and benefit from synergies between them.  Let's start with   E-commerce   It's the middle of a fucking GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I bet your house is filled with cardboard boxes up to the ceilings. At least mine is. I'm buying a lot of shit online, because I'm working from home, trading in my PJs and making FAT STACKS off $SE. While I don't live in Malaysia, I use Amazon. It's the future. Look at the entire brick and mortar retail industry over the last 5-10 years  cough  GME  cough . Things aren't so hot. You can get things cheaper and exactly what you want.   I feel this part of the thesis is pretty self explanatory. Do you believe people will continue to buy things online over the next 10 years?      Yes -> buy $SE    No -> Go buy GME lol  But how are they doing? FUCKING GREAT. I have access to some proprietary app data I'm too lazy to smuggle off my work PC, but let me say. Things are UP. Downloads, DAU, session length, all the metrics. BOOMIN. Don't believe me? Here's how they've been doing vs. local competitors ($BABA owned Lazada) and a private company rumored to be involved with a one of those special purpose tickers (Tokopedia).    $SE   mainly competes in its e-commerce segment in the Southeast Asia market. It's key countries are Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil.  As shown here using google trends, we see that Shopee is now claiming the top spot in relative search interest in many of these markets.         (Blue)  -    (Red)  -    (Yellow)      Source:      :// ,lazada,tokopedia        Digital Payments.   $SE also has a digital wallet app. This is Southeast Asia. They don't have JP Morgan pulling from everyone's pockets. Everyone's got a phone and uses this in tandem to purchase things online. Did I mention that $SE has both B2C and C2C shopping apps? Want to transact with local business? Process payments and handle your small business checking through $SE. Makes it easy to track and receive payments from customers. Fucking great. Basically lets the company pull a sliver from every transaction going on in their markets.         Mobile Gaming.   What's that? Boom Beach is for dads? I know. Doesn't matter, the rest of the world loves this shit. Their mobile gaming division is called Garena and their biggest game is a battle royale called Free Fire:   >Garena is a leading esports organizer. It hosts esports events around the world that range from grassroots local tournaments to some of the most viewed professional esports competitions globally. Garena’s largest global esports tournament of 2019, the Free Fire World Series, achieved over 130 million cumulative online views.         Why it's interesting? Recent IPO (relatively). This thing is less than 2 years public and absolutely on a tear. Market cap of $140 billion is especially compelling. Consider that the  .  It's a company you value on the top-line. So in a region with 8-10% GDP growth, and 10%+ ecommerce growth it's easy to make a case for 20% top-line growth on right there. Now lets consider an increasing shift in spend from brick and mortar to digital of 10% (you make 1 out of 10 purchases online more than you did last year) and gaining market share. 50% growth isn't hard to achieve on this piece of the business alone. And that's ANNUAL.   How to play it? LEAPS. Shares are for apes and frees up cash for FDs on pull backs (if it drops more than 10% hammer the ask on all the 20% OTM 60 DTE you can get).      TL;DR? EDUCATE YOURSELF AND READ IT. THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME.    $SE $350 2023 Cs - This is the way
AMZN is SEVERELY UNDERVALUED
AMZN is only $3245 at the time of writing this. It should easily be sitting above $4500 per share. Amazon is a global supermassive behemoth. It's body is the world's largest online retailer, but it also has tentacles in produce and groceries, delivery, handmade markets, drone innovation, and a robust variety of electronics that integrate flawlessly into the Internet-of-Things.     Amazon is a company far ahead of its time! It's global influence will only continue to grow, and I see nothing but profits. We could easily get this stock about $4000 to show the world its potential, and then the rest of the world would just carry us on to profits! In 10 years time, we will see new homes built specifically to integrate into Amazon's IoT with laundry rooms and kitchens having smart order buttons to refill depleted detergents and groceries! Speakers in every room will allow your music to flawlessly follow you around your home! Smartbulbs will sense when you enter and leave a room as well as daylight conditions to maximize energy saving capabilities as well as provide the perfect amount of lighting!     AMZN is not just the future, it will be a way of life! But only if WE do our part in showing the market what it is capable of!     This isn't financial advice, I like this stock!
More CNBC lies..
And its not that I myself traded on their information at all.  It just bothers me they keep making shit up.    As I'm sitting in the wendy's drive thru yesterday, these morons are talking about cannabis stocks and how they are mostly canadian and can't benefit from the bill passing ect ect.      Anyways, they say "Sundial Growers are taking advantage of this rally and raising funds"    I then go look at the SEC filings and they haven't filed a damn thing since 2/4.     i only listen to CNBC to get info on stocks i shouldn't buy.
Weed!
Smoke week and read this about GME  Crossposting. This keeps getting removed. Think why   Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!  In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:  I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on   average)  Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:  As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)  Now what about Fidelity users:  32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)  DEGiro has 600K users:  600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro  What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212  ​  ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct  so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares  ​  Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!  We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM  OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!  Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)  38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available  ==============>>>>>>>>>>>> GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!  ​  Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted  67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!  ​     In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.  32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??  ​  TNDLR  Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%  Institutions hold 113 %  Total= 193 % shares are on the market  SO the real Shorts number is 138%  ​  ​  Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be £Greedy ::  If you see mistakes please correct me....  ​  Alright even if living abroad not financial adviser just sharing my DD so please share for those paper hands scared and let's enjoy the road.... ;)  Cheers!  ​  From Luxembourg with Love !  ​  ADDED AFTER COMMENTS:  1. yes I forgot the world and Revolut and other APP 2. Read that article     Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will "only pay" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.     Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)  Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....
Help small business and make $, Invest in regional banks : $KRE 70 April / 80 Leaps
Howdy, you might remember when i came to this community and offered you this idea when KRE was at 36. I'm guessing no because the gay mods deleted my post, here's a screenshot :        the KRE Rally is not over and here is why :  Regional banks, more so than the big money centers in XLF make their $ by taking loans from the FED or depositors who block their money for a year or two and lend it for longer maturities. The best proxy for this metric is the 10/2 spread and it has been going to the moon !        Regional banks are the entities that are most exposed to "small business" in the market, in fact if you want to go long the "real economy", KRE is about your only bet along with some office/mall REITS/B2B stocks and the true winner, which hasn't been frontran yet of the upcoming reopening is the real economy.   Have you heard that papi biden is working on   another stimulus package focused on infrastructure ?   Who loans the money to the small bizes who work on that shit ? you guessed it, KRE. I think most of the market has a hard time understanding the size and potential impact of what the dems are cooking for us, here's an excerpt from top strategist at MS leila :       Unprecedented stimulus      – The magnitude of monetary + fiscal stimulus in the US is almost hard for the brain to fully appreciate. We’re not economists, but it appears as if we are on track for \~9 Trillion between fiscal + monetary in the US, over 3x what we did during the financial crisis.  On the fiscal side, if Biden gets his $  Trillion on the back of Trump’s $  Trillion + $900 Billion plans, total Fiscal stimulus over the past year will be \~$5 Trillion or \~24% of   GDP.  The 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus amounted to \~ $1 Trillion -- so we're doing 5x the fiscal.  On the Monetary side, the Fed Balance sheet has risen by $  Trillion since 2019. In 2008-2010 it rose $  Trillion, so we're doing   the Monetary.   These monetary and fiscal efforts in the US equate to over 40% of GDP.      But isn't the fed keeping interest rates super low ?       Yes they are but this is the limit,   during the last minutes of the FOMC the topic was du jour was removing the special QE programme. Essentially, given that the   worst is behind us in the real economy, the FED WILL NOT BE MARGINALLY MORE DOVISH AND THE NEXT STEP IS A RATE HIKE CYCLE.   it might start in 22 or 23 but no later. Of course it will be priced in both rates and Bank stocks way ahead of time. in fact you can see that bonds have been selling off lately as the market digests the news around the infrastructure package and the FED speeches always make the bonds bounce but then it gets sold again :).  If you have any more questions surrounding this trade feel free to ask below, i don't feel like writing pages here cuz u are retards and never listen to me.
Help me understand MMs. Uncanny SNDL stop loss timing.
Good Morning Ladies and Gents,     I'm in SNDL at    It was trading below $2 so I thought I'd make sure I take some profits.  When it was around   I set a stop loss for $   Within 60 seconds I watched the price tumble, my order get filled, and then the price shot immediately back up.    Now that's either some WSB ape-like timing or computer programs or something controlling things.  Is this MM and if so help me understand how that's possible?  I'm wishing my shares weren't sold, ooof.
Daily reminder that buying GME at 300 before 28/1 was a great play at the time.
Yeah that’s right, I fucking said it.   I’ve noticed the FUD   has been shifting lately, It’s shifted towards calling al you retards actually retarded for buying GME at it’s height. While yeah, buying high and selling low is actually retarded, I am not disputing that.   But what I’ve noticed is that no one seems to be mentioning the fact that Robinhood (and by extension the DTC)  LITERALLY HIT THE ‘OFF’ SWITCH ON BUYS. That’s fucking right it was a great play before 28/1 even at 300 or 400. (If you bought at 300 after 28/1 you may actually be retarded)  The FUD   (or general memory loss from all the weed stonks) has made most of you forget that WE WERE FUCKING ROBBED.  Never forget that GME is not over.  Never forget that we were ROBBED of millions of dollars, not only in evaporated gains, but in actual investments with hard earned cash.  20@226$GME 26/1  Edit: DTC  Lots of people seem to be understanding this post as saying GME will go up diamond hands etc. This is not what the purpose of this post is.   The purpose of this post is to make people remember that this was not fair play.   If all you retards calling me retarded and delusional could learn to fucking read, that be great.  Edit 2:  As a response to all the arguments that it wasn’t a great play purely based on the fundamentals.  It was never about the fundamentals in the first place, it was a risky bet based on the incoming short squeeze that was purely stopped dead in it’s tracks because of the RH/DTC restrictions.

Semiconductor Plays
I'm already bought in in small amounts to $LRCX $TSM and $SWKS.  Assuming Biden goes forward with semiconductor benefits for American companies (which is looking more and more likely) what are the plays here?  I assume Lam, and Skyworks will shoot up as they're all American and $TSM will take a little dive but stay strong long term. What other bets can I make on this? Ford? GE? GM?     UPDATE: Removed $AMD and $NVDA as they are not actual manufacturers of chips
Complete DD on HYLN. No battery patent, no IP, no product. Nikola
Hyliion became a thing in the WSB world once again today.  I'll get to the once again part in a few.  I'm not going even gonna bother with tendies, wifes bf jokes, etc... because as you will see this company is more of a joke than I can make about it.  Also, I was in finance for over a decade, have passed Series 7 & 66 (since lapsed, so fuck you FINRA, I'm not an RR). So I have some clue what I'm talking about.  First, lets talk financials. Courtesy of their     Revenue: 0  PE: Divide by zero error   Profit Margin: Zilch  Operating Cash Flow:   million.   Net loss per share 2019:  , Net Loss per share 2020:   They are burning more money faster.      Intangable assets (IP aka patents fall under this) 356 thousand.  And somehow that went down from 2019's number of 429 thousand. If they had dope IP it would be worth more. Also the "new battery" isn't patented or at least mentioned here     R & D burned   million in 2020, and Admin burned   million.    Debt almost quadrupled from 2019 to 2020     Their R&D spending went up 20% and their Admin and salaries almost doubled.  They redeemed warrants at the start of the year diluting shares and raising 142 million.  This isn't generally seen as a good thing.    In October they joined with another shady looking SPAC called Tortoise that is (was?) based in the Caymans.  Cause the Caymans are never used for shady financial dealings right?    Their team is lackluster at best. The CEO is inexperienced and has an undergrad in mechanical engineering. And describes himself on the site as a serial entrepreneur, which is super cringe.  The head engineer was an engineer at Dana, which is why they have some relationship with them. Otherwise nothing of note at all.   So anyone saying 'strong team' etc, hasn't even looked at the website.            [I\       And how it became a thing on reddit once again: Almost a year ago when it launched, it hit $59/share, then dropped to $13 where it stayed.  It's already made bagholders on reddit with BS vaporware.  Don't let it do it again.   TL;DR any way you slice it.  Be it from a fundamentals perspective, IP/ Innovation perspective, or market sentiment perspective, this company is dog shit.  It's a SPAC like Nikola, and it's basically a less impressive dog and pony show without bad photoshops or theatrics.  Like they don't even care that much. There are no rockets in this post for a good fucking reason. If there was an bomb emoji it would be there, but for now I give it this. 💩   Position: Puts. I was gonna FOMO in, but I read the press release and it looked like shit, and the more I read the more I was sure it was shit. So much so I got puts.  The more I read the more I think its not just shit, but it's a total scam.    Main Takeaways: Their patent portfolio is trash, the miracle battery isn't patented, they say their IP is only worth 346k, and they dump more money on admin then they do R&D    and here is my loss porn, cause even though I still think I'm right, I didn't win, so it doesn't matter.
Warren BAffett
For those of you who were here prior to GMExplosion you might remember Warren Buffett was accumulating shares in a company last quarter which he kept secret. The last time he has done this was in 2015. By my calculations of his historic fillings, he will be releasing his 13F on Monday (deadline is Tuesday, not sure how market closed affects it) and it should reveal the company.   I've kept my ears to the ground and while there were a lot of theories, the only rumour I've heard from a reputable source was Boeing (the source being @deitaone, which publishes Bloomerg terminal updates).  Now if you put 2 and 2 together, what do you get? A good opportunity for a yolo.    Positions:    15x BA 2/19 230c  20x BA 2/19 250c  15x BA 2/26 250c   Note for the new-comers: this is a highly risky play that will probably return a loss. Don't bet your house on it.
NOK: Why I'm Still Holding (the forgotten stock)
Okay, I know the latest fabs have been weed, pharma, and GME is still rocking it, but hear me out. As an ape, I have been reading the articles on RH because I want to know what they're saying about GME, NOK, BB, and others. Turns out they started posting positive articles on NOK. Yet, NOK has been dropping like a fly below price levels from Nov 2020, even though it had an outstanding earnings report??? To top it off, it outperformed it's market competitors, yet the price continues to jump off cliffs?  Obviously it's the hedge funds being dicks. It has to be. The company is doing better than most startups because it actually has cash flow. It had   Euros in net cash flow, which is up .8B from last Q4. (1) Cash on hand has increased by   Euro from last year as well. This is by all means a relatively "safe" company to invest in, as it is stockpiling cash and generating it as well...  From my ape brain, it looks like they don't always do dividend payouts, which is weird but that's the EU for you. I don't know shit about stocks except that I was a finance major and now I do consulting because of this crap. The fundamentals don't matter when you have a bunch of rich people piss their money on Hedge fund managers trying to scrap by pretending they are the messiah. Cucks. The market is just as speculative as other currencies that shall not be named....  ALL GOODS/STOCKS/COMMODITIES ARE ONLY VALUED AT WHAT THE CONSUMER IS WILLING TO SPEND ON SAID GOOD/STOCK/ ETC.  How else do you think the stock prices go up and down like a fucking yo-yo? It's cause Fidelity and Schaub propose to buy and sell at bids and asks. It's not rocket science. All the shit they teach you in school is a fucking lie. Only small dick brains care about fundamentals. It's a rich man's game and I want to take it down by putting my money in the mouth of Nokia and other potential companies. Let's give them all hope team, hodl the line, the hedgies can't butt fuck the stock market forever.
YEAR TO DATE GAINS TODAY. I OBEYED POPPA ELON. I OUTPERFORMED QUEEN CATHIE. MY DIAMOND HANDS IS HOT BOIS. I AM KING AUTIST. Home runs on TSLA->TCNNF->PENN->PTON->JMIA. Moving some gains to div yield & defensive positions: GBTC, T, SQ, GS, MO, RIOT, AXP, TSN #JosephWarrenBuffettDirt
Hey WSB - You ARE the goddamn hedgefund!
Fuck you.   Yes you.  I wasn't bothering anyone.  I simply woke up, checked my watchlist, and decided, after 3 MONTHS - three months - of tracking APHA, Wednesday was the day to buy.   It always moved nicely.  Outpaced the sector, held firm when the sector took a hit.   It didn't seem 'flashy', or 'gambling'.  It was just little ol me, who had been enjoying 100% gains over the past 12 months, cautiously, carefully, casually buying stocks I liked and accruing them.   APHA was moving, and I astutely determined, "People are waking up that this is the right play.  Time to pounce!"  Pounce I did.   That night, I texted a buddy.  "Hey, did you see know that APHA was being discussed over in WSB?  I hope this price jump isn't because of those guys..."  Next day, c !!!!! Up 40% in 24 hours????  Boy did I time that or did I time that?  I say to you sirs:  DID I TIME THAT?  I am sitting here down more in 24 hours than I've ever been down in my life.   You guys?  You are a hedge fund.  A market manipulating hedge fund.  We end how we begin.  The omega to the alpha:  Fuck you.  Yes you.

Yesterday’s Discussion: Gang Weed loses a bit of its high, but remains on top of the table
If You're a Real  , You'll go short on $USD here's how
Step one: Take out a loan of as much money as your credit allows at today's low interest rates.  Step Two: Take your bundle of cash to Costco and buy their entire inventory of non-perishable food items  Step Three: Wait for the $USD to be hyper inflated by the Federal Reserve's 2020 shenanigans.  Step Four: Resell your beans and use the money to repay the loan. Keep the difference.  Congratulations, you're now financially stable in a crashed economy and have enough food that anyone else would mistake you for a doomsday prepper. I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice.
Screw With The Hedgefunds
Alright so we all know the subreddit is now being monitored by media, investors and hedge funds. They attempt to predict what our next play is. From what I understand alot of these people have been using software to track how many times we mention a specific stock, if we add extra stocks at the end of our posts clearly indicating thats not what we're investing in, all those people will see is that the ticker was mentioned.  EDIT: At the time of this post I didnt realize another member of this subreddit had the same idea and posted it before me. u/merlinphoto apparently had the same idea a week ago.
It is inevitable
(2/12) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News
#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-         #          > # 1. Wall Street looks to log another positive week  >     stock futures fell Friday, one day after a mixed session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average dip slightly from its previous record high close, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eked out new record high closes. All three stock benchmarks were tracking for their second straight positive week, in a continuation of February’s strength. So far this month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq increased  ,   and  , respectively. The Dow and S&P 500 broke two-month winning streaks in January, while the Nasdaq rose for a fourth month in a row in January.         > # 2. Booming Disney+ helps to offset theme park slump  >   Shares of Disney rose about 2% in premarket trading after the company reported an adjusted fiscal first-quarter profit of 32 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 41 cents per share. Revenue fell 22% to $  billion from a year earlier, though it did beat estimates. Due to Covid, Disney saw a slump in theme park attendance and box office results, but the success of its streaming video service continued. Disney+ added more than 21 million subscribers during the quarter for a total of   million.         > # 3. White House to address travel, education concerns  >   Major airline CEOs are scheduled to meet virtually Friday with the White House’s Covid-19 response coordinator to discuss travel-related issues, according to Reuters. The meeting comes as airlines, unions and industry groups strongly object to the possibility of requiring predeparture Covid testing for domestic flights. The CDC plans to issue new guidelines Friday on how to reopen   schools as safely as possible. Pressure to reopen or expand in-person learning has been building for months as students and parents tire of remote classes. Reopening schools is a top priority for the Biden administration.         > # 4.   secures 200 million more Covid vaccine doses  >   The White House secured deals for 100 million additional doses of Pfizer’s Covid vaccine and 100 million more of Moderna’s. During Thursday’s tour of the National Institutes of Health, President Joe Biden said the   will have now enough supply of the two-shot vaccines to inoculate 300 million Americans by the end of July. Biden is trying to pick up the pace of vaccinations after a slower-than-expected rollout under former President Donald Trump. Roughly   million out of some 331 million Americans have received at least their first dose of vaccine, according to the CDC.         #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(            #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(            #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(            #YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS: ######(            #TODAY'S S&P SECTORS: ######(            #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(            #NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(            #NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(            #NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(    (  THIS WEEKEND.)         #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(            #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(            #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(    (NONE.)         #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(    ######(            #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(            #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(    ######(    ######(    ######(            #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(  source:           >   Walt Disney (DIS)   – Disney reported quarterly profit of 32 cents per share, surprising analysts who had expected a loss of 41 cents per share.

SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING!
Hi, I have been lurking here for a while now. Recently I began reading WSB more, commenting, etc, because it helps numb the pain of my losses and adds some good laughs. My interest in investing in $ROPE has also decreased. I just realized that in my 7 years of "investing", I have never actually realized a profit. If my account had green, I'd always think let's enjoy some gains just for a day or two, and then it would tank as soon as I'd want to cash out a bit. This isn't even a casino at this point, I am simply just making charitable donations which are then gambled by other retards. I have even managed to lose money in real estate in Vancouver, where pretty much everyone and their wifes boyfriend has made money.   I came to the realization that this is all a game and it could not possibly be real. The game isn't rigged, its fake! This must be a simulation. As soon as I click buy, the stock tanks, if I invest in a property the market tanks, even when I pick fruits/veggies at the market they expire instantly, when I hop in the shower the water turns freezing cold. Anyone else feel like this???  If 2 retards who are experiencing this did the opposite of eachother, would one of them make money? Or would this possibly end the simulation as both aren't actually allowed to make money?  EDIT: Thanking you guys for the advice, I am staying away from the market until I learn more, even it takes years. Enjoy the soon to come record breaking market growth!  EDIT: Thank you for the Awards and Karma, I have no idea what it is but hey atleast some numbers went up for once!
I’ll never make enough own a Tesla. What I want is much more retarded. I’m just not retarded enough to do it.
I might be retarded, or deranged. Not sure yet.  A few years back real life stopped being good and I sold off my fun account to get through the hard times. There was the divorce due to my wife’s boyfriend (no joke). Then came my dog’s surgery... before the TSLA split. Tsla paid for it so I can’t complain.  My issue is that I’m consistently making boomer plays now and I can’t help myself. Last year things stopped making sense to me, and the stuff that did make sense didn’t pan out... thanks PCG. The stuff that didn’t make sense exploded. Hertz...? But, again and again, this sub called it. I just didn’t see it.  Help me make sense of what happening so I can buy my unicorn with my fun account a ride to Xanadu.  My unicorn is not a Cyber Truck. I’ll never make that kind of money.  What I want is a van. A very specific, ugly van. A van that I can get my old motorcycle into and go cross country and forget the troubles of the past few years.  The unicorn:     So, here’s my thesis...  I think people that made their GME millions in these risky plays will be looking for Boomer plays now that they are done gambling.  I also think the market, now, functions like a voting system where individual traders are investing in what they want the new world to look like, not what is exactly the best investment.  Here are my plays.  I think PCG goes to $20/ share in the expectation of a dividend in 2023. That might be in 2022... too far out. (yes... I am too boomer to understand this is not a good idea). I had a few 2023/$10 calls, but, I used the gains for a vasectomy. (Worth it)  I think STWD recovers. They’re a REIT with a 10% dividend. And they’re still down with $6 to go prior to reaching where they were prior to COVID.  SENS (handful of shares), IDEX (probably a bad idea to have shares), And a handful of penny stocks. All of these plays are up 100%.   Have a completely past the rubicon and ventured into boomer territory? Is this it - no going back? Should I just dump my little fun account into vanguard too, give up and make the safe plays? How do you risk it all for your dreams again once you get old?
$600M in inflows to UVXY in the past 4 days. Is this a big hedge or a big short position?
Sauce:    UVXY has added more than $600 million of new money in less than a week even as the volatility ETF has fallen to 1-year lows.   Short interest in UVXY has also gone to its highest level since March. This either means more people are hedging at market highs or that institutions are buying shares in order to short it.   This means that it could be either an extremely bearish signal or an extremely bullish signal. While this is about the level UVXY was at before the big correction last year, the short interest could also mean a lot of volatility is about to come off the market.   This is also a measurement of 1-month VIX futures, meaning that the bet is on the move happening over the very short term. Is anyone else playing this or using it to hedge?
WSB When They Buy Calls on Cannabis Stocks
AMD and why Sue Bae is giving me a Semi (DD)
Processing img 962rkkl28yg61...       - Advanced Mooning Devices     have gained   over the past three months. The Semiconductors industry has seen a rise of   Business is good.   The global semiconductor industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic that turned 2020 into a great year for microchip makers.    If you don't know, microchips are an important part of the auto industry, computing, digital cameras, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators and most importantly 5G systems the government is going to use to record your Google searches for 'how to buy a call option' & 'why is my pp small'?   Exiting the fourth quarter of 2020 with   of the overall x86 processor market AMD earned an adjusted 52 cents a share on sales of $  billion in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings rose 63% while sales climbed 53%.   For the current quarter, AMD expects to generate revenue of $  billion, up 79% from the year-earlier period.      Processing img 6cxhz0qm6yg61...   AMD had announced its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors in January this year, and the first laptops based on those chips have started rolling out already. So, Intel will have reasons to worry as more Ryzen 5000-based laptops hit the market.  Yes, AMD saw a huge spike in demand for its latest desktop processors that reportedly outpaced supply, forcing vendors to sell older chips. As CEO Lisa "Su Bae" pointed out on the latest   that the supply constraints were in the "low end of the PC market." AKA nothing to worry about.  So with that said it's looking likely that AMD's sequential market share loss was just a blip on the radar that has more to do with the launch timing of its latest laptop processors and a supply shortage. Both things they are working (and have been working) on rectifying in the short term. Chip foundry   Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing   (  produces AMD's chips. TSM business is killing it, with stock up \~$20 in approx. 30 day window.   Is it time to ride the lightning and buy AMD? Strong demand for AMD's products and low supply seems like a perfect mix for shares to resume their gains.

Shroom stocks - Are they really the next big thing? Specific recommendations inside
The short version: Shroom stocks have huge upside, due to their actual medical effectiveness being very high (loads of studies quoted to back it up) + ongoing approval of many psilocybin-based pharmaceutical drugs in North America + current administration making decriminalization easier. Several psychedelic mushroom stocks are backed by huge investing figures such as Peter Thiel and Kevin O'Leary. AKA              3 parts to this DD:  1. The science - why psychedelic mushrooms have huge potential as medicinal products. 2. The rise of mushrooms and psilocybin as pharmaceutical drugs 3. Specific stock recommendations and my positions    My core thesis:   Psychedelic mushrooms have a lot of scientific evidence backing their beneficial effects for specific conditions. This means that eventually, psilocybin-based drugs are bound to get approved, which will drive the entire psychedelic sector up.    1 - THE SCIENCE - WHY THEY HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS    The evidence behind the effectiveness of psychedelics for various health conditions is piling up.  Harvard University: "the study authors and the commentators — who include Charles Schuster, former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; Nobel Prize winner Solomon Snyder; and nationally known addiction expert Herbert Kleber — recommend revived investigation of the therapeutic and scientific uses of hallucinogens" -    Pharmacognosy Review: "They are also one of the richest source of anticancer and immunomodulating agents. Thus these novel myochemicals from these mushrooms are the wave of future." -    3 Biotech Journal: "This will further help the researchers to understand the metabolites and find other metabolites as well from the mushrooms which can be used for the potential development of the drugs to treat various life-threatening diseases." -    DEPRESSION: psilocybin therapy for a startup was given “breakthrough therapy” designation (a review fast track) by the FDA for the treatment of depression (more on this later).  Psilocybin therapy can help smokers abstain from smoking, according to a small pilot study:    Another open label study found that it can reduce heavy drinking:    A randomized, double-blind trial from Johns Hopkins in 2016 found that one single dose of psilocybin drastically improved quality of life and decreased depression and anxiety in people suffering from life-threatening cancer diagnoses:    SUMMARY: There is a huge amount of scientific evidence showing the potential of psilocybin against depression, heavy smoking and drinking, to improve quality of life in cancer patients, and as an anti-cancer agent. This medical evidence is not well known and relatively hard to find and analyze, making it an opportunity for the entire psilocybin sector.    2 - THE RISE OF PSILOCYBIN DRUGS + SLOW DECRIMINALIZATION    Psilocybin is slowly decriminalized in the US - Denver, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have legalized its use not long ago. Lawmakers in Ann Arbor, Michigan voted to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and it's been legalized for therapeutic use in the entire state of Oregon.  I'm NOT claiming that full decriminalization is coming anytime soon. However, the Biden administration SHOULD in theory make at least partial decriminalization a real possibility.  However, my main argument is that it doesn't have to be legal on a major scale at all to explode. The real, major trend is the use and approval of psilocybin in pharmaceuticals.  Whenever a new field get such high amount of scientific studies proving its potential (see above), it's inevitable that startups and firms will try to create patented drugs to benefit from it.  And governments are starting to realize that targeted use of psilocybin for specific health conditions can be very beneficial. Which means that this opportunity is becoming more and more real and interesting for biotech companies.  According to  . Three more exemptions quickly followed, perhaps a harbinger of restrictions being eased."  In other words, various psilocybin-based drugs are being approved as we speak, all over North America. As we've seen with marijuana, Canada is usually a trend-setter - and approval of psilocybin pharmaceuticals in Canada is likely to lead to the same outcome in the USA.  As a matter of fact, it's already happening in the US. Like I said earlier, the startup Compass Pathways's new psilocybin treatment received "breakthrough therapy" status - essentially giving it a fast track to FDA approval.  This would have NEVER been possible under the previous administration, and is a sign of things to come.  SUMMARY: The current administration makes decriminalization of mushrooms more likely. However, even if full decriminalization is light years away, the FDA approval of psilocybin-based drugs and the same phenomenon in Canada is driving the entire sector way up. Again, this is due to the fact that mushrooms ACTUALLY WORK for a wide range of health conditions.    3 - SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY POSITIONS    Now, with all this in mind - if the entire mushroom sector is bound to explode, which stock do I recommend?  1. Compass Pathways ($CMPS) - No need for a huge explanation here. CMPS is the company whose drug received breakthrough therapy designation. This makes FDA approval significantly more likely. Probably the leading mushroom stock. Oh - and the stock is backed by Peter Thiel, too. 2. Mind Medicine ($MMEDF) - Kevin O'Leary invested in the pre-IPO round of $24 million. They're currently running clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of LSD for anxiety and headaches. The company focuses on psychedelic-oriented therapies for anxiety, addiction and ADHD - which are probably the most promising areas of research at the moment. Probably has the biggest upside potential.  There are obviously other stocks, but I've vetted this stock for management integrity (extremely important in a sector like psychedelics) and long-term commercial viability.  My position:    100 shares of $CMPS @ $50   1200 shares of $MMEDF @ $   Usual disclaimers: There's no guarantee of anything ever, and most morons who invest end up losing money. Sorry pal.

Why "Cheap" Asian Company ADRs Are (Almost 100%) Value Traps
Hey Kimchi here with a quick message:  Am seeing a ton of Asian ADRs being shilled on here with the message being that they're cheap. Yes they are cheap, but there's a reason.     Shitty Corporate Governance:     I'm not completely familiar with Chinese and Japanese conglomerates (but have heard they're similar) so I'm going to focus on the Korean ones. Korean companies essentially exist for the benefit of the founder's families. Period.  People went off about corporate governance issues at Facebook and Snapchat during their IPOs due to founders controlling the company with "only" 22% and 36% ownership respectively... Samsung's "owner" controls the entire conglomerate with a   ownership stake.        Circular Holdings:     A Korean company having a holding in another subsidiary isn't a good thing. It's a way for the founder to hold on to as much control of as many companies as possible with as little capital as possible.  The founder will have a stake in company A -> Company A has a stake in company B -> Has a stake in Company C -> Has a stake in Company A.     Prices Held Down:     Unlike the US where CEOs have bonus incentives to keep stock prices up (a different issue in and of itself), founders/CEOs in Korea have incentives to keep the price down. They want to keep the price as cheap as possible so that when they die the inheritance taxes are lower for their children. Seriously. Stock prices at these conglomerates go up when one generation of owners die as they're no longer held down.  The shit that these founders pull on shareholders make hedgefunds/wallstreet guys in the US look like saints. Nearly every founder of every major conglomerate in Korea has gone to jail for securities fraud/embezzlement/bribery. It's a shitshow.    tl;dr:    Don't mess with Korean stocks (or Chinese, Japanese, etc) if the only reason is "they're cheap". They're cheap for a reason and they will be for a long time.
BB/AMZN Speculation Part 2: Forget cars. It's was all about the drones from the start.
In case you missed it:   of my speculation on why I think BB/AMZN are not-so-secretly working together on drones.   TLDR: AWS's CEO will become Amazon's CEO, and together with JC he will make Futurama-esque air traffic a reality in the near future via AWS IOT and QNX/IVY.  Okay first things first. To dispel the notion that "bLacKbErRy QnX iS foR caRS And iT haS notHinG to Do wITH DronES" see:   Literally the very first image on that page is a drone. QNX isn't just for cars. It's for all things autonomous including cars, trucks, evtols, drones, minority report spider bots, you name it.  Secondly, with regards to those who claim that "Amazon can just program their own drones" and thus has no need for BlackBerry, I implore you to check out BB's trove of Government certifications (link  .   With that out of the way, let's talk D-R-O-N-E-S  Here are a few more supporting evidence for my hypothesis:  December 2013 - Bezos reveals Amazon Prime Air, a R&D project to deliver parcels with "octocopters" He suggested it would be \~5 years or so before it is available to consumers.   Well, it's been 7 years now so we are already 2+ years behind schedule.  December 18, 2015 - Amazon file for patents pertaining to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (LINK at bottom)  December 18, 2015 - AWS IOT (Internet of Things) launches    >"We built IoT Core because connected devices are proliferating. They are in your house, your car, your office, your school, and perhaps even in your body! Like some of our more advanced customers, we have been building systems around connected devices for quite some time.   Our experience with     has given us a well-informed perspective on how to serve this really important emerging market"  Is it reaching to suggest that Amazon very much had DRONES on their minds when they started AWS IOT on the same day the filed for UAV patents? Take a look at this   to get an idea of what Amazon had in mind.  Fast forward to 2020  In Jan 2020, AWS announced a collaboration with BlackBerry:  >"The platform will integrate the BlackBerry QNX operating system and over-the-air software update services, with   AWS IoT   cloud services for secure connectivity and telematics, Amazon SageMaker for developing ML models, and   AWS IoT   edge services for in-vehicle ML inference."  Alright, so the purpose of this partnership is "secure connectivity", "telematics (monitoring of vehicle)" and "ML (machine learning)".. nothing that specifically points to drones yet  In June 2020, BlackBerry partners with DeDrone (a leader in airspace security):  >"New advanced technologies have the potential to solve some of today’s most pressing challenges, however, they also introduce new security risks,” said Christoph Erdmann, Senior Vice President of Secure Communications, BlackBerry. “  Drones are one of the many IoT endpoints that add to the growing chaos that security leaders must navigate.   We’re excited to partner with Dedrone to offer a critical solution that organizations around the world can use to keep citizens and the public safe.”  Drones. Security. IoT. 5 months after Amazon and BlackBerry began their collaboration.  In September 2020, Amazon Drone Fleet receives FAA approval. Did BB have anything to do with it? Maybe, maybe not.  Alright, so let's pretend that you subscribe to this hypothesis that BB had a hand in Amazon's drone project. So what? BFD, right? How many drones are we even talking about? 20000? 50000?  Amazon delivers \~3 billion packages a year globally. Drones are by far the cheapest option for last mile delivery (contrast that with a dude wear khaki shorts driving a 2 ton truck from the Amazon fulfillment center to your condo) so it's no stretch to suggest that it will be Amazon's preferred method of delivery like 99%+ of the time. No, a drone isn't going to fly all the way from Seattle, Washington to your porch in Blaine.. but an autonomous truck might take your parcel from Seattle to Blaine and let a drone complete the rest of the journey. Or something.   3 billion deliveries divided by 365  =   million deliveries per day. Even if drones can deliver packages to you in 30 minutes on average (60 min round trip) and worked around the clock with no need for recharging or maintenance, it would take 342465 drones. That's 342465 unmanned flying vehicles collecting flight data for IVY.   I'm gonna stop myself here before this completely devolves into JC/Jassy fan fiction. The whole point of this coke bender DD is to suggest that BB's potential isn't merely "OS for Cars." In fact, cars only account for 175 million out of Blackberry's 500 million IOT endpoints.   We're talking about drones, flying taxis, robots, roombas, fighter jets, tanks, and yes, EVs too. Essentially, anything that MOVES and CAN POTENTIALLY BE HACKED = $$$ for BB. I wager that there will be plenty of things in the future which fall into both of those categories.  Position: a modest amount of BB shares.  LINKS:
Can you guys stop making posts giving advice on why to sell or why not to sell?
I understand that some people are feeling bad for new users losing all of their money and feel the need to fucking absolutely flood the sub with posts either explaining how not to “end up as a bag holder” or “why not to exit your positions yet” but jesus fucking christ it only makes things worse. All of these new friends that just joined do not give a SINGLE fuck about the context of your post. When they see a ticker in the title or body of your post, followed up with 50k upvotes, they’re just gonna buy the stock. This shit is wildly annoying. The weed stocks could have been so much better than they ended up if it wasn’t for that shit.  Edit for the new friends: if you see a stock on here get popular, that means you are going to lose money on it.
SKM undervalued. I like the stock
This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too.        TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at   Shares should be 40$ to reflect that. Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.  SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap. Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.  Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.  Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis         Risk and catalyst: Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted. Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.  Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly   Billion usd. The entire market cap for SKM listed shows   usd.  It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only   it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.  10B +   =   I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.  Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted.         Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening.  Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)  I like this stock because it's undervalued.         Edit:Jun 25c and 30c Will post proof in morning
We're being shutdown...
News:     TL;DR   According to the Journal, Reddit is under investigation by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as well for its part in  possible misconduct with traders at the subreddit  r/WallStreetBets  who  spurred the buying spree of GameStop along with other "meme" stocks.  Congress is already      about the events. Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, told  Cheddar on Feb. 3 that her committee would hear from Reddit, GameStop,  Robinhood and others involved.
Get the rockets ready for Inovio! PT of $35, but worth so much more!
"Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh initiated coverage of Inovio Pharmaceuticals with an Outperform rating and $35 price target. The stock in after-hours trading is up 6%, or 80c, to $  Inovio's COVID-19 vaccine has a "differentiated profile and is moving closer to the finish line," Singh tells investors in a research note titled "A DNA Medicines Disruptor Gaining Steam." The company also has a "unique cancer vaccine with intriguing early-stage efficacy" in glioblastoma, adds the analyst. Singh says that while COVID-19-focused INO-4800 has been the high-profile candidate, Inovio's overall DNA platform "should not be overlooked." The analyst is bullish on the company's approach. INO-4800 has a better safety and tolerability profile that could generate higher uptake in a low-risk population, easier storage favored by stockpile, and potential flexibility to adjust for mutations, Singh contends."
Enough with the Apes
This Ape thing needs to stop, it’s not funny, it’s not a meme, it’s annoying and disrespectful to Apes. At least an ape has 1 maybe 2 folds unlike the average smooth inside out Mr Clean heads that roamed free two months ago.  The time I spent lurking this sub before considering even asking a question was not wasted, to all the new people, this isn’t the first day of school and you don’t get to make the rules. Shut the fuck up, read stuff and stop embarrassing yourself, you’re in the lime light now.
I Think I Found A Way To Predict Dips with NASDAQ PSX and FINRA Volume, Or Maybe I Really Am Autistic
\- Go Nuts Everyone!     Last night I looked into SNDL and started comparing activities across the various markets that I could find, two for NASDAQ and FINRA's off-exchanges volumes. I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they're not.  No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.  Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!     Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.     Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say "OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE" but I noticed something from another "penny stock" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.     Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!  So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day   IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together   towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%       TLDR:      Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!   If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.   IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow, MAYBE    Edit 1:   Added the links to where you can find the volume txt files, but I've been having issues with the FINRA site, have to clear the browser sometimes or it takes you to a login screen.          Edit 2:   Was asked to see how my "theory" checks out with today's dip in TLRY:          Edit 3:    BoatyMcBoatFace -4:30am 16% !!! 5am -13%, 9am -20%, 9:25am -13%,   10:30am -18%, Noon - 15%, 1pm - 15%, 2:45pm - 14%      Edit 4:   WELP.... -15%, I guessed 20% above, then 3 lines down I said 30%. Now gotta wait till 6pm to get FINRA numbers to see what the 3 volumes looked like.    Edit 5:   FINAL EDIT, with all the market volumes falling. No idea what it means when they all dip still fairly tight like that, need to go through more data.
BETS BEING PAID- A list of unpaid bets (it's about time)
Remember the guy who   because he said SPY wouldn't close green that day? THAT is the WSBets-level of ARRtism that I crave seeing every time I come here- the loss and gain porn is okay but I want to see more ridiculous wagers being paid, don't you?

LOL  u/sc00ba_steve owes a rocket emoji tattoo, another "$ "-er.  u/EzClapsFN said $100 and owes a GeeEmEe tattoo.  Congrats to u/raymofwuk on his geeEmEe/WSB  , he said he'd get it if Gee eM Eee hit $200 a share- he literally bet his ass! Way to go!   This is a casino, and bets need to be paid. These assholes pretend-betting are ruining the essence of WSBets.  EDIT   Donate to   instead of awards.   Holding people to their word (and banning those who don't keep their word) is the sure way to weed out imposters and keep the community going.

Virgin Galactic V Day Fantasy ($SPCE)
#   Imagine:     It's Sunday. You get all spiffed up in your Sunday best; your valentine is on her way over.   You spend the day playing Cyberpunk 2077 on the PS5 you bought from GameStop because you pulled out at $400 with a 470% profit.   She's feeding you chocolate turtles and cheering you on. It's almost dinner time now.  It's rocket shaped chicken tendies with the home made dippy sauce.    You finish your meal, and start heading up to the bedroom for the night cap.   As you walk into a candlelit bedroom with VG logo rose pedals scattered about, you get a twitter notification:     "(@virgingalactic): We are happy to announce that our SpaceShipTwo Unity test flight went smoothly and without error. Our pilots are now safely on the ground and we are preparing for our next flight carrying our founder, Richard Branson."   You proceed to blow the biggest v-day load in history knowing Tuesday is going to be the biggest, wettest, hardest, rocket ship of a green dildo you have ever seen in your life.

A Day in the Life
You look at your favorite new subreddit. Your taint tingles looking for new stocks that other mouth frothing apes have discovered to invest in. Boomer stock? Too pedestrian. Commodities? Too boring.  You look deeper into a post with 2 upvotes and one line of DD with the only comment saying "IM IN" you start to vibrate.  You frantically go to your app to invest in this newfound stock. Your entire being starts to shake.    You put your entire life savings of $  into options of this brilliant stock that will go to alpha centauri and take you to other galaxies and universes even.

Feeling bad for new members - some advice
Listen I’ll be honest with you all. I’ve been on this sub for 3 years. Multiple people come and go but most importantly few survive most leave after their first big loss.   Few lessons: 1) At the end of the day it’s every man for himself in the markets. No one is going to care for you if you go broke we are not privileged like Melvin.   2) Down a lot on a stock? The question is would you buy more of that stock at that price. If the answer is yes hold, if no sell.     find a stock that you think will perform better than your current investments? Sell a position and diversify  3) Recognise when a stock is dead. If everyone says it’s going up. It’s reached the top.   4) Diversify retard. At the end of the day long-term options and shares are the best bet. Not fucking OTM weekly FDs Not financial advice just sharing my opinion.   PS: u/MartyMoho made a post that auto moderator removed for my OG boys. He’s not dead. THE LEGEND LIVES

CLDR easy move to 20$ and up in couple of days.
If you don't look for Shares with 15-20% moves in couple of days, ignore this. But if you are a believer of the philosophy that whatever hikes steady, stays steady, please go ahead.    Historically CLDR nicely follows the SR levels of a parallel channel. Look at the chart below in between a period of Jul 2019 to Feb 2020.        It is forming two channels. And both the channels were followed throughout.    What is the current situation          It has broken out of the larger channel created out since March last year and is trying to retest the last S/R level it brokeout from.        If it holds the level of   or reclaims it soon enough if broken I am certain that we are looking at 20$ and a new ATH soon.  Let me know if you see something contradictory.
To all the tide pod eaters and YOLO investors. APE STRoNG. Some advice...
Some of you guys or whatnots have some cash to toss around for gambles.   But look here. This subreddit was for guys who bet against certain markets and post their gains or loss. What we have now is a fuckwad of retards who think they can get rich quick by pump and dump.  Here's the thing. Since the gme fiasco wsb has drawn a lot of attention from the hedge funds. So any time you tares talk about the next big push on a stock, the professionals are watching and will play you.   Most of us that were originally part of this group used the forum as a means for learning and laughs.  Now it has become a zoo.  Many of us want to make some gains through good investments with a bit of gambles. But you fuckwads that have infested this subreddit have now drawn the attention of the major players in the market and want to take all the money you have.  Get out now,  this pump and dump scheme won't last long and you tards will find out the hard way that the house always wins.  You may have made a little money watching the market all day, but us real investors and real workers, don't have all day to look at a screen.  This fuckwad mob mentality is fucking up the market and other people's investments and livelihood. Stop trying to pump and dump. The HF can see and track your dimbasses before you can do anything about it.  If you want to continue this, fine I hope all you tide pod eaters lose all your equity and get fucked.
Where are EV stocks headed?
So, Toyota is valued around $200 billion, VW $100 Billion, GM $76 Billion, Daimler $84 Billion  Those are all "traditional" auto companies, and the average is $115 Billion  Tesla is at almost $800 Billion, NIO is at around $100 Billion despite being much smaller than even Tesla.  My question is, when the dust settles, which won't be for at least a decade if not more, are EV companies going to be valued on average higher than traditional car companies are valued today? Will it depend on whether or not they also have a battery/energy play like Tesla?  Just wondering, is NIO overvalued, or does it represent where the market thinks EV companies should be valued?
Never buy the stocks that the people on CNBC tell you to buy
This should be common sense: DO NOT BUY THE STOCKS THAT THE PEOPLE ON CNBC TELL YOU TO BUY. It's either a pump and dump or the stock's already up like 20 percent by the point that you can buy. It always crashes. I'd actually go a step further and say that you should sell your stock if the people on CNBC tell you to buy it. If they tell you to buy weed stocks, wait until the prices inevitably fall to buy it. If they tell you to sell stocks, then that's when you gotta buy.
5 Stages of Grief with $AMC
I purchased AMC at 16$. Here are the 5 stages of grief.      1. Denial - There's absolutely no way this stock will not squeeze! The short squeeze is coming, it's just as matter of time. It's happening, and I will not accept no for an answer.      2. Anger - These POS Hedgefund bullies, forever taking our piece of the pie. Where's the fairness in all of this? Where is God? Why is this happening?    3. Barganining -  What if AMC become digital? What if AMC is purchased by Amazon or Netflix? Errr post pandemic we will see movie theatres open again and it will rise, everyone loves the cinema.   LaDdEr aTacKS     4. Depression - Is there any point to this any more? I feel robbed and all I want to do is sleep. Everytime I look at the charts I feel like crying myself to sleep whilst eating chocolate.     5. Acceptance - I'm ok with this, I'm a doofus. I joined a hype train, made a huge mistake. I will learn from this and just HOLD until I can make my money back or take a 30% loss. Whatever, it is what it is.      Hey you retards, jokes aside. If you are struggling with grief or have recently lost somebody.
Why Yandex (YNDX) is poised for optimal growth and massive expansion
I'm going to cut to the chase because I know most of you are on the verge of bankruptcy at age 19 because you got in at $450 on GME and wondering why its not going to $1000 after you paper handed at $439 and sold.     # What is Yandex?  Yandex is a multinational corporation that operates primarily in Russia, Europe and ex-Soviet bloc offering a wide range of services. Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine, taxi services and other segments. Currently they offer more than 70 services (Streaming subscriptions like Netflix,   like Spotify, Classifieds ads, self-managed subscriptions for ad  , self driving cars, deliveries, marketplace and a fuck ton more)     # But first, fundamentals.  This is to help you sleep better at night so you can worry more about your 35c 2/19 AMC calls you blew your money into.  I don't like re-inventing a lot of stuff so this is simply principles I've adopted from Grand-Daddy Graham    Adequate size (sales no less than 700m)          As you can see Yandex has been seeing consistent revenue growth since 2017. Recently, its delivery service has begun turning a profit and is widely used among the citizens of Russia.  Read that again.   A Taxi/food delivery service is turning a profit.   That is a big accomplishment. Have you seen Uber or DoorDash turn a profit?           Check the 2018 & 2019 numbers. Now, do you want to know something else?   They currently have enough cash ( $) to cover all their current total liabilities or all their convertible (one or the other) at any time they need.    In addition, they've repeated in their financial statements that the liquid cash they have   is enough to cover operating costs should the pandemic continue.    This tells me they're not gonna lay down like a bitch and cry to daddy when a white swan curve ball is thrown at them (I'm looking at you airlines)              Uninterrupted Dividend payments in previous 20 years  No dividends paid ever.

You always want to see a positive cash flow to ensure that companies have enough liquidity to stay afloat and keep them from issuing new shares to raise capital. Spikes in cash flow from growth companies is not uncommon, it is mainly due to usual acquisitions, restructuring, re-investments made. Current outstanding shares: \~345m  # Now, on to some of their services.  This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend. (Don't yo, this is a long term play)         1. Grocery delivery within 5-12 min is the goal. Some sites are achieving this already 2. Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s. Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process. 3. Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery (think Amazon Prime Now) 4. In order to reduce costs, additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built. 5. Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked 6. Yandex Rover is making deliveries (actively) in three different locations. Currently a test but with the goal of going 100% driverless for deliveries and reduce costs.            1. Their current primary growth segment. They've recently acquired Sberbank's stake (Russia's most influential and one of largest banks) and now own 100% of market. Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as   2. They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones. Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer (cliche, but think Amazon)            1. Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers (stuff ranging from documents to pianos) 2. More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders 3. "Delivery with a click" which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas (think Amazon locker). Delivery goals are to be within 15 min.            Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies. Main competition Amazon AWS         Same as above. Main competitor Google Maps    Alice    Yandex's dedicated AI. Currently has 45+m users, mainly in speakers, navigation, Yandex App         Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues.  1. What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that   while search engine revenues kept increasing, their TAC (traffic acquisition costs, the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them) is decreasing.   What does this mean? It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium.   Think  , why the fuck unless you're a boomer would you go to google, search for 'amazon' when you can go to amazon directly? This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads. 2. TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16% while total ad revenues grew by 1%. Read that again god damn it.   They're paying 16% less while maintaining their ad revenues, their biggest segment!      Yandex Self Driving Group    Yo. This shit. Is. Legit.  Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow. Dirt, snow, murky (or none at all) traffic lanes, chaotic drivers, alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another   hit on his portfolio. And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input.  They currently have logged over   million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv, Michigan and Moscow. That is a big fucking deal. They also have a partnership with Hyundai.    However  , coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving. This means it will take several years for perfection, whos to say sales cant happen before that?  # Other stuff  They sponsor educational   and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia (Physics, mathematics, engineering) and they continue to choose talent from these areas. This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US/Europe to develop their products  They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience. I am telling you, Russians (especially those born in Soviet era) is TOUGH to accept technology. And yet they've done it by   and   .  I'm kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now, I feel like we're running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks.  Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020. Don't ever take this as a tell-tale sign to buy, but rather as one part to consider        # Gay Bear cases (in this case I am also a gay bear)  Russia is not stable politically - things can be done under the table.    True, fair risk. But more or less the same thing in US except it's official (lobbying, insider trading, congress hearings that are just a facade)  They're too over-extended in their segments. They're focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well.    I would be concerned about this if their cash flow, revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY. However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing. Also, think about it more simply - if they have these specialists working on all these segments, they can easily sell them off for a profit.   was a cashless payment system that was 100% sold off to Sberbank. It is something that Yandex created and then re-invested those proceedings to their different ventures like    What else you got? I am legitimately interested as my overconfident ass has 50% of his portfolio in this.  Current positions  20k in shares, 4k in calls.  This is not a short term play. Play at your own risk boys & girls this isn't advice but some DD thatll probably get buried by the 10,000 GME/AMC posts.
Mods, can we take this place back to its roots?
The amount of people I see advocating buying shares and holding them for six months plus is fucking absurd.   /r/investing <-- is that way you risk averse ~~adverse~~ fucks.   Don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for shares, or even,  gasp  shares in a major index ETF.   It's called your retirement account, and it's the last thing you should be trading with at fucking /r/wallstreetbets.  Shares aren't the way here. What happened to the 10 delta yolos on contracts expiring end of week, or even end of day lmao.   Our lossporn is gonna be weak as fuck if we don't cut this shit out.   This is a casino inside a Wendys, not your local branch office of Berkshire Hathaway.  Edit: for all you degens asking for positions.  SPY 408/424c leaps /CL 60/63c on the March contract. Oil is coming back for me today. I opened down 2k. Maybe not as retarded a play as I thought.
Some important advice for my fellow Canadian investors.
Maybe it was just me who didn't know this but put your investments/stocks  into a RRSP or TFSA account immediately if you haven't already. If you  currently just use a margin account, 50% of any gain you sell is taxed!!  In a RRSP or TFSA it is not taxed. And with a TFSA, any withdrawals you  make are not taxed at all! Where as with a RRSP they are. I only just  learned this and would have been pissed to find out if i sold my  shares I'd be paying tax on 50% of my gains so this is for newbies like myself  who didn't know.  Edit: My understanding of the gains tax was wrong but is now corrected.
To all my Peak Freak Apes - there is one major reason to not let out of your SNDL position just yet
So the market corrected today. There has been a ton of press in the last 72 hours about how Sundial is an inflated stock and that no doubt had an effect on the market today. That, and, if we are being frank, the stock was probably a bit overvalued given the lack of DD that actually caused it rise.  But let's pause right there and take a minute to discuss value. Value, some may argue, is only held intrinsically. However, the reality is that value is always set by the buyer. The market is driven by market psychology. The point here is that no matter what reason SNDL gained over the last two weeks, the value was there. For those of us who bought and and have gains, and those of us who bought and are holding the bag right now -- the fact of the matter is for a period of time the value of this stock had increased. We ourselves saw the higher value in it, otherwise we wouldn't have bought it at the price we did, now would we have? Whether a rise in value is due to the company experiencing a catalyzing event, or because a bunch of retarded apes like flinging their own shit around, it doesn't really matter - the value went up.  Now, I only paused for that brief aside because I want to tell my fellow apes - stop being peak freaks. A day of correction isn't the end of the world. The fact of the matter is, this stock may have been overvalued at $4, but at under a dollar it was drastically undervalued given the "money moves" they have been making in the last 10 months.  Now, segue into the point of all this. Due to the rise in value over the last 9 days of SNDL, regardless of what caused that rise, SNDL has made it into the territory of becoming compliant. 9 consecutive days of over $1 and tomorrow is day 10. What does this mean? It means the stock, having been in jeopardy of being delisted from Nasdaq ever since it transferred to the exchange, lost investor interest. Now, with a 10 day consecutive period trading over $1, the stock will be no longer be in jeopardy of being delisted (at least for 90 more days). The Big takeaway here is this: SINCE $SNDL WAS LISTED ON NASDAQ, IT HAS \ NEVER\  REACHED THIS COMPLIANCE THRESHOLD. Since day 1 it has literally been fighting to stay on NASDAQ. Now, in all likelihood, it is going to get to stay. This will likely serve as a catalyst event to boost the stock short term.  I am not saying this stock is destined to go back to $4, but if you are down today and want to let your shares grow and then go for the profit take, the opportunity has not disappeared.     TL;DR $SNDL gets NASDAQ compliance tomorrow and then we should anticipate a bump of some sort in the price due to the new-founded exposure.  Also, I have an IQ of 60.
WSB, listen up. YOLO on a stock you like:
Has anyone else noticed that newbies will come, massively pump up a stock, and it rises by 1000%+ only to plummet immediately after?   Yeah, it’s a pattern. Raise stocks for about 5+ days. They open massively higher than they stay during the day (good for hedgies, who are making it look like there’s huge interest, or they’re selling on those artificial highs dumdums create by after hours trading without setting a price limit.   The last FOUR stocks I’ve been tracking from DD here (thank goodness I didn’t buy) have been massively inflated in ~5 days, and now they have all announced that they leveraged the new higher stock price to offer millions of stocks to investors at prices 100x what the stock was valued at just a week or two ago.    Now, since there is a massive influx of stocks flooding the market, the price falls dramatically. Just watch. All the stocks being pushed here this past week are about to absolutely tank, and soon- sooner than you can get out from under it.
Is an agriculture monopoly making the John Deere stock go to the moon?
Source:    Basically in the article is says there is a monopoly of a few players (Bayer, Corteva, ChemChina and BASF) controlling the entire agriculture sector and they decide for the farmers what tractor they should buy and they dictate the farmers what to grow and how. Supply chains are also very short and that means things could break very quickly, is this why we also see mass farmer protests around the world? I wonder about this because I see that stock price only going up and I am not sure why it does.  I could be wrong, then please let me know in the comments?

WeedStocks Destroyer Of Wealth
Weed stocks historically have been destroyer of wealth. I am sick and tired of people saying weed stocks are a long term play, buy and hold in weed stocks especially the ones like SNDL will take your portfolio down to 99% in couple of months.   Even CGC has been down more than 60 percent from it's top before the pandemic even began.  If you cannot hold this stock and diamond hand's it for more than 6+ months then GTFO.  APHA holders who bought before pre legalization and never averaged down just went positive only for 1-2 days this week. They    it for 3+ years.  For example take a look at this post.  , this post is found in r/weedstocks  when you sort it by top by all time. The user predicted a Stock Price to be 80+ in 2021 and current stock price is .017 cents. The post was created in when stock price was around $  USD.  The only time people made money was during the runup of Canada Legalization. After Oct 2018 this was sell the news event and stocks started dropping.  Since OCT  2018 - March 2020 Majority of the Favorite Weed Stocks had plummeted to  10-20 cents.  Lot's of discord and slack pump and dump group's are involved where the runup a stock and then drop the price. These people do the charts in youtube.  If you are a normal investor who cannot spend the entire day day trading then you will loose your life savings.  Lets take a look at some popular weedstocks and how they are doing currently from 2018-2020.  M E D M E N it went from $6 to 10-20 cents in the above time frame.  I A N T H U F went from $6 to 10-30 cents in the above time frame.  CANTRUST\_OR\_CANT TRUST US basically did fraud, after a whistle blower complained about  it the stock price went from $10 - 50 cents  charlotte web went from high $20 to $3.  Acreage Holding went from high $30 to $  and bounced back.  I am not listing the absolute worst stocks from 2018/2019 time frame I am listing the ones that were very popular in r/weedstocks.  Even the ones with good earnings and management like TRUl, GTII, CRESCO, CURA and others went down to $2-$5 in march.  This is a highly speculative industry where the stocks are highly manipulated by day traders and others.  Weedstocks have destroyed more people lives in 3 years than WSB have destroyed in 8 years.  EDIT : For people complaining I have listed some of trashiest companies, please remember these were the most hyped up stock for more than 18 months in a sub reddit dedicated to weed stocks.  Most of these stock were already falling pre pandemic.  If you started invested any time after April of 2020 and think you are genius then all you need is one    month to lose all. This post is just a warning of things that can happen.
Went balls deep on TLRY/APHA FDs yesterday. Not my finest moment
Meme Stock Cycle
I've noticed newer people aren't sure how this works. I told someone yesterday that SNDL would dump today or Friday and they asked me "what my thesis was". There is no thesis. You nerds can't just go by numbers or info about the company. This is human behavior and computer algos programmed by humans.  So let me lay out what happened with SNDL (and most meme stocks for that matter)  Early Adopter Phase - This was when SNDL was under $  recently. People who suspect the stock is undervalued and a lot of bigger money investors are loading up. The stock may trade relatively flat or go through small increases.  Middle Phase - 01/28: SNDL spikes up to 100%, before closing the day up about 39% at $  Very high volume on the day. This is where people who are watching for activity get in (I bought here).  Late/FOMO Phase - 02/08: SNDL spikes roughly 14% and goes into a stage of parabolic gains as retail buyers rush in and FOMO takes hold. Word spreads like wildfire across social media and forums. Everybody is aware at this point.  \ Short sellers know how this works as well and they will enter positions at some point during this phase  Profit Taking Phase - After a few days of huge gains on very high volume, buying reaches a crescendo. The earliest adopters have already made several times their initial investment and are ready to cash out. The people who bought in the middle know that the "smart money" has either already sold or is about to sell. This leads to chain reaction of increased selling. Fear can take hold over the Late Adopters as they do not want to lose money and panic sell.  Set for next cycle - The stock usually drills hard, followed by some more selling and/or a dead cat bounce if the drop is too drastic. Over the next trading sessions, price will go through smaller up an down bounces until a new "baseline price" is found. The stock will usually trade sideways for a bit until the cycle begins anew. (This last part is hard to predict). Stocks may see very little activity for weeks or months in this phase, or buyers may quickly regain interest, especially if a catalyst appears.  This isn't WSB doing this or the media or whatever grand conspiracy you think it is. It's happened many times and will continue to happen    Edit  : Decided to scoop up some APHA, TLRY, and SNDL from the panic sellers during premarket. There's no "set" way to determine it, but I felt that all of these got "oversold" by the panic sellers. Retail usually buys high and sells low, be different.
The next EV run - $FSR $27 PT from Morgan Stanley to trigger Wyckoff run to the moon
This stock ran to $23 in November off a $26 pt from credit suisse. A couple $15-16 targets sent this into a long accumulation range that its finally ready to break out of. Apparently big banks and institutions manipulate the price over a period of time to shake our retail investors while accumulating at a price they like without raising it too much with big single purchases      Henrik Fisker owns patents on solid state battery tech and teased class leading range in a call at the Goldman Sachs conference today     Magna is their manufacturing partner and owns a 6% stake as part of the deal     Up almost 9% in after hours after the PT came out   This is set to run tomorrow, hop on and catch your moon ticket
Death and   $SCI to the moon   🪦
TLDR:   $SCI is the industry leader for cemeteries, funerals, and cremation services. Deaths have increased this year dramatically. Load up. Earnings report on 2/15. TOMORROW is your day to trade this.  Link with full research/photos here since automods are a pain in the ass:     Written portion below, but link above is honestly your best bet for getting all the information on this trade.  Death & Taxes   I am not a financial advisor. Do not take this as investment advice. This is solely my opinion     Date    02/08/2021     Trade    SCI ER on 2/15; 3/19 Options Calls; Long Equity     Ticker    $      Thesis  “Funeral Home” & “funeral home near me” are trending & $SCI is the largest provider of funeral, cremation, and cemetery services.  Based on the Q4 Covid deaths and also an aging Boomer population, $SCI is well positioned for consistent growth for years to come. They are also poised for an excellent earnings report on Monday, 2/15… Load up soon or you’ll be left in the dust.  The search trends for funeral home are at all time highs on the 5 year chart. I will also provide a few snapshots from the earnings transcript where the SCI team is discussing the increased interest in Preneed cemetery plots. If you’re unfamiliar with this, it’s basically buying a cemetery plot before you need one. They’re typically financed over a 5 year term, but the revenue is instantly recognized.  The SCI team also pointed out on their last earnings call that their earnings were strong due to the unfortunate amounts of COVID deaths. This was during Q3 earnings, and you’ll see in the chart below that there were massive increases in deaths during Q4 compared to Q3. The pandemic has instilled fear in many, and as deaths increase, the fear increases. This will likely result in increases in at need services and preneed bookings.  Many companies benefited from COVID from a financial perspective. $SCI is one that has seen a major boost in revenue’s from the pandemic, however they will not experience the some drop off. Death is an unfortunate thing, but will happen to us all. The aging Boomer population will continue to result in increased revenues for $SCI  Trades made  3/19 Options Calls, Long Equity  Research  CDC Deaths 2020 Vs 2019    The CDC is a bit behind on reporting of deaths, however most interesting correlation I found is that April had a major uptick in % differential for deaths. This major uptick, and sustained differential from April to September can arguably be attributed to the pandemic. Both due to COVID deaths, and indirect deaths as a result of the pandemic.  _____________________________________ EDIT: It was retarded, it was somewhat immoral, it worked. SCI reports $  EPS vs    EDIT: Listened to the call, dumped my calls: this one didn't work out. Too much uncertainty as   dying of COVID for this year.
Any ideas of the relationship between robinhood free stocks and the hedgefunds intentions?
Back in 2020 my first free stock was GME, I literally sold it right away. Once i referred my wifes boyfriend i got a $PSEC stock. Those 2 are different from what they use to give in 2019.

Old money trying to anticipate the top
The past two days there have been pretty sharp intra-day declines across the stock market that more or less recover. These are rather concerted efforts, and I didn’t put together the pieces until I saw CNBC pushing the “froth” narrative. The first dip happened at 10AM on Wednesday and the second happened 12:00PM on Thursday, February 11th.   The criteria seems to be NASDAQ Composite over 14k, Dow over   Whoever is doing this is using ridiculously broad market sell orders across hundreds, if not thousands, of securities at the same time. I don’t have a Bloomberg terminal, but I think they are trying to time the moment when the order book is either the most full, or most empty. If they are targeting the order books at the thinnest, that may be an attempt to cause a market crash.   However, if they are targeting the thickest or just a moderately full order book, then this is probably the collective consciousness of old money trying to time the market, and it will pass when they hear cool heads like Tom Lee explain the facts.  Anyone with more information/autism have any theories?
Fidelity sells your  options  order data too. Only stonks are kept in-house.
Fidelity's asset book allows them to keep order flow private for stonks, but even though they charge a .65c fee for options trades they still sell your order flow data.   The same is true of TDA.  Everyone does it at this point, so there's not much you can do about it. That said, I think everyone should know when they're the product and not the customer. If you primarily trade options in the US there is not a broker (that I'm aware of) that does not sell your order flow to someone like citadel.

One’s theory on the $RKT, Warren Buffet partnership.
The below link is not my post, and it is not my RKT DD part II. The link is a post by u/DBCooperlived in r/TeamRKT who is unable to post within WSB due to our hardworking mods.  The post contains a  SPECULATIVE  theory on the Berkshire / $RKT partnership. Although speculative, I believe it has much merit.   If this theory does come to fruition, I believe the world may witness another short squeeze that grabs international media attention. Fortunes will be made, but more importantly: memes will be made.   There is some Deep Fucking Value in this trade.   CLICK LINK BELOW:   ;utm_medium=ios_app ;utm_name=iossmf
My plan for maximum slow cooked chicken tendies
Let's all take a second to look around. What's been happening here? Rockets here, rockets there. This whole fucking sub is filled with people throwing around their red rockets. Some of these rockets go up into the ethereal tendie heavens, but most go plunge straight into the markets gaping, mangy abyss.  Why do I mention rockets?  Enter ARKX. The rocket itself. The real deal rocket. For all you tards who haven't looked up from blowing bubbles in your cereal for the past 10 years, let me paint you a picture on what has been going on.  The future is here. We are in a god damned technological revolution. Most of all, we're in a new space race. "Wait, you mean we're going back to blasting chimps into space then fingering their assholes when they get back, then telling the Reds to smell my finger?" No. We're going to space to stay. And you what's going to happen up there? Industry.  NASA already estimates that wealth from mining minerals on asteroids is in the QUADRILLIONS. I call bullshit on that figure. The universe is infinite. Therefore there is infinite wealth up there. NASA's gonna go up there, and some cuck with a clipboard will be like, "Yea, we lowballed that one."      I know, I know, all you dingleberrys that are stuck in the 80's, are thinking, "NASA choked on Challenger's dick and died right there on the spot." That's sure what it looked like. Well guess what. They're back, and they're now riding the coat tails of every fucking smooth-brained, money making messiah that you worship and make gainz off of. Did you look at the article that I linked? Probably not. I'll sum it up for you. Jeff Bezoz has his plans of going up there too, to do a little mining for himself. Look at his fucking head. Notice anything? IT'S SMOOTH AS EGGS. Draw your own conclusion on that one.  I don't really even need to touch on Papa Musk's plans. His mission is our mission. It's inherent at this point. You know everything that he touches turns into hard cash for you. Everytime you sit there trying to yank one out of your noodly, skinny pale trouser snake, you always have to, "pour one out for Elon." His target is to send 1 million people to Mars by 2050.      Do you think he's going to overpromise and underdeliver on that? Do you know what his kid's name is? This man is looking so far into the future, we don't even have language to express his kid's name.  Here's what's going to happen. In no more than 10 years time. More like 5 years. Captain Kirk will be on TV trying to sell you intergalactic travel packages at discounted rates. Of course you go. Your buddy, Chad, is stuck flipping burgers on some distant mining base, talking up all the dividends he's racking up bi-annually off his companies plan. You, on the other hand, have more nefarious plans in mind. Sure it's fun to hit Chad's bong on the dark side of some cold asteroid and talk about the old days, but you have better plans. You've got a date with a cheap alien lady-boy whore, parked on lovers lane overlooking the Eagle Nebula. All the while, you plan on going knuckles deep in any mucous filled orifice you can find. And that's on a THURSDAY.  So here's the skinny on ARKX. Listen up. For all the ass hats who don't know who Cathie Wood is, you will now. In 2018, Papa Musk was in a bit of a rut. He was losing faith in TSLA, and contemplating it's future, (I know, hard to believe). In fact, it was so bad, Elon was practically begging to suck Tim Apples ding-a-ling to get bought up.      You know who was there by Papa Musk's side? That's right. Meet your new mommy, Momma Wood. She gave Papa Elon the best fucking prostate orgasm ever, and with that, the clarity that TSLA was going to propel him to Mars and beyond. So every time you're having wet dreams about sucking Elon's monster dong, you're eternally in debt to Mama Wood. But she doesn't fault you for not giving her credit. You know why that is? Because she is a Goddess. She's humble. She knows that at some point, one day, your eyes will be opened, and that you will recognize her for her past efforts, and for her future plans. ARKX. She knows that once you have this realization, you will be bent over, gallon jug of off-branded cooking fat in hand, ready to have her peg your stanky ingrown hair infested asshole. You will be BEGGING her, "MoAR tHicC GaINz, PLEEZE!"   So what's play here. I love a good YOLO. I wake up every morning expecting to see gainz porn from all these rocket launches we've been having. For me, personally, I'm mildly autistic. You could say half-autistic. My wife and her boyfriend's children are all autistic. I want the YOLO gainz, but I also want to know where to put some of my gainz, as my wife, her boyfriend, and their children are all dependent on me for money. So I got to be smart, you see. As I see it, ARKX is a slow cooker for your tendies. There's nothing like making a cool, quick ten bagger on some FD's. That rush is unmatched. That feeling of having a greasy burger after munching on your boyfriends asshole for an hour straight. ARKX, on the other hand, is like few have thought to experience. Like fine aged wine or whiskey. Slow cooked, tender, melt in your melt tendies. 100x in the next ten years, conservatively, tendies. Set-it-and-forget-it tendies. They practically fall apart in your mouth.   This DD doesn't even begin to touch the vastness of what's all in play with space exploration plays.  I don't know what's going to be in ARKX, or where it will begin trading at. I also don't know the exact date it will begin trading, I heard the last week of March at the latest. Keep an eye out. I'm sure you will hear when it does commence. For me, I already threw a bunch of stagnant savings I had in ARKF. Let me tell you what, I am not disappointed I did that. When ARKX comes out, my IRA will be converted to ARKX, but I will be keeping my boomer AAPL, and holy TSLA shares. I will be set. I have utmost confidence this will be the easiest, long term print around.   Thank you for your time. I'm a half retard, not an investment advisor.   TLDR: ARKX will print you space tendies for all your orifice fingering needs.
Prediction: Bestbuy stock is going to tank
A friend of mine has worked for Bestbuy for the last eight years.  She  just got laid off along with a whole bunch of other people not just at  hear store, but all across the country.  She was told that the company  is going to be going through an across the board restructuring.  I  expect the stock to kick up a couple points because the layoffs will  bring more profits, but then its going to tank.  It's too late in the  game to restructure your entire business model.  If you own Bestbuy  stock I would recommend getting out while the getting is good.  I'm not a  financial advisor and I'm not your advisor.
#SaveTheMalls for a Good Long-Term (Yes, the Dreaded Word on WSB) Investment Opportunity
So, I want you all to listen up and listen up good. We've become pimps for equities: prop 'em up to make them look pretty and sell them off to a troglodyte infested with STD's. We need to change the way we see stocks as a piece of a company that offers potentially good returns with a little bit of patience and gambling. Get-rich-quick schemes, as we have seen throughout the last 30 days can easily turn into get-broke-even-faster gambles that ruin your wallet and faith in the stock market.  You might've heard "you want to invest in your future." Take it seriously. Throwing 10-50 stacks at GameStop to fend off "short ladder attacks" or injecting steroids into a no-name Canadian weed company that rivals the market cap of Wendy's is pretty reckless, and you deserve to lose that money when it craters. INVEST LONG TERM BUT GAMBLE WITH THE MARKET. Make sounds decisions but make bets on market conditions to fulfill your cocaine addiction.  With that said, there's a great investment opportunity in SPG (Simon Property Group). Simon is an American commercial real estate company, one of the largest REITs, and the largest shopping mall operators in the US. They had a steep selloff in March of last year, but has seen a rise of 3100 basis point YTD (31%). They have more room to climb because of stock momentum, COVID vaccines, consumer demand, and a aggressive strategy to stay ahead of competition. Despite this, they're still bullish. During the Q4 call, they remain "confident" that the worse is behind them, and SPG is trading at a discount of $109 to its target price consensus of $125.  In 2020 with COVID ravaging the bottom line for a lot of companies, they pulled in some impressive numbers.    Company Statistics Over the Last Year back from December 2020      generated over $  billion in operating cash flow;   acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group who specialize in super-regional and outlet shopping malls in the United States and China (China is back in business, remember?) ;   raised over $13 billion in the debt and equity markets   opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others and completed three domestic redevelopments;   returned more than $2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends paid (for comparison, even though they're not a REIT, Ford suspended dividends along with many other companies)   Occupancy was   at December 31, 2020. (Doesn't even seem like COVID made a dent).   Base minimum rent per square foot was $  at December 31, 2020, an increase of   year-over-year.   Extensive, permanent cost-cutting measures were implemented to reduce operating expenses and offset revenue decline. (Leaner businesses are best equipped for a rebound in profits)    Chart Analysis    They have historically been almost spot on with moving average analysis. Comparing their 50-day and 200-day moving average, they're currently on a bullish trend, positive upward momentum to a higher stock price. The short term moving average is above the long term line, thus indicating they're in for a good run in the near future.    COVID Vaccines    We know that the Biden administration is pushing for vaccinations. For good reason: once we're at herd immunity, states will be opening up because they're in need for revenue after incurring major expenses to keep their hospitals and small businesses staffed and opened during the height of the pandemic. Today we learned that the Biden administration is moving up their timeline to distribute vaccines after Pfizer and Moderna made a deal to provide 200 million shots. Once people are vaccinated to the threshold of herd immunity, the economy will start moving in the right direction. And, remember, Simon is trading a discount now. Once people feel more comfortable being around others, mall traffic can expect to increase.    Summary    I know some of you see the market as a casino. But, if you bet on America, you can never go wrong. Once sentiment changes, if it hasn't already curved in a better direction, businesses will attract the traffic. Maybe not pre-pandemic levels for some, but their stock price will rise as we get closer. SPG is primed for a return built on solid fundamentals (curse word in this sub?), an upward trend based on chart analysis, and growing confidence in our ability to be around others after much fatigue. Right now, betting on America is wagering if we can make a recovery. And when have we been unable to recover as a country?  Full Disclosure: I'm long on SPG.
Need a Secret Code to get rid of boomers, newbs, reporters, and  🦧
I think I’ve been contacted by at least 5 reporters asking for me to comment or talk on the phone.    I don’t speak for WSB. Shit, I can barely even speak. My gay uncle is transcribing this for me (he loves SPY puts).    Since this sub blew up we’ve got fucking MM interns taking notes. We have main stream and even piss stream media reporting hourly on our every move.    Every boomer is trying to ride the fucking WSB tendie train that it looks like the fucking Mumbai Body Odor express with every telemarketing scam dude who has called you in the past year hanging off the sides of the choochoo.  It’s like Rahjeet the Tank Engine up in this shit.    We need some sort of secret code so that when we say “puts on Companhia Siderurgica Nacional” we mean “DIS calls”    This is some bullshit now. We have every fuck clown in here reading the playbook and sucking us dry. And it’s not even a good sucking like your dad gives me. Shut up Uncle Blaine. Stop transcribing this shit you   . FUCK!
FCX dd-Copper is in a breakout from recent highs and someone looks to be manipulating the worlds biggest copper miner(FCX)downward to scoop up shares on the cheap on the heels of the upcoming bull run, plus more DD
Ok guys, this seems like its gonna be pretty big. Copper by all technical indicators has broken out and is in price discovery due to mines being shut down, historically low stockpiles, reopening demands, inevitable inflation, and an upcoming EV boom.     The past three days have been huge for copper, ending up with a net gain of almost   which for copper is pretty fucking big.   Yesterday morning it was also upgraded to a buy by JPM. After starting the morning out +6% it dropped hard during that market wide dip. Now keep in mind FCX is not the hottest stock in the world so its volume is pretty low. I have no proof but given its low volume it would be extremely easy to manipulate downwards so you can load up. After speculating why this could be happening all day, it happened.    AT CLOSE SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED   MILLION SHARES         shares, 85 Million dollars worth.  While the rest of the market slowly recovered the rest of the day FCX continued to walk downwards and ended at   on a day where copper was   Add in the day before where where it opened low and ended flat when copper had another  , and today again where copper ended up   and FCX was for some reason down again at   Again keep in mind that FCX is super low volume so manipulating it would be expensive but easy.  The charts from FCX and the copper index ETF (CPER) generally mirror eachother and is pretty easily verifiable by looking at the charts. Well until recently that is, they both peaked on 1/14, the last time copper was at its recent high, the CPER etf is up   since then and for some extremely strange reason FCX is down   That is a 6% deviation on genuine boomer metrics. As of today there were no massive buys AH but who inows whats going on in dark pools as my broker is showing its up AH on zero volume.  I know copper has been in an epic run but factor in the upcoming EV boom with looming inflation and a supply shortage and copper is most likely poised to shoot past all time highs with supply at historic lows and demand soon to be at an all time high. Feel free to look at the FCX all time chart to see how parabolic runs are a frequent thing in their history and we may be entering one.  Beyond that, this was also put up by yahoo today.     Just some food for thought.  Position: 208   3/5c  This is not financial advice.
AMD to the moon
After the short squeeze now we have the semiconductor squeeze. NVIDIA is going to the moon ( . So if the uncle goes to the moon, the niece will go to the moon too. Buy AMD now to go to the moon with them.  Position:  40 AMD calls Jan 2023 @ $150  3239 AMD shares
Govment just announced they're stepping in to resolve the semi-conductor shortage. CRSR held down by shorts. For the smoothbrains that means CRSR is about to go
I've been posting my retarded YOLO play on CRSR .  Position:     100 x 3/19 70C +  500 shares avg $   Am I really eating crayons? Yes, I butt-chugged a 60 pack of Crayola this morning so DYOR and decide for yourself.  First and only thing you really need to know is   RGB = buy.    But since this sub has been infiltrated by FUD-filled, paper handed wrinklebrain-bears, heres why I am on my way to the moon and it’s not too late for you...                             RECAP    Breif history of CRSR, the stock blew up post IPO from $17, riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic.  It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36. The float is low so swings are volatile. Also lots of short volume bla bla    1/13   - a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum. Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze (maybe retail and/or institutional....Citadel is 2% owner of CRSR float)... or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters, who knows?  Cool, so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap. It starts climbing back to the average peak levels, then ...    1/27   - CRSR announces a secondary PO of   million   hits a high of $49, before a 2 day selloff.  Crash Boogaloo.  After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report, with expectations of excellent numbers. IV is through the roof. Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable.    2/9    -    CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report.   EPS beats estimates, $  revenue for the year, profit margins way up, debt is down, and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT. The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages (which every other tech company is dealing with too).   After this amazing ER, the stock tops out at about $48   nosediving, nearly hitting $40.   Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype, so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest.   But looking at what actually happned, it wasn't actually just hype. The pre-ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs.  The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021, so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV   limits were triggered, self-fulfilling prophecy.     So the price starts to fall into oversold territory. Quote from Barron's "Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy, and one has a Hold rating on the name." Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull. Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9  But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to "Neutral" from "Buy", causing the selloff to dip even lower, hitting just above $40. Their justification? They think gaming demand could wane in 2021, and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100% of demand due to shortages of chimps. (ha!)                                                                               CURRENT SITUATION    That brings us to today. CRSR is way oversold. $  profitable   $  market cap for a fast-growth tech company? pitiful. Almost every analyst, including Goldman, has increased their price targets, many above $50.   Compare that to LOGI..$  revenue ($  TTM), at $  market cap and climbing fast.  Speaking of LOGI, check out this  .   1/19 Post-Earnings dip, before running to ATH 2 weeks later.     But CRSR price is still down, why my neuro-atypical friends?  Maybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50% every day?     Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back (we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon.)  But pressure is easing, as of 1/29, short interest dropped 44% from the previous report. And daily short volume dipped below 50% yesterday for the first time in months (this isn't a squeeze play, this means that short downward pressure is backing off).  IVs starting to return to earth.  And what also happened today? The P OTUS just   by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority. Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand, and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade.    The gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases. We all know new players get hooked, and there are tens of millions of them since last year. The more they game the more they’ll be looking to buy new gear. They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more.   They also currently have a big stake in the streaming market, which 1000% isn't going away  Without the shortages, there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential.   With the rest of the rockstar fundamentals, this is a $65-$70 stock EASY. You will not beat this entry point.   Very minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least.     TL;DR   RGB = Buy. Get on the  . You’ll thank me in a month.   Or don’t listen to me because that 60 pack was just breakfast. DYOR    Clarification for all the recently acquired WSB dipshits confused how a stock could be good without 200% short interest and near bankruptcy fundamentals, this isn't a squeeze   pressure is backing off because they know it has actual legs.
I never knew it was possible to lose this much in one day with just shares
Sea of Red.
Ok, everybody needs to take a few deep breaths and cool it.
We need to set one thing straight. Do we have the power to move the stock market or not? Just 2 weeks ago the overwhelming sentiment was "this is the hedge funds game, we're just trying to catch a ride. Individual retail investors can't do shit to move markets. We're hyennas picking at Zebra carcasses, but sooner or later the Lions are going to come back and reclaim their feast."   Now it's a complete 180. I'm seeing tons of outrage from people who got burnt today on their weed calls. Acting like this lot of new degenerates came in and pumped the price before bailing, thus crushing the overall market. 20% gains for them cost you tens of thousands on your call options. Well, how much blame does the media get? 8 million people in this sub is a lot, but how many people does CNBC, Fox Business, The Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, The New York Times, etc. Reach? When they all band together and spend 2-3 full trading days only talking about "the new Wall Street Bets move", how many day traders come running? Just Google "Wall Street Bets weed" to see what I'm talking about.  We're either being played, or it's actually us having this big of an impact on the market. I don't know the answer. So let's look at both scenarios.     We control the market    This is dope! We can work with this, and grow into it, but first I want to get something off my chest. FUCK YOU! Talkin bout "degenerates ruining my weed plays". Bitch, what have you been chortling about with GME this whole time? "    Gang got greedy and forgot to hedge profits."  "I took my gains at 300 like a pro."  "It's so funny how the smooth brains got left holding the bag."  Preaching about holding the line in January while you turned 100 @ $5 into 15 @ $50, then switched to pissing on "bag holders" for "getting played" in February.   If we truly have the power to move markets, then the $10's of millions in profits everyone took is what brought down the rising market caps. It also bailed out the shorts who were/are less than halfway done covering (TLRY has high SI too). Then we went and did the exact same thing with weed stocks. Don't hate the player, hate the game right? Ultimately, something tells me stocks don't move up when everyone is trying to play with house money. Definitely can't "hold any lines" with house money either. We should invest in stocks we care about for their long term potential; any squeezes or pumps that potentially come out of that are just an added benefit.    We don't have the power to move markets     That's cool. We're still getting blamed for it, though. Not just from salty weed "bag holders" in here, but from all of the media. We got blamed for this meteoric rise, and within 20 minutes of the tank in pre-market CNBC was already pointing the finger at us. Weed Stocks have been on the rise for 3 months, if you guys were just riding a wave none of us "retail traders" have any control over, then what crashed it? I won't speculate on that because it falls under "conspiracy bullshit" but we should discuss it. I posted   claiming it was a diversion attempt away from GME, and urged people to "cash out their gains before it crashes." I wrote it before the price tanked. The mods deleted it, and rightfully so. I don't have any evidence to back up that theory. What I'm trying to say now isn't about GME either.   However, if we don't actually have any control over the stock market we should be using the media manipulation to make fat gains before we get fucked by big time day traders and algorithm options trading. As soon as they dump a trend on us, we should dump that trend. If the price follows immediately, we'll know we actually have control of these markets, if it doesn't we'll know we're getting played and figure out why. What do you guys think? Quit "REEEEE"-ing all over the place and let's figure this shit out!!    RIP to all the people who bought both TLRY and GME at their peaks and still have no idea what happened.  Edit: I'm not a financial advisor. Everything above is pure speculation. I'm just a dude bored during a Pandemic who apparently likes losing money. (also changed some wording in OP)
New People: Understand the difference between MEME content and actual trading habits
Because my last post got deleted, here's a more "friendly" version.  The memes on here use to be hilarious, uncensored, offensive and some of the worst advice you could possibly imagine. The thing is people understood the humor. Most understood market fundamentals and traded options. If you trade options you're a big brain mf, congrats and fuck you.  But new people reposting these shitpost memes everywhere, on every social media channel, comment thread, where ever, you're kinda fucking it up imo.  There was a massive difference between sharing personal investment/yolo stories to a group of 10-900K people and trying to hype up specific stocks to   MILLION or more random folks.  Ever since GME, WSB has become famous. So famous that   People with money are going to take advantage of this easily influenced massive group of retail traders for their own gain if they haven't already.     So what is the message here?  You should know the difference between investing and gambling, between GME and any other stock. Memes for GME do NOT apply to EVERY OTHER STOCK when it falls or when you're holding. The memes were fun but they really ONLY APPLIED to the GME situation.  If you want to invest please please please spend some time getting a basic understanding of volatility, risk management, trend patterns. Read the analysis behind companies before you invest. This is probably the ONLY time where "Do your own research" ACTUALLY BENEFITS YOU.  And always remembers that if you're gambling to rapidly make gains, you can just as suddenly lose your money.  Enjoy the memes, just don't bet on them.     This is not financial advice, I'm not even a real person
