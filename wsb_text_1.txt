Like the post said, I used to work at a small AI based hedge fund, it went under. I just joined WSB to say, what you guys did with GameStop is delicious.  There are all these algos from all these hedge funds operating  on specialized ASIC chips, collocated on the exchanges operating in microseconds, getting real time data.  And through sheer logic, analysis and balls you undid them all.  I giggled like a school girl. Well done.   There is no algo out there that could have foreseen this, it‚Äôs too novel.   I‚Äôm more of a value investor myself, but couldn‚Äôt help but tip my hat to you guys.  Well played guys!
AMC DISCOUNT AT 9$. BUY AND HOLD RETARDS!!!!
WE CAN DO THIS  APES   TOGETHER   STRONG!
Safe to assume any negativity are peeps getting paid to demotivate. Smart strat GME AMC NOK BB
Public is allowing trades to NAKD and others
Was easy to setup, similar to Robinhood.
GME low, buy buy buy - they scared we‚Äôre gonna push it over $500!
ROBIN HOOD BLOCKS GME, AMC etc. THIS MEANS WE MUST BUY BB
So an app called "Robinhood" is mad the poor are taking from the rich?
Their PR department has to love this.
When this is over and we‚Äôve seized the means of production. We‚Äôre building a GameStop on Wallstreet
The system is broken. An unregulated corporation tried to stop Gamers from   to the   by cheating at the game we were winning fair and square. We liked the stock. We were engaged to the stock. And they said they wouldn‚Äôt let us marry the stock.  They keep more   hidden from us where   can‚Äôt join together be strong. They take   tree away when   together have     . We go find tree by any means necessary.
Can I still be apart of this or is it too LATE?
I've clearly been living under a rock and didn't even know what amazing things you guys were doing. But now I wanna know is it too late for me to be able to do this? Have I missed the timeframe?

I‚Äôll start. I bought at   and I‚Äôm holding because I like this stock.
Is there any way to check current short positions?
As in, are they still shorting more shares than exist?  I'd like some way of verifying if the short squeeze is still outstanding or not.
Cryptobros - anywhere to trade for GME and viceversa?
I think I can speak for most cryptobros when I say that we are all watching this unfold with great interest. You are doing what we have set out to achieve which is to bring the power back to the people and it is fantastic to watch. Had I a means of rapidly gaining access to a stockbroker where I am I would join in the good fight, but with Robinhood down and sounding questionable and no leverage options that I can find for Europe I must give only my support.  May your gains be massive and the hedge fund short sellers be crushed like the companies they ruin with downward pressure. Go get 'em!    if someone can recommend somewhere I can trade GME on leverage I'll be right here with you and so will other cryptobros I am sure
STOP SELLING
Stop selling. This is us vs them, have faith in yourself!
Can we get a legitimate thread about AMC going made by an account not one day old
Hi, it me. Not a bot.   AMC is red, I‚Äôm sure a lot of AMC holders are negative. It‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôve seen what GME can do. We know what shorts are trying to do with AMC based on the whooping GME laid out. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre doing anything they can to suppress AMC.   It will rise, just don‚Äôt sell for a loss, average down if you have to. Be smart with your money. Obviously not financial advice. But the market is insane and don‚Äôt let it get your emotions crazy if you‚Äôre new around here.
A bunch of retarded autists have the top   TERRIFIED of us.
These motherfuckers took EVERYTHING from our parents in 2008. We have to see this through to the end (whatever that may be). It‚Äôs not about money at this point. This is about principles. This is about blatant corruption. This is about beating these fucks at their own game. Look at the impact this sub has had!
CALL YOUR BROKERS AND TELL THEM YOUR SHARES are NOT UP FOR GRABS for GOD DAMN SHORTS.
Freetrade UK app glitching unable to buy or sell gme
Got a few gme shares in this app. Can't sell. The wheel just spins. Didn't want to sell until next week anyway.  Can't buy either.  Sure happy not to have yolo'd my life savings right now
THIS IS WAR! Robin Hood market manipulation of $GME $BB $AMC $NOK just makes me like the stock even more. A small hurdle on the way to the moon     One small step for man, but one giant leap for my fellow autists! Strap in this is going to be special
Hold your stocks fam don‚Äôt let them scare you
Please, not the time for panic!
Listen retards,  hold your shares. Robinhood doesn't allow buying? That's bad, but it doesn't keep you from  not  selling. Just hold, and wait for the actual squeeze to happen. As a non-american i can't say for sure, but you should be able to open an account at another broker and transfer your portfolio BUT that will take some time, probably days if not weeks. So stay cool.  Secondly, stop pumping shit stocks or currencies, I don't know if you are all just stupid (which is worse than retarded) but that kind of fits the mainstream medias portrayal of WSB and goes against the subreddit rules as far as I know.  Thirdly, pray for the mods. They are doing an amazing job so far and I wish them the strengthiest of strengths to keep swinging that big banhammer against anyone spamming the new section.  Last but not least, keep taking your vitamins, I know that tensions are high so keep your cool, next week we will be rich, not today, so stay cool. Be like the WSB poster dude: He wears cool sunglasses. He doesn't panic. Be like that guy.  Those still able to trade, enjoy the dip and consider buying some more. (Not financial advice i am as smart as everyone else here, which is not so smart).  Feel free to post all your worries into the comments, so that the main feed can relax a bit.  Positions: Balls deep into GME (left, low hanging ball) and BB (right ball).
How we are going to beat them.
Those of you who cannot buy BB, NOK, AMC, GME. Exercise your in the money calls. Force them to buy the float up and give shares to you. You will still have your positions.
HOLDING GME. HOLDING AMC. BUYING MORE.
And Robinhood can kiss my ass.

Business Model
Now that we all own a share of GameStop do you guys think maybe we could persuade them improve their business model a little bit? It's really the only place to buy games from offline and I love them but I feel like they need some improvements.

RH refugee - Webull isn‚Äôt loading, any other suggestions?
TLDR: what is the most reliable way to get in right now, Webull won‚Äôt load and RH screwed me over   Before this I only had a RH account. RH canceled my order this morning at 6:25am   Is anyone else experiencing this? I could sign in to Webull but it‚Äôs not letting me open an account. It just says ‚Äúloading failed‚Äù. Has anyone else looking for a way to buy in this morning found a viable path in the last few hours?    I‚Äôm so mad at RH rn!    The insulting thing is their messaging said ‚Äúyou‚Äôve cancelled your order‚Äù how exactly? I was asleep. They don‚Äôt even have a message template for when they cancel a transaction!  I plan on pulling all my money from RH and deleting that trash off my phone. I hate when companies think they can treat their user base like this.  Thanks!

ROBINHOOD: please review 15   Code ¬ß 78i - Manipulation of Security Prices! Thanks :)
A couple snippets of actual law they would very clearly appear to be in violation of:     (a): Transactions relating to purchase or sale of security: It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of national securities exchange,   (1): For the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any security other than a government security, or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for any such security (A) to effect any transaction in such security which involves no change in beneficial ownership...  (2): To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange...creating actual or apparent active trading in such activity, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others...  (6): To effect either alone or with one or more other persons any series of transactions for the purchase and/or sale of any security other than a government security for the purpose of pegging, fixing, or stabilizing the price of such security in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate.   Slow your roll, big media- WSB did NOT violate these rules, even by the logic that platforms like Robinhood are clearly doing it right now. Take $GME, for example (which is on its way to $2500 btw). Media would like to believe we inflated the price of the security beyond a reasonable explanation and as such are guilty of market manipulation. But it‚Äôs a  market , it‚Äôs worth whatever the majority say it is. And clearly we all love the stock, so you tell me- did we lie to the media or the SEC when we placed the orders at the price points we were publicly posting about moving towards?   No! The reality is, there isn‚Äôt a shred of legal basis to the claim that this sub ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù anything, and in truth so long as it is not possible for a lone redditor to convince the world a security is worth more than it is, it is not possible to call the collective agreement on a stock by a publicly speaking body ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù. By that standard, all of StockTwits would have to be tried. There are simply so many ways that indemnify this subs content from charges- people are allowed to express and hold any position about any security regardless of whether or not there‚Äôs   million other degenerates with the same brilliant idea.  Robinhood on the other hand has blatantly (and strategically) obfuscated securities data and restricted investor rights in a poor attempt to control the volatility and interest in specific securities. And yes, a class-action is absolutely in order!   Fuck the news, fuck Robinhood, fuck Melvin, fuck it all. Time for them to learn!! All the way folks  ü§≤
KEEP COOL! The reason why the stocks are down is that trading is halted on some platforms! DON'T SELL!
I'm in NOK and BB and will still be till  day.
LETS GO BB
Withdraw all your assets and cash from Robinhood
They are not on your side, they literally want to deter you from the tendies because guess who is on the losing side of these trades? Their big shot wealthy pals, who are absolutely flustered seeing their wealth vanish because of hubris.  Transfer all assets you can out of Robinhood as soon as possible. Contact support, this kind of thing should be illegal. The fact that you can't even hedge an open position on their platform because the broker wants to protect their buddies is straight fucked.  EDIT FOR THOSE AUTISTS WHO CAN'T READ: THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR SHARES, YOU CAN TRANSFER THEM TO ANOTHER BROKERAGE.
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong my lore may be incorrect.
I thought Robinhood was a guy that stole from the rich and gave to the people, but it seems Robinhood is just trying to fuck the poor.
For every non American that want to buy gme FAST go on   verification takes about 5min.
My friend bought into the GME war today, he said "It's destiny"
Open orders and Trading Halts explained
When a stock gets halted by the exchange the open orders are allowed to be cancelled. In reality they don't always get cancelled, that probably depends on the brokerage. But by the rulebook, open orders are allowed to be canceled when a stock is halted. This allows the exchange to reset and reduce volatility.   I am seeing posts complaining about trades being cancelled in GME and others. GME has been halted at least three times this morning.
HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD HOLD
We can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent, and no amount of market manipulation can change that. We already know what we have to do
This is who we're up against. HOLD
Is Webull being overloaded? Having trouble making an account
Trying to transfer from Robinhood, but the in-app "open account", "deposit", and "transfer account" links don't do anything when I tap them in the app, and the account page won't load on the website.
Use ACATS if you want to transfer brokerages!!!
After this while Robinhood and TD Ameritrade fiasco, I know a lot of you brave souls are pissed like I am.   If you want to transfer, DON'T sell your investments and reinvest in a new brokerage...  Most brokers utilize the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS). Simply contact a new brokerage you like and ask them for the forms to begin the process.   On average, the process takes 6 business days... But that's nothing if you are     .  Good luck out there...
BB AND AMC NEED OUR HELP TOO
Don't forget the not-GME stocks!
BUY THE FUCKING $AMC DIP BOIS

$AMC DROPPED TO   USD, DONT LET THIS FOOL YOU
BUY MORE AND HOLD - THIS IS SCARE TACTICS
Robinhood is crashing??? Nothing is working though the app. Anyone else?
They‚Äôre shorting BB AMC and NOK
AND MAKING YOU PANIC SELL
DON'T BE SELLING YOUR $BB $AMC $NOK JUST BECAUSE IT'S DROPPING. WAIT TIL THEY RECOVER, THEN SELL FOR GME
This is not financial advice. From my pea brained understanding, the more GME we have and hold, the more we grip their balls and milk out every last drop.
NOK is developing SNAKE   (HOLD)
If you're upset with Robinhood, you might consider leaving a review on the App Store that reflects how you feel about the app.
This is not financial advice, and I'm not suggesting you should give them a certain rating. Just rate the app accurately.
AMC tanking
I hold the line. Waiting for all you to come in and me it go
GME
How do I even buy GME if brokers are removing that ability?
Downloaded Robinhood last night only to see that it doesn‚Äôt allow you to buy GME at the moment.   I‚Äôd love some input so I can help drive this train to the moon.
Did everyone just abandoned amc?

I‚Äôm pretty sure you can fund and trade same day after creating a fidelity account

Freetrade works for AMC AND BB
Hold the line fellas
We need to come together, more than ever before, and hold our position
They can‚Äôt stop us from buying these stocks forever. They think we are weak and will crack at the first glimpse of pressure. But what they don‚Äôt know is that we are much stronger and much smarter than they think. We will get them back, we just have to wait for our time to strike. Be patient and we will hit them harder than before.
It's amazing how much WSB has brought people together, from all sectors of the political spectrum.
This is the revolution the left and the right have been longing for. This is the one issue that brings us all together. Although, I will say it's heartwarming to see people wake up to the media's smears, calling WSB alt-right and nazis. They do the same to everyone else who try to buck the system.  And you know what? We like the stock.
$RKT and $REV next
Rocket for the Revolution!

CLASS ACTION AGAINST STASH INVEST
BLOCKING Retail traders from buying or selling stock.  Blocking access to their account details and portfolios.   Missing funds from their initial investment balances without details on where it went   is MARKET MANIPULATION, FRAUD and THEFT.
Robinhood Alternative.
Due to recent events, I'm looking to invest my money through other brokerages (non-manipulative, specifically). Unfortunately I quite enjoyed their interface and app. Looking for something similar. What do you suggest?
IS this why some brokers halted trading?
MY broker is vanguard, they briefly suspended trading on GME, once i refreshed my browser it allowed a trade. But when it halted, it stated that it was due to regulation that came from the 2010 Flash Crash. I'm too stupid to comprehend this... someone read this and tell me!

RATE THEM DOWN ON GOOGLE PLAY / APP STORE
Upvote so more people see it. Robinhood and the other brokers doing market manipulation to save their daddys hedge funds. Vote them fucking down on Google Play and App Store. Hurt them where it hurts.
SELL YOUR AMC, BB AND NAKD. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR TIME - FOCUS ON GME! ALL FOCUS ON GME.
For real, we have to focus all of our autistic energy on the right thing.  GME will hit the hardest against  these hedge fund babies as of now - and we are seeing unprecedented teamwork. Never before seen collaborative autism. Weaponized aspergers on a level that has never been observed in real life before.  We are fighting one of the most important fights of this decade, we are serving the punishment to these hedge fund crybabies. We will make them pay and we will make them bleed.  Now please - for the love of god - buy GME. Put all you got into it.
Always buy the dip!
Hold The Line
So much for a free market.  Hedge funds sold out of hours, when most of us couldn't trade.  Now NOK, AMC, NAKD, GME are all either hidden or blocked from buying on most platforms.  How can you help? Hold the line. Do not sell. If anything, buy more of stocks above.
If you‚Äôre using Robinhood, it‚Äôs time to transfer your account to another platform.
Robinhood is currently blocking AMC, BB, and only allowing you to sell GME. You can transfer your account to another platform like Webull for a $75 charge (also another Robinhood policy). Whatever you do though DO NOT SELL!!!! They are blatantly manipulating their platform for the hedge fund‚Äôs and need to be brought down for these HIGHLY unethical practices. DON‚ÄôT GIVE THEM ANY MORE OF YOUR BUSINESS!!!!  For those who want to know how to transfer see here:
GHSI
Worth it?
THE BIGGEST FUCK YOU: FILE COMPLAINTS, WRITE REVIEWS, SWITCH YOUR BROKER, AND DONT BUY ONE SHARE OF RH WHEN THEY IPO

$AMC is getting hit hard!!
HOLD it out. Don‚Äôt sell.
ROBINHOOD: Can't add new bank account??
Maybe I'm starting to wear a tinfoil hat because of all the crazy stuff happening in the markets this week but......  I can't add a new bank account to Robinhood to transfer money in. I'm on the Android app.  Has this been intentionally removed?  Or am I an idiot?   Yes, both is likely but the latter is certain.
PULL OUT OF ROBINHOOD - DO NOT SELL - HERE IS THE LINK

Can you explain this to me like I am 5?
Hi everyone!   New here. So there is a ton of people I know and on tiktok (I know I know hate on us) that want to help eat the rich. We love what's going on here but none of know where to start or what stocks to buy to aide in this movement. Especially, now that Robin hood has blocked alot. Can someone explain what's going on like I am five and what stocks yall are investing in, when to buy and sell it and when to hold? I have always wanted to get into stocks but didn't know where to start but also I just want some genuine education on the topic! I hope this post is okay and I don't seem to dumb for asking.
AMC Stock is going really deep in the shit hole almost a %50 Loss
Honestly I‚Äôm getting cold feet and that includes $NOK as well. In all honesty is a sell a smart choice?  Edit: Holy shit okay lmao I‚Äôm holding and I‚Äôll buy more once Robinhood let‚Äôs me or when I move to another trading app because fuck Robinhood
First time trading, what should I get?
Love what the boys are doing here, Im just not sure which companies to buy into, any advice? Thanks fellas!
It seems like a one two punch to restrict buying in a stock and deny access to the trading platform. TDAMERITRADE YOU SUCK
The stock can only go down if nobody can buy it.  Is this appropriate for a class action lawsuit?
What‚Äôs happening with BB?
Should I sell before I lose more or keep holding?
WERE FAILING! STOP SELLING $AMC AND $GME!
Re: Robinhood blocking trading, what did you think these HFs were going to do? Roll over and take this? This is the big fight, only expect more. And keep those DHs

Robinhood ceo is on yahoo finance
They are going to try to ban /wallstreetbets starting Jan. 31.
When "they" released the Cerveza sickness, they wanted to make people not gather like we do here. They knew about this power and will not allow it! So, starting Jan. 31, any "triggering" social media with millions of followers will be illegal.   Where will we gather?
Is Webull down? Was trying to create and account and I think the server is crashing.

Please reach us at 1-800-ETRADE-1 (1-800-387-2331) or via online chat for resolution.      Is this just a result of high traffic or is there something more?
THEY FEAR US.
Robinhood just lost 20k followers on twitter in 60 minutes!
Let me help you with that
Removal of Robinhood off App Store and Playstore.
Robinhood needs to be removed from both Apple and Android devices. Apple and Android should both announce there decision to remove Robinhood in the next few days.  What Robinhood did today was illegal and unjustified. Some companies need to stand against this behavior.
Robin to be uninstalled after hold
After landing on the moon Robinhood is dead. Which app are you planning on moving to or already moved to for more buy/hold.

Ally Investments Market Manipulation
Ally Investments is not allowing Market purchases for GME, BB, or AMC. They will only allow Limit purchases. I am new to this but this seems like the subpar way to buy. What do I do?
Now that Robinhood betrayed us, let‚Äôs start our own exchange, with strippers and blackjack!

Help out the mods
I think all of us have profited somehow in WSB. Either by entering GME or by having a laugh with all the stuff that's posted here. So...  Let's help out! Please donate to the mods or to the WSB mod king ZJZ:    His Wallet is:  bc1qvpf5dax8l82u4e9heanawkk8ntaqk6qufvx76k   This is NOT to kick ass or anything like that but to be generous with people that are here keeping things running. Seriously, these people work for peanuts with little to no sleep I think.   Gold is great, but money helps you eat. I don't know if you can go to Walmart and pay some tendies with a reddit award. So let's help them out :)

Robinhood sold my BB shares

heres a theory: please tell me im wrong
heres a theory:  melvin used the $  bailout money and bought long positions at $80 and up with the leverage they have at their brokers  together with their hedge friends they now own substantial volume.. they have also taken up new short positions at 300-400 (as reflected by the short ratio jump).. at a predetermined point, they will cash out their longs and make bank on their new shorts as the price plummets... theres probably some ratio and price points that will work out in their favour  when the price settles below $15 they close their old shorts leaving retails holding $200-300 bags  melvin was never in any trouble to begin with.. sure they have interest payments, but thats a problem money can solve  so is there a scenario where melvin can minimise their losses, or even come up on top?
BUY EVERY HALT 1$ ABOVE SO YOUR ORDER GETS FILLED
FUCK WALL STREET
Listen: They Want Us to Have a Net Sell Today
Dear All,     Disclaimer: I'm not a financial expert or financial advisor. I'm just a dude with ChemE & CS Major who Minored in Economics. This is a merely post to open up discussion and panic over the current state of   our portfolio       As you all might know, we aren't allowed to buy stocks. Meaning there will be a net   sell which drives the price of the stock to go down.   Let's Discuss what can YOU DO     # What's The Solution to Reduce the Price To Go Down?  One thing we can do is to HOLD. I'd love to drop additional 30k if I'm allowed to which positively impact the price.  # Where we go from here?  Well we all know that call options expire tomorrow. Which have a  high possibility  of a price increase. I'm talking about $GME, $AMC, $BB and $BBBY. This is a TEST for all of us whether we can handle the pressure or not. Diamond is created under High Pressure and not Low Pressure like one in outer space. But you know what they said.  Diamond is Forever   Here's the catch: We don't know whether Robinhood will pull another scheme like this or not. This is something to keep in mind. If they do pull this scheme again, what would you do? I'll probably hold until the sight is clear for us.  # One Thing For Sure: WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER
RETARDS!! WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
Do we have a backup place to meetup if wsb gets fucked?
It ain't much, but its honest work. Holding to the grave. GME NOK AMC
I GOT FUCKED
Every stock I got SNDL NOK AAL were sabotaged and I lost tons of money ...
HOLD and BUY (GME,AMC,NOK,BB) on any platform you can
Am up awake to support the push
Currently it's 12AM here.  Just letting y'all know, I'm supporting y'all rn, for the push on GME, BB and NAKD. I'm down but I trust.
Take revenge on Robinhood
Now is the time, if you have cash in robinhood pull it out and switch to a new brokerage. A mass exodus of accounts will hurt them badly.
Why y‚Äôall sellin everything?
Stop doing that.
10:41 AND SEC HASNT DONE SHIT
Petition to change name to:
Wallstreetbeats.  I am retarded and have been reading this subreddit as wallstreetbeats for over a year, and until the massive media coverage have just realized how dumb I am. Since you guys are fucking up everyone's shit for funzies can you change your name so I can be right and everyone else in the world is wrong? Making all the media think theyve been saying it wrong would be kinda cool. Piss on me be, beat me, 2395.
Is the end of the squeeze
with now brokers taking the side of big firms is it over?

Flipping GME and AMC into NGA
NGA is merging with Lion buses.  Amazon just orderes 1,500 electric buses from them and took a 18% stake in the company.  Biden Administration wants 500k electric school buses on the road and they are one of two manufacturers.  They are expanding and building more factories and battery factories in US.
THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION BY THE WALLSTREET POWER PLAYERS!! DONT SELL AMC! BUY LOW AND KEEP TAKING THEIR MONEY. DONT LET THEM SCARE YOU. DONT LET THEM WIN.
Anyone else lost a majority of their portfolio?
Im losing a good portion of my portfolio just because brokers are blocking trades for certain stocks, how is this even legal
Why is AMC bleeding this hard. How they do that?
You retards are still holding the line or you sell your shits you week paperhands?
No coment
Where to trade GME?
New to the revolution here and loving it, but what's a good platform to trade GME on currently as it's been hidden on Robinhood so I can get in on this beautiful hit on Wall Street.
SEC Investor Complaint form link
File against your platform if it is blocking specific tickers
NOTHING HAS CHANGED! WE STILL HOLD!!! HOLDING IS WHAT FUCKS THEM. HOLD THE LINE YOU PAPER PUSSYS
Haven't used Robinhood in 3 years. Checked my account. $500 in AMD stock chilling there. Promptly sold. Deactivated my account. Bought another share of GME. FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD. I HOPE YOU LOSE ALL OF YOUR CUSTOMERS.
I might be a little late to the party, but I just BOUGHT GME and BB

Broker to buy GME
I'm new to the game, wanted to use Robinhood, but looks like they ditched GME. I'm in germany btw, would be nice if I can pay with paypal there. Thanks for the answers
AMC WAS SUSPENDED ON WEBULL
Wtf it‚Äôs suspended and left at $
Please send a complaint to the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (CA-HD18), who represents the district in California where Robinhood is headquartered. We cannot let them brush this under the rug, every single voice matters.
Every. Single. Voice. Matters.  We fall together if we stay silent, but if there's anything this saga should have taught us, it's that when we work together we are more powerful than they are. This is illegal, shameless, and malicious activity by Robinhood, especially in a pandemic.      Congresswoman Eshoo can be contacted here:      Her office can be reached at:  District Office 698 Emerson Street Palo Alto, California 94301 Telephone: (650) 323-2984 or (408) 245-2339 or (831) 335-2020 Fax: (650) 323-3498   698 Emerson Street Palo Alto, California 94301 Telephone: (650) 323-2984 or (408) 245-2339 or (831) 335-2020 Fax: (650) 323-3498	Washington,   Office 272 Cannon House Office Building Washington,   20515 Telephone: (202) 225-8104 Fax: (202) 225-8890   Do your part.
eToro just said they are not restricting market trading. unlike Robinhood
UK brothers and sisters Freetrade are still allowing GME BB AMC trading and instant account topups on iOS          to the moon
Please, switch to another platform and continue buying/holding
AMC is tanking. GME just dipped back to where it was yesterday. Hold the damn line, people. It's not hard to go somewhere else like Fidelity and keep buying. If you're in Robinhood, just hold them.
YOU CAN GET AMC ON CASHAPP
It Takes a few tries but it's super simple!
$gme final settlement
Scenario: we've successfully refused to sell GME to the point that the hedge funds lay in smoldering ruins, but the shorts must still be covered. Do the brokers come crawling to every holder, begging for a sale? Do a few big holders get taken away in black vans? Could the government step in to impose a final price for everyone?
STOP SELLING
Stop selling your shares you paper handed retards
AMC HYPE CREW. HOLDERS UNITE
Let them halt trading! Ignore these clowns! Hold your hats boys! I'm an autist and this is not financial advice.
This is what is about to go down!
AMC and GME suspended on webull
That is all for now
Robinhood is garbage
Screw Robinhood.
Make them eat each other. Robinhood, Citadel
The backlash has to be coordinated. Start pulling out all your cash and move it to brokerages which still allow you to trade any stock (Fidelity, schwab, etc.).   There is good reason that the main culprit behind the manipulation is Citadel. We have to hurt Robinhood until they come out and blame them. They made a grave mistake. WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION AND WE HAVE TO MAKE IT HURT.  Further instructions on how to report the market manipulation and put pressure on robinhood:
AMC is done for get out now or suffer
They lied to you nobody held it‚Äôs a fucking bloodbath
I THINK VIXY IS A GOOD STONK
VIXY WILL POP BECAUSE INVESTORS ARE MAD. THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE AND I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

I kicked myself in the balls by not buying GME dip
Bought at fucking $420 this morning, feel like a complete jackass. It just looked like it was going to keep rising for the morning. Guess that‚Äôs what I get for not trusting my instinct and waiting.
Why is GME falling so much? I had twice as much profit an hour ago
I've heard about what is going on. Who's the next target and what app is best?
I want in. Is Robinhood the only way to take part in this movement with you guys or are there other apps that could work?     There is something deep within me that wants to be a part of this just to say fuck you to the people who have been crushing us all under foot for decades. Idk who figured this out and who thought to bring every one together like this but your a god damn hero.
You might remember me as the $  SPY put guy: I‚Äôm ALL IN again
Fuck this manipulation. I‚Äôve blown up my account a few times. I‚Äôve lost more than I could afford. I‚Äôve bet on SNAP mooning, SPY tanking, and every other position under the sun.  One thing I‚Äôve never touched is my company stock. ‚ÄúThe 30k in my robinhood account is for fun, I still have six figures of company stock in my fidelity account.‚Äù Today that changed.  I sold all of my company stock and now have $122k in GME shares. I will die on this hill. Fuck robinhood, fuck the media, fuck the hedge funds. If all I do is cost the hedge funds a single cent per shorted share then I‚Äôve accomplished something.
To all the billionaires reading WSB
Lend us $28B so we can buy $GME, $AMC right out. Death to the shorts.
STICK TO GME AND HOLD THE DAMN LINE GUYS! DO NOT GIVE IN TO THE SCARE TACTICS! TAKE THEM FOR ALL THEY GOT!
STAY WITH GME
They won‚Äôt let us buy, HOLD   , if you can buy go all in. We will win this together
BUY THE DIP AND HOLD BB
Down 40% right now lets go lets go rocket time boys
GE is going up, invest now
Which should I invest in?
I‚Äôve got a pending order for GME but i dont think it‚Äôll go through from how quickly the prices were going up, would you suggest I try again when it cancels or go for BB or AMC
Is GME going to Zero now? Been dropping like a rock!
What happened to the rockets?
Stay strong don‚Äôt give in
GUYS WHAT ARE U DOING KEEP BUYING GME AND BB SHARES
AMC and NOK
Why're they both going down in price? Does it have to do with brokers not allowing them to be traded?
Need a serious reason why I shouldn‚Äôt sell right now
title. also give me a reason to sell. a bunch of major services have stopped the purchase of stocks, and while there are a bunch of other options, the majority of those who were buying stock no longer can.    price is falling fast, getting very scary
Various brokerages have stopped allowing people to buy $GME. This is blatant market manipulation, spread the news
Fuck Robinhood
Need a new place to buy either Blackberry or Nokia go to trading212
AG (Precious Metals) is the next one
AG has been manipulated far too long by JP morgan chase.   I like this stock. It has great value hedging against inflation.
Where can I buy more GME stocks fuck Robinhood
If you‚Äôve watched the Big Short, we are at the moment when Burry is being badgered by his fund to sell and Steve Carrel is grilling the credit rating agencies for not changing their ratings
HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. THIS IS OUR MOVIE.     (   )/   = valhalla
Can somebody kiss my ouchie ü§ï
Brokers who allow GME Trades:
We need a list of brokers who allow trading. I was able to buy more on Vanguard today. This shit is going to 1000 by Friday so I‚Äôm loading up.   VANGUARD
Bought in. Keep going retards.
How is this not market manipulation from robinhood? I lost 80% call value.
I   could I not lose my money? They let me sell but nobody can buy. In other   call has no way to make money so I lose everything? I don't see how that isn't manipulating the stock value and intentionally losing me money...
We need a list of which apps andbrokers are halting our stock trades
This is so that our members and future members know which to stay away from.  When things settle down, we move our hard earned money out of those accounts so they don‚Äôt get a dime from us.
Make AMC Rebound
Okay, guys, I bought 1000 shares of AMC this morning at $  If you guys could stick to the plan, that would be great.
I‚Äôm a failure. I let you all down
Fuck this Robinhood app, fuck this bullshit. Fuck the hedge funds fuck all of this restrictions. I was here and bought this stock at 30 dollars a share. I held it all the way until this morning. I was pressure by my family to sell since I gained a lot. I didn‚Äôt budge. But when the stock dropped I pulled a bitch move and dropped out. I failed you all. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm a truly a retard.
THEYRE TRYING TO SCARE US HOLD THE FUCKING LINE
Cancel robinhood gold, leave your review of your opinion of them, and find another brokerage. What are some other recommendations?
Do you think the hedgefunders are reselling the stocks they have bought at a lower price to shorten or deflate the price again
I think most people are holding the line and this is my theory
IT'S WORKING: Several Hedge Funds Stung by Market Turmoil
More hedge funds are being hit by losses o the recent market turmoil. Traders say the pain that has afflicted top hedge funds Melvin Capital Management and Maplelane Capital in recent days is spreading, as an increasing number of stocks with significant short interest surge and as funds dealing with losses pull back their exposure to the stock market on both the long and short sides of their portfolios. That means funds are getting hurt even on previously profitable bets on companies as those share prices fall. Candlestick Capital Management, a roughly $3 billion Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund started by former Citadel portfolio manager Jack Woodruff, was down in the low-to-mid-teens for the year through Wednesday, said a person familiar with the fund. It was up 26% in 2020, its first year.    D1 Capital Partners, a top-performing fund in recent years founded by former Viking Global investment chief Dan Sundheim, was down about 20% for the year through Wednesday. Its substantial portfolio of investments in private companies has buffered the fund from a bigger loss. D1 managed $20 billion at the start of the year. Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, which together with Citadel and its partners injected $  billion in emergency financing into Melvin Monday, was down about 10% for the year through earlier this week and suffered losses Tuesday and Wednesday, said people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News was first to report the performances of D1 Capital and Point72. Some funds that have sustained severe losses are seeking influxes of cash to help stabilize their firms.    Maplelane, which started the year with about $  billion and was down roughly 30% for the year through Tuesday, sustained additional losses that saw it down about 45% for the year through Wednesday, said people familiar with the fund. One of the people said the losses Wednesday stemmed from degrossing, or cutting back its exposure to the stock market. That included reducing position sizes and exiting names to limit losses. Maplelane is a low-profile hedge fund that has rarely marketed to investors in the past. But it has discussed raising between $300 million and $500 million with potential clients, said people familiar with the fund. The losses have come during a period of frenetic trading, with shares of companies such as GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. shooting wildly higher. Individual investors have claimed victory for the violent moves unmoored from the underlying fundamentals of companies. The rising prices have prompted bearish investors to buy back shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still.
Hold the line DOGEBOYS

Take a look at this stock TPRFF or   on the canadian side, the float is only 50M shares, they mine gold and silver in Columbia and give back to their community of poor citizens in the region. They produce over 200,000 oz per year and their market cap is only 300M they have almost 100M in cash alone!!! The graph shows they used to be over $300 many years ago this stock could fly!!! No one is even paying attention to this one, this stock actually has value and with the run up on silver and gold this miner can   to the moon!!!! What say you?
HOLD. THE. LINE.

WE CAUSED THIS... any their fear mongering tactics WILL NOT FUCK IS UP. Hold everything and we will achieve the salvation we wanted. Go to fidelity if you‚Äôre a full retard and will help the cause. I am not a financial advisor btw so up to you if you want to listen. This is straight up war against the corrupt asses these billionaires are... the lemon May have gotten a bit harder BUT WE WILL FUCKING SQUEEZE IT NO MATTER WHAT. All I beg of you is to hold (not financial advice). See you in Valhalla and I hope to god if anyone from Robinhood, CNBC, CNN, Melvin Captital, Citron research, Citadel, Point72, and all corrupt bitches behind the scenes are reading this...

What can I do to trade? What other investment apps or sites are out there that I can use?! Help Needed!
Use Webull, they have not blocked trading.
ROBINHOOD'S APP STORE RATING IS TOO HIGH. Don't you think?
We don't like the app!!
How Important it is to work together, and not back down.
GME shows our potential. If we say "go with X, Y, and Z", and we don't all push together - then we will fall as we push in all directions trying to get off the titanic together. But this is not the titanic if we don't let it become that. We are a motherfucking planet and we are going to blast through the universe in a way that we've never seen before. Buy. Hold. Remember the game plan is longer-term than 1 day market scares by the big corporate elites. We number in the MILLIONS now. We are a force to be reckoned with. Stay strong. Hold. And fuck it - let's start PUSHING THIS MOTHERFUCKER FURTHER.

Transfer to Firstrade?
Has anybody done this?  How long will it take & will it liquidate my account (options & stocks) and rebuy them?
Rules for thee, not for me
Robin Hood was targeted specifically because of Wall Street bets places trades there. We are witnessing a major attack from a place we thought of as home.  Nonetheless, we will migrate to where the people can place trades completely free without being censored by startups funded by hedge funds.   The dip you experience this AM was most likely due to this pre determined attack on the platform we use to trade. Absolutely illegal, but I‚Äôm sure the SEC will oversee it?  Glad it‚Äôs so apparent now, we will not forget our allies on this class warfare.   We are witnessing the greatest battle of our lifetime and the wealthiest and greediest people are getting a taste of their own medicine for what we went through in 08‚Äô   It‚Äôs time for them to experience a recession and stop profiting from businesses that they decided should fail.
Canada Still Trading

Trying to buy more gamestock, but Fidelity, ETrade, and TD Ameritrade all failed me :( ( )
Since Robinhood is just plain market manipulating, I tried to sign up for TD Ameritrade, ETrade, and Fidelity. Etrade just dies, Ameritrade said it's 2-4 days until my account can be used, and Fidelity won't let me transfer funds. Why is this so difficult? I need advice.

Is Webull Bust now Too?
I am trying to signup on the Webull app and it won't allow me to open an account. When I tap the 'Open Account' button nothing happens.
New Poster, NGL, I've kinda got the jitters here
Hey guys, am I right to have the jitters here? It seems really low/not accelerating as quickly as I thought it was going to - am I right to be worried?
They've shot themselves in the foot
Why did they think its a good idea to stop people buying GME?   They have attracted a lot more attention to it and when they do lift the stop (I assume they have to at some point right?) There will simply be a tidal wave of buys. There is no way out for them now.  If they had left it and kept it a bit more quiet it perhaps wouldn't have been so bad.           oh, nearly   THE MOON!! HOLD!!!!        etc.
Buy on CashApp $AMC $NOK $BB
People forget you can trade on cashapp too and all stonks are available except gme
Now is the best time to buy GME because any potential losses are going to be mitigated by the class action lawsuits.
If you have been watching from the sidelines. (like me) You should go ahead and try to buy a share or two just so you can be a part of the class action lawsuits that are coming. Robinhood, Ameritrade and others are blocking action on GME now. There will be fallout from their decisions to do this.  Maybe GME goes up maybe it goes down, but these companies are backed by deep pockets, are certain to be sued into oblivion and if you do lose money your losses will be mitigated by the wave of coming lawsuits.
Why are BB and AMC going down?
Just a reminder, the best way to practice how to deal with Robinhood execs
REMEMBER THE GME DROP? HOLD IT LIKE YOU HOLD IT BACK THEN NOK BB AMC GME
Dodge dodge dodge!
Dodge the manipulators and flood dodge     let‚Äôs make what we can move move to the moon moon

GS2C (GameStop EU) can still be bought and is dipping!
They may have blocked GameStop, but the EU GameStop is still possible to purchase, and has just dipped to ‚Ç¨300!!   I'm not here to give financial advice, but it's following GME happily.
SPCE dip
????? what the fuck is going on
Where can you buy GME from Europe ?
T212 won't let you anymore, anyone knows ?
Us AMC and BB investors have lost money. If you have GME you better hold the F  +  Line and stick it to these mother F+   .
You guys are the true hero‚Äôs. You‚Äôre holding the line like the baddest soldiers there are. They screwed us over on AMC and BB but just watching you guys with diamond hands has brought me to tears. HOLD THAT LINE BOYS AND NEVER GIVE UP. It‚Äôs not about the money anymore. It‚Äôs about our every day lives. We will not suffer anymore.
Moving on from Robinhood
I stuck around after their crashes about a year ago because I was too lazy to look for something else. I gave them the benefit of the doubt during that situation, but making a mistake is different then intentionally blocking free trade because you have an agenda.   I sold everything besides GME and I‚Äôm looking where to go next. Any recommendations? Obviously I got my wife‚Äôs boyfriends permission to go to anywhere that isn‚Äôt currently blocking the purchase of GME
Robinhood blocked not just GME, but also BB, AMC, and NOK
AMC giving me anxiety
Someone calm me down lol
I lost money because of Robinhood this morning ... it ain‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs hard-earned money, and the big boy billionaires are ganging up on us to take our pennies. Not sure who they‚Äôre trying to fool by ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù us from volatility. I DONT FEEL PROTECTED
I'm disgusted with Robinhood's behavior
This is blatant market manipulation and they're not going to have any repercussions for it. Fuck them, I'm done. For the people my ass.
What a load of BULL.
My first stock purchase ever.
Market MANIPULATION by Robinhood today needs to be Investigated. Call your CONGRESSIONAL REP OFFICE TODAY TO COMPLAIN. Lawmakers must put an end to this type of illegal market manipulation!
I‚Äôm totally ignorant with what‚Äôs going on. Can someone explain? If everyone buys stocks for them to go up‚Äî don‚Äôt they have to sell them back to get money back? So what‚Äôs the difference in this and the hedge funds that have to sell them as well? I‚Äôm lost lol
Trading212 doesn't allow new GME buy positions anymore. I'm closing my account with them.
NOKIA IS 5G PLAY AND BB IS AI AND CYBERSERCURITY. THESE ARE 2 LARGEST SECTOR GOING FORWARD.
This is why we hold, this is what the hedgefund doesn't care. But we do!   Also motley fools report told me to invest in these 2 techs this years specifically for gains.
THE GME AND AMC DIPS ARE A GODSEND BUY MORE
FUCK THE RICH
Got 1 share in at $400 through Merrill before they started blocking. My first stock ever. Tell me how to feel!
Did I make a huge mistake? I'm feeling funny
Robinhood & Webull as well as most other retail trading sites blocking us out from buying any of the stocks we want. This should be absolutely illegal, it‚Äôs tantamount to collusion, price fixing, and insider trading. Begging all of you that were able to get in to hold on. Make. Them. Pay.
STOP SELLING, START THE ENGINES!
DON'T SELL GME, DON'T SELL BB, DON'T SELL NOKIA! WE NEED TO HOLD, DON'T SELL JUST BECAUSE IT IS FALLING RIGHT NOW. BUY AND HOLD BECAUSE THE ROCKETS ARE GONNA START AGAIN SOON
BREAKING: Robinhood announces that they will not list their own stock post-IPO
Can anyone trade with Schwab right now? I seem to be blocked from doing so.
For reference, I finally got some money in it and did some overnight trading and received my BB shares, but in the morning they wouldn't let me buy more even with an appropriate amount of funds in my investment portfolio. This is a new account (maybe a week or two old), not sure if that is relevant.
THEY REMOVED DODGECOIN FROM ROBINHOOD CAN THEY DO THAT ü•µ
I'm Done with Robinhood need new Brokers
After 3 years of sticking by this bullshit buggy crap inferior broker, this was my last straw. Not when they stole $10k in options from me because of "bugs" and gave me $20 but when falsely market themselves as the people's brokers. I urge you guys to change up your brokerages as well so Robinhood really knows who they should be protecting.      That being said any recommendations? No Webull its a Chinese app.  HOLD GME
GameStop up on webull
Buy now

Any ideas?
You degens just got pumped and dumped with AMC. What happened to hold the line? Cowards.
Any other 1 stock owners feeling giddy over the message being sent to the fat cats?
I for one can't afford to buy more than one stock at the moment. I'm absolutely in love with the movement and hope my and all the other little contributions make a difference over all.     Fuck Wall Street.  Fuck that 1%.  Fuck loop holes in the law.  Fuck the political divide.     For every Millennial, Gen Z and Gen X - this is our time to send a fuck you to the overlords.     I like this stock. GME was many of our childhoods and is more than just a marker for our generation.

WE NEED TO HOLD PAST FRIDAY, UNTIL NEXT WEEK
I saw a different post that definitely summed it up better than I will but it got lost in the feed.  WE CANT SELL FRIDAY. FRIDAY IS THE BEGINING OF THE END. If we close on Friday above $115 then the options close and Melvin or whoever is in charge has to provide those shares back to the people who closed on their options, which will increase the price. This imo will be enough of a rise in price to get the bad guys on wall street to start to close their short position. THIS WILL TAKE DAYS. They got so many short positions that covering all of them will take DAYS. Again, the other post I saw definitely said it better but I couldn't find it this morning so I thought id try to get the new out there.  The middle/end of NEXT WEEK is the time to sell. The short cover ratio or smt. Please upvote so that everyone on this subreddit can see (If u are a CNBC or Wallstreet keep scrolling)     DONT SELL FRIDAY HOLD.                        This is not financial advice. I like the stock.

Robinhood sucks, but we can keep fighting the system. Don‚Äôt let these assholes get you down when there are ways around them
I use Charles Schwab for my trades and I can buy GME, BB, AMC, and all these other companies getting fucked by the hedge fund assholes. All trading is free on there too. There‚Äôs also TD Ameritrade, Etrade, and many other financial institutions that aren‚Äôt panicking at our newfound power.   I feel for all my fellow autists with cash stuck on Robonhood right now. That fucking sucks. But they‚Äôre using this as a fear tactic to put an end to our run. If you‚Äôre still game, get in using another trade platform and let‚Äôs get these companies to the moon!
Send $SLV to the moon. I've just bought.
With TD Ameritrade cock blocking me on $GME, $NOK, and $AMC, I've put my sights on $SLV.   Let's send it soaring!
A sign from my broker that they're RUNNING SHIT SCARED right now. Come on GME
My broker's platform is more stable than retail brokers (they count hedge funds as clients too so the platform's geared up for institutional trading). And you know how I know shit's raining down on the shortsellers right now?   The platform's not even letting me log in 9 times out of 10. When I'm finally in, it kicks me out within minutes, probably because the server can't handle the load. This only ever happened in the past during flash market crashes because all their clients, including the hedge funds, were scrambling to get in trying to sort out their positions.  I take it as a very positive sign. I was 100% sure going into today but now I'm 1000% sure, if that's even possible: no way I'm selling my GME shares now.
Which one do I buy
I just got a job now which ones do I buy bois(16 year old with no bills) so i can buy   in 2 weeks
Is it a good idea to invest in covid vaccine manufacturers?
I know it‚Äôs not GME so this will probably get buried, but I was wondering if I missed the train on covid vaccine stocks. I know Moderna did really well, but at the same time Pfizer stock is almost exactly where it was a whole year ago. So I‚Äôm just not sure if it‚Äôs worth investing in, or if I‚Äôm just too late or what
Manipulation done by the Mass Media
Today is one of those unique days when you can see the working of the mass media's propaganda machine in full action, shining bright, burning their 'news' into your mind about the happenings around GME.  Probably you know most of this already, but it's so perfectly adds up today, I just have to post it.      The US media, which  . Their own and their buddies interest will come first. They get the reports, 'expert opinions' from the same biased sources. The news anchors, journalists  are happily reporting these at face value, because in order to have any meaningful position at a big media company, the corporate mindset have to be ingrained in you.   In the news today the common enemies are:     dumb money   alt-right leaning investor groups on reddit   reckless retail investors causing systemic risks  If for some reason a silly journalist or news site would report something else, they would get flaked. The other big players in the media would discredit their story and sources, they would portray them incompetent, irresponsible or uninformed. The unbiased journalist is sidelined, and the news site lose advertising revenue because of their anti-corporate mindset.     The manipulation will continue in the coming days until the GME issue settles. After that depending to the results, the story will be either completely forgotten by the media as it would never happened, or it will stay as a cautionary tale about the 'dangers' posed by the actions of the 'common enemies' above, advocating for stricter regulations in order to prevent these reckless, horrible things in the future.

Petition to End Robinhood's Blatant Market Manipulation
We need to rise against the blatant manipulation on RH (Emails + Class Action Suit)
In light of what's happening on Robinhood, everyone please email them this so they know what they're getting into.         "Dear Robinhood,    You claim your platform's name is Robinhood. But you're actually just Robbin hood. I can't even begin to discuss how disgusting this is. I understand you want to IPO and suck up to these hedge funds but you are obviously blatantly manipulating the market. I can't even begin to express how ridiculous this is, manipulating FREE trade. This brokerage was a joke to begin with but we used you because it was easy and had a cult following. I just want to say, here is a big fuck you for making me lose most of my money. We will ALL collectively file a class action suit. We will ALL leave to other platforms. We will ALL short the shit out of your stock when you IPO. We will NOT stop. We will keep fucking buying GameStop as we please.       Can't stop. Won't stop. Game Stop.    Power to the People."      Then we need to form a coalition on WSB so we can legitimately hire one of the best lawyers and file a class action lawsuit for all the lost money in our stocks we couldn't trade.  Who's with me?    This is a revolution. I am so livid but think acting on it is better than them putting us down.
GME no supported by robinhood and dropping fast, HOLD YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS!!!
WHAT THE FUCK- why can‚Äôt I buy BB. So fucked.
Robinhood stops BB, NOK, GME, AMC buys. End result: hedge funds get some money back, Citadel gave Robinhood enough funds to cover the future class action lawsuit, SEC investigation, and still make a profit. And the individuals like us take on the losses
We just hit the boss battle of the    game. Let's finish what we started
They're holding us down from buying, but we can hold. And we can exercise calls. So many expiring calls at the end of the week. Squeeze. You held through WSB going down, you can hold for another few days.   Finish what we started.

What happens if the Hedge Funds go bankrupt?
Hey. I'm not a regular here. I don't make bets or invest in stocks. I'm not riding GME to the moon with all you hero's. I'm just a guy watching this show with some questions. Mainly, what happens if no one can buy the now highly inflated GME stocks?   Everyone is acting as though the Hedge Funds who have shorted GME have no other choice than to buy back GME stocks at $69,420. But there is definitely a finite limit to the amount of money they can access to purchase stocks. What is to prevent these Orgs from declaring bankruptcy and defaulting on the debt? And if that were to happen, why is the little guy not left holding the bag once again, having invested his life savings in an over inflated stock that no one is now required to buy?  I'm sure there are good answers to these concerns, and that I'm simply uneducated on the subject, but I'd love if someone could address these issues for me.
Call your Congressperson or Senator
MODS Please do not remove, this is the way.  Don't let them get away with this. We the Retards need to use our actual right to assembly to make real change. We proved the game is rigged now let's bring it home. Let's make some real change.   Collective power isn't limited to wall street.     You're locked out of robinhood? Don't sell and Call your Senator.     They froze trading? Don't sell and Call your Congressperson.     Explain to the polite intern who answers what is happening in a calm reasonable voice. Explain that it is wall street who is acting irresponsibly. That wall street was stuck in a bad trade and wall street changed the rules to ensure they always finish on top. Remind them that the US Government bailed out the banks in 2008 and left our parents out to dry. If they want us to believe the system still works there should be investigations into citadel and robinhood. This is untenable.   I have time, if you have time, keep calling until they do something. If we do nothing they will side with the banks again. Send them a post card, send them an email, call them a 7th time.  Find your representative and senators contact info here:

BUILDING NEW TRADING PLATFORM.
PLEASE UPVOTE IF YOU ARE ON BOARD.   Hey all. I couldn‚Äôt say how proud I am of these last couple of days. It has absolutely made me so happy to see this revolution on Wall Street.  With everything happening in Robinhood re: GME, AMC, and more, including other trading apps, it occurred to me that it‚Äôs probably time to bring a new platform to market. One that supports healthy news flow, has a social forum like this, with as little to no restriction as possible.   One that reflects and truly supports the ‚Äòmain street‚Äô traders instead of Wall Street traders.   No blocked buys.  No cancelling orders without permission.  No working with and for hedge funds on the back end.   I‚Äôm in the process of getting my team together to build this.   Is this something you would want?   I will keep tabs on this post and thread with updates and anything that we move forward with. Will most likely launch a kickstarter to help this thing get off the ground completely and swiftly.   Even if you don‚Äôt want this, your upvote will help us tremendously. Thank you! Let‚Äôs continue this wave of change!

Since we have some downtime to just watch, I wanted to talk to you all about the Supreme Court decision of      You can read the details, so let me be direct - this case is important because it establishes that political contributions on behalf of corporations fall under the first amendment, as they are a form of protected speech.  Sounds pretty backwards? Yeah, because it is, but its important today because it limits what control the government can exercise in how you spend your money.    Things are a little different with the SEC, but why? If a corporation is a person, and they can make a contribution as they see fit, why can't an individual decide when to buy or sell stock.    Before you Reeeeeee,  apps aren't government. But government intervention walks a thin line with this ruling. I always hated this case,  but since we've exploited a shitty loophole they created,  why can't we protect it with more shitty logic they created for themselves?    Thoughts? Any lawyers want to weigh in?
Honestly if u are selling then good for me
Everyone selling GME, BB, AMC then we‚Äôll done for selling ur ticket to the moon :)
Petition to Censor Robinhood
The title makes it pretty self explanatory. We should censor Robinhood for screwing us over by not allowing any posts with screenshots of RH. This would send a clear message to them, and other brokerages. It would also encourage community's members to switch to another platform
AMC & GME
BUY BB AT THE DIP
I‚Äôm in on BB let‚Äôs get it perfect time to go jn
EVERYONE KEEP TRACK OF THE AMOUNT OF SHARES YOU HAVE
Take screenshots. Write down the numbers down on paper. Do it again after every time you buy or sell. You don't have to do it here, but make sure you keep the numbers somewhere.  I'm not saying this is definitely going to happen (in fact, I'm pretty sure it won't), but there's a non-zero chance that the apps you're using might begin to alter your quantity of shares without permission now that hiding certain stocks isn't working. In the worst-case scenario, it's better to have too much evidence than not enough.
‚ÄúThis stock is not supported on Robinhood‚Äù
UK here, on Trading 212, can't buy?
Anyone else having issues buying $GME, $AMC, $BB, $NOK, etc? Are we being restricted access to free markets? How/why?
WSB what are your thoughts on BB
Look I know you guys are busy with GME right now and I love it. I have been along time reader of the forum but was not a believer in stock hitting these numbers. I am a retard though so I know all is forgiven. As for BB I know its going to moon but, I feel like it's going to be in the long run. Since i am in fact a retard I only know one thing is for sure, Buy dip, never sell. Can I have a head retard explain to me why this is the right thing to do?
Fuck Robinhood, let‚Äôs destroy them
Steal from the poor, give to the rich
Robbing Hood. As a fellow Canadian, I got your backs.  GME
GME ON SALE BOYS, NOW TO THE MOON
ALL YOUR LOCAL NEWS NETWORK AND MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD! THIS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY! THE FREE MARKET IS UNDER ATTACK!
UPVOTE THIS AND BE HEARD!!
Whatever you purchased, don‚Äôt worry about the current prices. Hold.
If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.   Because platforms are limiting the ability to purchase, it‚Äôs driving the price down. Once they open the doors back up, the prices will still be low. The appeal to purchase will be there, and you can expect a return.   So whatever you bought, legggggo
I just put $100 into GME!!
Very excited, used ameritrade instead of robinhood so I don‚Äôt get screwed over
Did everyone forget about PLTR? This was a call and is not currently blocked.
Petition to rename ROBINHOOD.
They are taking from us and giving it back to the rich! Fuck 'em.
Can still buy BB on Plus500
They're limiting the shares you can buy to about 50 but its possible.  Just thought I'd share this and say I love what you fucking maniacs are doing.
I would rather sink with the ship than take my profits and let them drive the price down
I used to be a gay bear.  Like, I still am, but I used to   bought in to GME to make a quick buck off of the   I won't lie, it also helped that I have nostalgia for   way, I was planning on being a leech, nothing more.  Then the articles and bullshit   are a bunch of institutional traders making a terrible short, and the retail investor punishing it.Everyday traders have been used and abused to the benefit of market movers for years.  So many years of politically-motivated low interest rates have punished savers, and forced the everyman to put all of their money in the market which ultimately benefits the upper class.  The alternative? What alternative? When the basics of a middle class life (a house, an education) have also been driven up tenfold in cost because of the same low interest rates? We aren't doing this for greed, we're doing this to meet our basic needs.  Of course, now that the everyman is in control, the institutions begin to cry foul and scream about a bubble.  Cuz NOW it's a bubble. NOW it's unfair. Only when we win do the rules need to change.  Kings and queens, they want us to be discouraged, to sell and take our profits and stop bothering them. Well I am no longer here to make a short term profit. I will not sell. I am here to send a message.     That message? Read the first letter of every line above.    I LIKE THIS S T O C K      It ain't much, but please join me:    Seriously though. Billionaires made 931 billion last year while we all suffered. How often do you get to flip off the ruling class, participate in a generational short squeeze, and invest in such a beautiful fucking company???
HOLD AND BUY THE DIP. ANYONE WHO'S PANICKING AS THE PRICES ARE DROPPING FEAR NOT! This is just the beginning. MORE GME, MORE AMC. DON'T LET THEM SUITS WIN. DIAMOND HANDS GANG
65k reinforcements coming in from /r/enlightenedbirdmen. This moment is historic
They hate the people on wall street as much as the rest of you and want to see GME go to the moon. Every solider counts. GME to the Moon NO ONE FUCKING SELL.
Next GME?
GUYS so GME got banned on multiple brokerages. THE NEXT MOST HEAVILY SHORTED STOCK IS $MAC. 50%+ short interest float. GET IN ON MAC!
DO NOT SELL! HOLD THE LINE YOU APES!!
Do not succumb to the scare tactics of the elites! IF WE DO NOT SELL, WE WIN!! Let's take this to fucking ANDROMEDA!!!!!
Robinhood locked gme
Is there still a way to get in on this?
GME OPEN ON
BUYING $AG, FELLOW RETARDS
Poor college graduate here, being fucked over by the system as usual. I've been reading up a lot on physicals recently, silver and gold and such. Banks and other financial institutions have historically suppressed these assets and as I understand it, many who have been in the game for a while see the market manipulation often. I feel that the whole GME and AMC thing is really good, and highlights the obscene flaws in our financial system. And physicals, such as silver, have the potential to go to the thousands.   As daddy Elon once said, if you're young and have nothing to lose, take that risk. This is me spending my last $1k on $AG. FUCK IT.   Am I autistic? Probably. But fuck me sideways if I'm not going to fight the clear billshit going on right now
GME!!! BUY THE DIP
This post made by the"not a financial advisor" gang
What can folks with little experience do right now?
lol m seeing a lot of discussion amongst folks who seem to know what they‚Äôre talking about but not a lot of info for noobs. Let me put it into perspective, I have no stocks and have never invested. I‚Äôm an early 30s bartender with massive student debt. I‚Äôve got $800 that, if it disappeared I could still survive without. What can/should I do?

MFs better stay the course.  Go Go Go
Alright retards.. .you usually have 2 choices, buy and sell. They've simplified things for you, now if you want to make money, you have NO choices. Hold the line retards
What can be done, legally? I placed an order 6 hours before the bell. At 9 minutes before opening, RH's in-app messaging says my order was canceled.
And it says that I canceled it.  GME opened at 240 and right now it's ~$400.  I am livid.  There has to be consequences for my lost
ROBINHOOD IS ONLY ROBIN' THEMSELVES - GME
Some people say Robinhood - by disallowing users to buy additional shares in GME and other short-interest stocks - are shooting themselves in the foot.   I disagree. Instead they tried to grab the rocket with their bare paper hands in a futile attempt to prevent it from taking off with T-minus 7 seconds until lift-off. While very unfortunate, their eventual incineration will be swift.      PAPER BEATS ROCK / ROCK BEATS SCISSORS / SCISSORS BEAT PAPER  NOTHING BEATS ROCKET   GME +340 @ $63       RIDE OR DIE
We have stayed inside the current trend since Friday. Stay strong! (5m chart w/ Pitchfork)

Hedge funds should buy GME shares to help cover their short losses
I heard GME is where the smart money is today.
If anyone‚Äôs curious FORD has a 43B cap with only 15M in right now.
AMC down to $
What's going on? Time to buy and hold?  Edit:$  now
DON'T LET ROBINHOOD BECOME THE SCAPEGOAT. This goes deeper -- CITADEL fulfills most of Robinhoods orders. THEY ARE THE ONES CANCELLING WSB.
What‚Äôs next after GME? EAF looks pretty cool.
What‚Äôs the next big gain? The next big thing? I suggest GrafTech International Ltd. I‚Äôm willing to bet the bets are against them.  Edit: In case I‚Äôm wrong, please tell call me out. I‚Äôm looking for good future investments that could be go down the same route as GME.
The shorts are way over their skis on Macy‚Äôs! ‚õ∑ Why does anyone think BBY is better??

RH and PDT rule should be examined. They are blocking us from earnings some $$$
While all this is going on we need to speak up and put companies like RH accountable. Also, how about adjusting or removing the PDT limit for us little guys.
STOP SELLING AMC!!!
Buy AMC it is dipped below 10 a stock
Can we get some honest devs to make a new Robinhood without the BS Please!
$GME & $AMC - 0 or 3x return, nothing in between!
These halts and the subsequence sell-offs are playing right into their hands.  Aren't we all saying that we are putting in what we are willing to lose?   LOSE IT IF NECESSARY, DO NOT SELL   Obviously do whatever you want, I am no financial advisor, but I am seeing this as a historical event. I will take the hit if these stocks go to 0, otherwise I'm HODLING as a statement.   This is not an investment decision- it's the REAL version of occupy wallst. Occupying the streets? They don't care... there's police and they can stay in their building  Occupy their own playground though (stonks)... well... you've seen the POWER in that over the last few days.   I'm going for 0 or 3x return- NOTHING IN BETWEEN.
They've blocked BB too! Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

How does one permanently delete their Robinhood account?

THE HIGHEST PRESSURES CREATE THE GREATEST DIAMONDS
Robinhood is fucked I‚Äôm a noob, does anyone know of a good trading platform that does instant initial bank transfers without a few days of waiting period?
As I‚Äôm sure you all already know robinhood no longer is allowing users to buy NOK, BB, or AMC which is bogus as fuck. I need a new trading platform and preferably one that won‚Äôt take days to initially link my bank account (like E TRADE and SoFi does). Any recommendations would be very appreciated!
Obalon
Obalon therapeutics is seems like a good buy. Many people would like to not be fat anymore. So i suggest buying it
Can't believe what RH is doing. How can they expect to stay in business?
I don't even fucking use RH.    I'm a geezer and use Ameritrade.  Looks I can still buy GME on TD if I want (for now).  Cannot fucking believe RH is pulling this shit.  I feel for all of you with RH.  Hope you can jump to another platform and fuck RH to hell!
Fuck Robinhood in the ass
I need more GME, I‚Äôm broke but I‚Äôm also trying to invest the last few hundred dollars, everything I‚Äôve got, into GME and fucking ROBINHOOD canceled the order I placed after close and wont allow me to buy SHIT.  Where can small time retard like me buy some GME RIGHT NOW??????

Naked Call Writing: A High Risk Options Strategy
Naked Call Writing: A High Risk Options Strategy     A naked call position can have disastrous consequences since a security¬†can theoretically rise to infinity.¬†     The writer of a naked call is at risk of realizing unlimited losses because, theoretically, there is no limit to how high a stock's price can go.
WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO WINNING
All of this is just a scare tactic. They are trying to shut us down, they won't allow us to buy GME because they know we are that close.  Just imagine, Robinhood just lost all their credibility and millions of users, and you know why they did that? Because the big suits know they are losing and they can still lose so much more. They are trying to do everything they can to stop us.  Too bad for them we are autists. Too bad for them we remain retards more than they can remain solvent. Too bad for them Robinhood and 212 are just a drop against this tidal wave of apes buying GME.  WE HOLD. GME TO THE MOON           This is not investiment advice. We like this stock.
Other brokers with no fees - fuck RH

NAKD, NOK, and BB unavailable on RH. WHATEVER YOU GOT, HOLD IT!!!
BB is super low rn, we need to but it and have it rise
Currently at   if people buy it and hold its going to mars. And don't forget, HOLD

I‚Äôve heard reports of stock brokers and people being threatened. That‚Äôs bad. Don‚Äôt do it. If that happens, public opinion will turn from grassroots to a bunch of angry idiots in a flash.

Hi guys first I want to congratulate you for what you are doing you are changing the market!!  I wanna salute our keep u/DeepFuckingValue for his incredible mind.  For those who are on GME please don't sell HOLD   STAY IN.  And for those who can't afford to enter now in GME let's go for BB   THEY THOUGHT THEY CONTROLLED THE SYSTEM!   WE ARE THE FUCKING SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yo Robinhood, explain how intentionally tanking a stock‚Äôs price that millions of your young, low income customers have put their money into is ‚Äúprotecting them‚Äù
Seriously you motherfuckers will be sued into oblivion for this if you don‚Äôt reverse course right now. Traders don‚Äôt need your ‚Äúprotection‚Äù, the ‚ÄúFrEe MaRkEt‚Äù will balance it‚Äôs shit out once we‚Äôre done taking a few billion from your hedge fund buddies.  Volatility is a part of the market. These stocks weren‚Äôt going to run forever you stupid assholes.   You took the faith of people who trusted you and stepped on it.
Couldn't even complete my order to buy since YESTERDAY. Can someone say MARKET MANUPULATION???
Reviews not going through on iPhone but going through on Android, is apple and robinhood in cahoots?!
Robinhood Blocks Buying of AMC & GameStop
Robinhood isn‚Äôt allowing anyone to buy these shares and the SEC is looking into both of the companies. They are all upset that the prices were controlled by the people.   They are trying to TAKE our voice away!  Let‚Äôs show them it can‚Äôt happen!  Move onto other stocks. Let‚Äôs repeat AMC and GameStop.   Based on different Reddit threads it seems that NAKD and CTRM are the popular choices. I bought some this morning. You should too!  Express our voice!

I propose we ban screenshots from Robinhood in WSB... That‚Äôs a great way we can fight back.
How much free advertising has this company received thanks to WSB over the years?  People post Robinhood screenshots of their six figure gains here all the time, and they‚Äôve enjoyed that exposure free of cost while it‚Äôs probably more effective than a super bowl ad. If WSB put a ban on screenshots from their app, and makes the anti-Robinhood   go viral like with the $GME short squeeze, they would not be able to ignore it.   Same goes for all the brokerages who delisted GME/AMC/BB/NAKD/etc
Is there any merit behind buying NOK?
I know it‚Äôs different than the movement behind GME - but are there any similarities? Or is it just momentum siphoning off GameStop?  Full disclosure, I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about. I do have some shares in NOK.
Do these fully grown adults not understand that we're trying to make some money?
Like do they not? Some of us got bills to pay and food to put on the table and these wall street hedge fund nerds think we treat this like a joke. Some people are still suffering financially due to the whole pandemic.    These petty dudes gotta stop messing with people's money.
Feels like the establishment is fighting back
This could become a war of attrition. Who backs down first. Goliath or the army of David‚Äôs? ü§î
This is cheesy as hell but WSB has given me hope for humanity.
First off, let me state that I was an initial naysayer about GME, I don't even own any stocks because I'm not brave enough. But I've been watching, and I've seen how things have gone, how people have been posting and dealt with. There are occasional bad actors within this community that ARE going to try and take advantage of the rest of you, but the majority aren't like that and are doing a good thing, separate but together.  The hope for humanity part comes in where game theory ends. For those who don't know, part of game theory involves the prisoner's dilemma, which could be easily adapted to apply to the GME stock situation. In the prisoner's dilemma, two partners in crime are offered the option to betray one another. Each of you has two options, to talk or to stay silent. If both of you talk, you both get a moderate amount of prison time. If only one of you talks, they get off and the other gets heavy prison time. If neither talk, you both get minor prison time, the total of which is less than either one of you going to prison on their own. So in this situation, the choice that's best for the group is to stay silent, as if you both stay silent, your total prison time ends up less than either one of you going on their own, and certainly is less than if you both betray eachother. However, most of the time this kind of situation (with different scenarios), where people are given a choice between acting in a way that's right for themselves if others also act that way and acting in a way that's only right for themselves if nobody else acts that way, they choose the latter, or in the prisoner's dilemma, they choose to betray their partner. This is because most people feel that their partner will betray them anyway so they might as well act to minimize their own prison time and hey if the partner doesn't betray them, they get the best possible option for only themselves.  The problem with this kind of thinking is that is ends up with everybody losing out on what could be a better situation for everybody because of the inherent selfishness of humankind. Overcoming this kind of thinking is how we may press forward as a society and advance beyond our own selfishness.  I've seen the gains a lot of you have made and you're all in an enhanced collective prisoner's dilemma type scenario, especially the ones with lots of shares: If you cash out, sure the stock will plummet but you'll get out at the top. Meanwhile if everybody cashes out, the stock will crash and most people will be losers. But by keeping your faith in GME and the squeeze, you're all looking to be winners. Hell, on open today the stock soared up to nearly $500 a share, in spite of manipulation and freezing and that bullshit.
$BB is down to 16 right now, and falling. Buy the dip! I was promised 35EOM and i want it to fucking happen!
Title says it all.. $BB is down, a lot. Buy the fucking dip... You'll not get it for 16 again for a long damn time. Everyone seems to be panic selling, for some odd reason.

File report with the SEC
This is pure market manipulation by the brokerages. I've filed a report with the sec. So should you.
My 2 cents about the market and big corps trying to protect #GME, #AMC, #BB and #NOK
These old-timers may know how the market works and how to manipulate it, but they seem to not know how the internet works.  The effect of their moves to save their asses, with assistance from their friends (Robin Hood etc.) is two-fold:  1. It generates   MORE   hate towards them. This is more hate than current hate (and I just read someone's post stating he will "die with his  teeth  clenched to their  balls "). 2.   \- The   Streisand effect   is a social phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information has the unintended consequence of further publicizing that information, often via the Internet.  It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose attempt to suppress the California Coastal Records Project's photograph of her residence in Malibu, California, taken to document California coastal erosion, inadvertently drew further attention to it in 2003.  They are getting more attention by panicking and trying to block people.    IMO they are ending their own companies faster and faster by inciting more hate and publicity to this instead of covering their short positions (if they even  can , lol) or just admitting failure and going bankrupt.       They are going Full-Streisand.          (I am not an investment advisor and I have no idea how the market works. This is not investment advice.)     ((I do know a bit about the internet though.))
Everyone has to review Robinhood on the App Store and say they will block buying for certain stocks without notice.
Title says it all. Diamond hands
Come on guys we can take bb to the moon don‚Äôt let it fall

IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
UNITED STONKS OF AMERICA.
A Historical Perspective: Hold the Line
In Greek mythology, the son of Aries and Aphrodite was Phobos. This was the god of fear and panic.   Greeks believed that in combat, Phobos ‚Äì fear ruled the battlefield. Most of the Greek city states fielded almost identical armies. The tactics were similar, the armor was similar, it all was relatively even. Sheer willpower and discipline decided battles.   Victory could be yours, you just had to resist fear. Do not run as the spears get closer. This remains true to this day. Hold the line boys. The media and trading houses are trying to scare you. It is just a simple war cry. They know we are stronger than them, and we have them in a vice.   We must all hold. Call Phobos a bitch and spit in his face along with the Wall St bastards that try keep us down.  Hold the Line.
DO NOT SELL! THIS ONLY FUELS THE FIRE!
If you are selling now then you are not apart of the movement! This is about sticking it those rich fucks! They've only poked the bear by restricting trades! Once restrictions are lifted, and they will be, AMC and GME are going to shoot up to the moon! BUY BUY BUY
Apple App Store won‚Äôt let us rate/review Robinhood anymore, says I don‚Äôt own the app... Apple is the establishment, not surprised

NOBODY SELLS. DO YOU HATE MONEY?
FUCKING LISTEN UP AUTISTS. I saved for years and years. I never knew why the fuck I was living so frugally, didn't know what I was saving for. Well this was fucking it.  I DON'T KNOW WHICH OF YOU PAPER HANDED PUSSIES ARE SELLING. I nearly sold just now. Then I slapped myself and thought. You only fucking live once. I didn't make it this far to succumb at this point.  I don't care what you've bought. GME, BB. DON'T. FUCKING. SELL.  THIS WILL BE OUR BIGGEST WIN IN FUCKING CENTURIES.   NOBODY FUCKING SELLS.  THEY CAN'T BUY IF WE DON'T SELL.

We'll need to short RH's IPO
Looking ahead a bit with the full understanding that the SEC and and FINRA won't do anything for manipulating the market, we'll need to collectively short Robinhood after they IPO.  If it's okay for hedge funds to try to bankrupt a company they don't believe in, then it should be okay for the little guy to do the same thing.  If we point a rocket at the ground, it becomes a missile, and we can blow some shit up
Wow because I was upset about 212 and other platforms not letting the little man win? Although I‚Äôm new to trading so it‚Äôs only fair I learn  üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
So... "Short Robinhood"?
I AINT FOOOKN SELLING! BB
Plenty of people talking about Robing Hood. What about Interactive?
I am in Europe and my Rl1 (BB) Stock lost value of over 10K. How can I file a complaint as the  SEC doesn't operate here?
Why is no one holding
AMC and GME are plummeting. Why are we not holding the whole point was to hold and increase the price not sell when you see a little positive

Alternatives to Robinhood
With   million users, if we all pull our money out of RH, we can deal them a pretty devastating financial blow for screwing us like this. We need an alternative, though. Schwab is out, TD Ameritrade is out, what about WeBull? Anyone using Interactive Brokers or Fidelity? Any other platforms still allowing trading of $GME, $AMC, and $BB?

Whys BB dropped so low?
RATE THEM DOWN ON GOOGLE PLAY / APP STORE
Upvote so more people see it. Robinhood and the other brokers doing market manipulation to save their daddys hedge funds. Vote them fucking down on Google Play and App Store. Hurt them where it hurts.
holding, but concerned
Yello, welcome to this garbage day. I'm currently flush with $BB and $NKA shares that were of course doing well and seeming poised to continue doing so. -- it seems apparent that with sell being the only button available to us, we are expected to free up shares in a far reaching attempt to cover someone else's losses.  What's really suffering for me are the open contracts. Still well ITM, but trailing down of course. My anticipation in the event that this is resolved reasonably soon is that there's a knee jerk rebound of filled orders and quick buys. I'm already boarded and strapped in    for bumps, but wondering how my peers are doing this morning?
SPCE is squeezing    ü§£ü§£ü§£
What‚Äôs the price?
Webull says $297, fidelity says $397. Which fucking one is it?
Think of this like they‚Äôre all on sale, it‚Äôs a great time to buy!
Newbie who is here with you no matter what
I‚Äôm new to stocks. I‚Äôm a nurse. I‚Äôve been spending most of my time working COVID ICU lately. I browse reddit sometimes when there is downtime. There isn‚Äôt a lot of it. I‚Äôve seen this subreddit quite a bit. I guess I looked at it at the right time when GME was lower ($135) and bought some stocks. I have a measley 6 stocks. That‚Äôs a lot of money for me though. I‚Äôve looked much more into things since then as to why this is happening and what short stocking is. Just have to say although it‚Äôs so tempting to buy out right now, I still won‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm new to r/wallstreets but after doing some more intensive research I‚Äôm all for what is happening right now. I should probably add rocket emojis

Is the blocking of buying AMC stock going to seal the fate of movie theaters?
I really miss going to the movies, it was my favorite activity before the pandemic. I did invest what I could into AMC because I missed going to the theater. Now that we can no longer buy through the popular routes, is the movie theater experience doomed?
Is the rally over?
NOK's falling (-29%), BB has collapsed(-42%), and AMC is just obliterated (-64%). Did the shorts and the rest of the establishment win?
What's the best way to transfer my Robinhood account to an open democratized trading platform in a timely fashion?
Robinhood says they transfer accounts once a week. I feel by doing so today, I may miss out on the first half of next week. I'm somewhat concerned that they'll prevent selling at the peak too. I would appreciate any advice to help us Robinhood users!
HOLD THE FUCKING LINE BABY
They‚Äôre trying to put fear into you and it‚Äôs working HOLD THE LINE! Prices are dropping  because people are pulling out of Robin Hood to go somewhere else but that‚Äôs just a bump that will only prolong the inevitable. Once everyone is settled in again it‚Äôs all starts back up. SO HOLD YOU COWARDSSSS
This is the part where we point and laugh, right before class actioning them into the fucking ground.
Hold the fucking line you plebs buy more
Robinhood Might Crash the Market
Is it not lost on these brokers that much of the economic rally since March has been due to retail investors? If they start manipulating markets and enough of us get burnt we‚Äôll just be exiting in mass. Congrats Citadel, you saved a few billion at the expense of a few trillion.

Can we all sue robinhood?
Checked out why certain securities are not tradable on Robinhood and found this (and then fixed it for them).
PSA: Revolut has not blocked GME
With Robinhood and other predatory platforms actively blocking certain stocks, I think it's important to note that some are not doing the same. As of the time of writing, 4:45 CET, GME is still tradable through Revolut.

Don‚Äôt let Robinhood win this battle. Everyone move your assets to other brokers! You DO NOT need to sell to move accounts. Brokerage firms can move assets to a new firm at YOUR DEMAND! If robinhood wants to get in bed with WallStreetBets then WE WILL CANCEL THEM! REMEMBER ROBINHOOD NEEDS US, WE DONT NEED THEM!
MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC: It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not.
MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC:  It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).  Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.   They are blatantly manipulating the marketing

Remember this isn't a stop trade ordered by the exchange, they are still running fine.   this is a action to stop retail and save others.  credit goes to
Average Joe here. I'm not selling and I'm not backing down. I encourage you to do the same. Here's why:
A little background: I'm 29, and prior to Tuesday, the only thing I knew about stocks was to buy stable, dividend producing stocks. So, every month after my student loan payments, if I could find any extra money, I put a little into Medtronic and Apple to slowly save for retirement. I'd managed to save up roughly $2k in there over the last few years. I usually just lurk here for the memes because you're all hilarious.       I started getting into GME Tuesday morning because 1) you're all hilarious and I wanted to be part of it and 2) It was really interesting. I'm unfortunately no whale; I bought 2 shares at $91. My intent was to make some money and get out. Over the last 48 hours, my perspective has shifted drastically. I of course knew that the Wall Street billionaires were harmful, shady fucks, but the last 48 hours really opened my eyes to how harmful and shady they truly are. I started reading and learning about stock terminology and history, and about midway through yesterday, what's happening clicked for me. Sure, it's about money. But it's not about my money. It's about OUR money. Wall Street has been robbing everyone blind for years. That's not necessarily news, but it finally registered that even though I wasn't involved in the stock market, they were robbing me too. And I realized: this isn't a money grab. It's a movement. For the first time ever, the little guy has the bully by the neck. And the bully is scared shitless. So I sold all of my other stock, put the rest of my liquid money into my account, and bought a   more shares. It ain't much, but it's honest work.        Last night, after all of my reading, I finally understand (a little, anyway) the position that they have, the position that we have, and the ramifications. And what it boils down to is that they can't do anything to us legally. All we have to do is hold. We don't even have to buy more. Those shorts will be due at some point, and when that happens, not only do those Wall Street fucks have to buy all of our shares, but they have to buy them all   times. Dumbasses. Don't let anyone tell you this is your fault or that you're doing something wrong. They borrowed more stock than even exists, sold it, and now that it's becoming time to return it, are freaking the hell out. Again, dumbasses.  Since they can't do anything legally, they've turned to shady shit. Companies blocking purchases of the stock, artificially (and illegally) driving prices down. Raiding the subreddit with bots and shills. Employing scare tactics in the media. They're pulling out all of the stops. And for me, that's IT. I'm done with these fuckers.     What this has turned into is a straight up financial revolution, and I, for one, am here for it. I've been so frustrated feeling powerless politically, socially, and financially lately, and now there's an opportunity to rise up. I'm invigorated. I haven't been this motivated in a very long time, probably ever. I may only have   shares, but you can bet your wife that I would buy more if I were able to. If I make money, cool. But at this point, I don't care if I lose every penny. I've been broke my entire life and I can do it again. I'll reach down, grab my bootstraps, and pull myself up again. But not before I rip ass right in those billionaire's faces. I don't care what happens to my money, these billionaires will burn. You can pry my   shares from my cold dead hands.        To you guys: I love you, ride or die.     To Wall Street: You done fucked around, and you're about to find out. Come get me.       And to the SEC: go fuck yourself. I like this stock.
They are scared, they are trying so hard to scare people into selling
From forcing apps to only allow selling, to halting the market on any down spike. This just reinforces that buying and holding is the right call. You can see how desperate they are for people to panic sell.

Robinhood reported to the SEC.
Not sure if anyone has already done this but I just reported Robinhoods actions to the SEC and called to have it intestate immediately. Also emailed Robinhood to urge them to stop this manipulation, though its clearly already to late for them... I dont think Robinhood will survive this.  Please, if you can, everyone do the same and pursue any other avenue possible to stop this and get it remedied.   But most importantly, HOLD!

The classic story of robinhood, screwing the little guy to protect the rich.
Can they even comprehend how hypocritical this is? I'm don't with robinhood forever.   Will I still be able to take part in the class action after closing my account?
Note - Cashapp allows trading GME. EVERYONE HAS CASHAPP.
Others take some time to approve you but if you already have Cashapp you can just buy in there. If this gets enough traction then I think we see another huge retail buying wave.

Hold for the Future of Our Children
Look guys I understand those who want to cash out for profits. I had my account blown multiple times and I had to live off bread crumbs.  But do u know who wont have to scramble for scraps ro survive? The big institutions. They will be bailed out by tax payer's money because they are "too big to fail".  This is the time it is different, it will be "too expensive to save". We have to stand together and change the future. Do u wan ur tax money given to greedy pigs on wall streets or do u wan ur tax money used to build more schools and hospitals?  This single event will be able to change the future regulations and how hedge funds function.   TLDR: Hold for a better future!!

Some of y'all may not remember but this is not the first time that RH has stepped on their own dick. There is an EXISTING CLASS ACTION against RH in a federal court in Florida for RH's failures last March.  These new issues may be rolled into the existing suit, which is being handled by Shumaker Lawfirm. (Or it may become a separate suit, but Shumaker will likely be leading the charge on that as well.) They are currently collecting claims! Email a description of what has happened to you with your RH account to:     I don't work for Shumaker or benefit in any way by sharing this.

Read: Do not let Robinhood and others fuck you over like they did to me. Good luck, boys
Boys,  This is war.   Robinhood, TD, Schwab and others are coming to the aid of their friends and Melvin and Citadel. If you don‚Äôt think they have access to your order flow, you‚Äôre out of your mind. They know exactly how to force us out if we‚Äôre not smart about this.   This morning when RH blocked buys it forced the price down, below my stops (which I know we retards don‚Äôt typically have) and forced me out of my positions. This was a calculated play by BIG HEDGE FUCKS to move us out of the market.   Do not make the same mistake I did. Remove any Stop/Losses you have and ride the bumpy pre-market that these assholes are creating. WE LIKE THIS STOCK!  Hold the line. I‚Äôll be watching from the sidelines. Good luck brothers.

Thankful to my fellow retards and autists for bringing Silver back to light but this is something I've been tracking for quite some time.  In April 2011 Silver hit an all time high of \~$50.  I believe on its 10 year anniversary of hitting ATH we will see $50 again on April 2021.  But with the help of our WSB army we can get there way sooner and instead of $50 we can be celebrating SLV at $100.    You all know about the gold:silver ratio and how it's ridiculously behind when compared to historic times.  LETS DO THISSSS  positions: SLV calls up the gazoo $SLV $AGQ $AG $AllWhoMinesSilver
What the actual fuck is happening to BB today?
My balls are bleeding out as we speak. Cut by these diamond hands. But for real I don‚Äôt understand
BUY THE GME DIP NOW!!!!
AMC Pending on Cashapp?
It‚Äôs 1 hr past 9:30 but I can‚Äôt cancel and it‚Äôs not going through. Is AMC being blocked?
What they give us.... what they won't
Oh really? They won't let us buy more stocks.... in a stock market just because they would lose some money? Oh really? They lock us out of our portfolios - OURS - because they would lose some money? Oh really? They will lie and manipulate through so many major media outlets because they are losing some money? How many times does the mask have to be ripped off? The only difference this time is that they are not distracting us with something else... They aren't even trying to use identity politics to cover their tracks this time. (I mean, this whole.... thing, has been said to of done more good than Occupy Wallstreet (which happened in 2011) - and look where that lead us:    Processing img gixzk98ef3e61...               And I'm not sure if any of you are old enough, but back when Obama signed in gay marriage, he at the exact same time he was bringing in a law that drastically increased wealth disparity by changing the laws to massively benefit the rich - and on reddit the overall feeling was with each new "feel good" law, what are they distracting us from now?  So realize it or not, this is more than tendies, this is more than fun profits, we are attacking the very core of what the 1% hold dear. I can only imagine what they will throw at us next, or what ideas they will   up to protect themselves. But from this moment, do not be surprised if it is not only legislation and rhetoric that is again retail investors - they will try and memory-hole this HARD.  So HOLD HOLD HOLD. I had a dream and the magic price is $5300. Or not. I can't give any advice, political or financial. I'm clearly stupid. But I do love the stock.
Robinhood et all
What can we do. Class action lawsuits?  App reviews?  What else
Whats happening to $BB??
Just as the title says, what the hell is happening with $BB?
This doesn‚Äôt look right  ! Someone‚Äôs hiding some ratings.
WHO MAKES JET PACKS
I'd back them, whoever they are
WRITE TO YOUR HOUSE REPRESENTATIVE AND URGE THEM TO HAVE A HEARING ON THE ABUSIVE MARKET MANIPILATION BY ROBINHOOD
This conduct cannot be accepted by any regulating institutions. Robinhood is engaging in a severe form of market manipulation and probably fraud.   Write a letter to your legislator or to the chariwoman of the congressional financial services cmte Rep. Maxine Waters ( .  You can also write to the Senate Cmte on Finance  .  Justice has to be served!
Is AMC fucked or do I double down?
AMC has crashed hard and I just learned I can't buy fractional shares of GME so I wanna put it somewhere. But is AMC gonna ride again?
I don‚Äôt know much about stocks but I‚Äôm willing to drop $500-$1000 on AMC or GME right now. Which one should I do and is it likely that the stocks won‚Äôt keep dropping?
Merrill is also preventing people from buying
I haven‚Äôt tried to buy anything today, but my mom just told me about it. Figured I‚Äôd update here. Sorry if someone already posted this, but I didn‚Äôt feel like sorting through   members‚Äô worth of posts to find previous people posting this.
Is GME gonna dip frequently?
My deposits likely won't be in my account until Monday, is it ever gonna briefly dip to something like 400-500 by then?
Cant buy?
Did they halt trading on GME?
NOK is the dumbest scam, never had a reason to fly which is why it's failing. It's like saying you wanted TSLA but bought NKLA instead. Buy shit, get shit.

Just opened new account on Fidelity. F  k Robinhood. Game still on!
What trading platform now?!?!?!
So I want to start  trading. And  I may be a little late to the GME game but I got some liquid to spill into it. Also I get the feeling that GME is just a start for this sub and  I want  to be primed to help do the lords work as it were. so does anyone have a platform suggestion now that Robinhood has become part of the bourgeoise?
Quick Announcement! I've been using eTrade!
My employer gives me shares of our company through eTrade, and I haven't had any issues buying or selling anything today or yesterday. It isn't as user friendly as Garbagehood, but it seems to be working just fine at the moment. Send her home boys, lets ride these rockets to the moon!
Hedge-funds trying to scare us, don‚Äôt fall for it, that‚Äôs what they want, don‚Äôt give them what they want
Hold hold god dammit
Don't punish yourself for taking a stand, punish those responsible for holding you back!!
After what happened this morning and the pure market manipulation that happened, I wont have much money to even make it through the month. I know I am not the only one who's in this exact predicament.  Don't punish yourself or hate yourself for taking a stand, you tried and they cut off your legs. Right now we need to stay together and punish these pricks for what they've done, not ourselves or each other.   We've made history, and you were apart of it, but this is just the beginning so stand tall and stand together our fights not over just yet.
Battle with $AMC
I had a limit order to buy 100 AMC @ $12.  It finally came in, but did so in 4 chunks. given that there is 182M daily volume, this leads me to infer there are some MASSIVE hands that are in this game.   Reiterating my confidence in AMC.  Hold the line boys.
Family man hoping to jump in on all of the justice you all are doing. What's the best place to invest some small cash to help the disrupt and help my infant daughter get a better life? Any good stock recommendations?
Can't trade at all on eToro and Stake right now
Stake still has not processed my $10k deposit and eToro deposits aren't even working, and when the menu does work it crashes shortly after.  They're all claiming technical difficulties on their Twitter accounts and shit but there's screenshots of people on Stake  only getting emails that their GME/AMC trades were rejected     Fuck my life

I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON SO I BOUGHT A COUPLE STOCK!
AMCA cause AMC was blocked on Robin Hood, so what the hell right?  2 shares in MZDAY cause they were like 3$ and a share in SPCE.
Remember that the shorts haven‚Äôt covered!!
Being closed out of AMC and GME on robinhood feels hella illegal
HOLD GME APES TOGETHER STRONG
Merrill Lynch is also shutting down trading on GME and AMC to manipulate the market.
I just found this...
Found this sub and gotta say, good job. Do it again, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs the limits of what you can do. Even if they make it illegal if enough people do it they can stop you all.
Thanks for keeping me safe Robinhood!
I¬¥m allowed to buy AMC, should i do it?
Already lost alot but im holding the stocks that i already have in AMC but should i buy more at the price it is now?
THE ROBINHOOD BS MEANS WERE ALMOST THERE
They are getting nervous and doing all they can to stop us from heading to Mars. BUT WE GOT THIS. It hit four hundred fucking seventy at one point they are scared. This is insane boys we‚Äôve got this.

RH margin maintenance sudden increase?
Anyone else‚Äôs margin maintenance increase over night? I didn‚Äôt buy any stocks and the stock I do hold all went up. Not sure why my maintenance would go up 50% overnight. This put me in a margin deficit, so I can‚Äôt buy now...
went all in, dont let these flop just for GME
Which brokers are still working?
I was able to buy from TD Ameritrade, but I think it's crashed.
FCEL = NEW
Cant trade GME? What can they do, ban every stonk?
Fuck Robinhood, this team has the right idea $DEUS
Not Much but It's all I got. I'm Holding GME TO THE MOON
Market manipulation
On top of Broker moves we all know about we are seeing massive bear volume in every stock talked about here. Feels like a coordinated sell off. I will hold all my positions and will believe in the divine justice of the invisible hand. If I'm right the motive is to crush our sentiment on GME so the only way to prevail is for individuals to hold GME without any reserve. Other battles can be won later.  Hold the line, I am not an advisor or giving advice do your own DD.
STOP FUCKING SAYING "ITS THE END" HOOOOOOOOOOOLDD!!!!!
FUCKING HOLD
You can buy blocked stocks with the cash app + others.
We have to let everyone know the alternatives that still let you buy GME and AMC. Like cash app. List some other ones people can use.

$AMC getting halted on Robinhood and WeBull. BUY ON PUBLIC AND SEND GME and AMC to the Moon
Watching $AMC & $NOK tank while $GME soars makes me happy they locked me out of every buying option. Now I‚Äôll bide my time and pounce on $AMC with everyone else after $GME is maxed out. Diamond Hands my brothers and sisters!
just bought 3k in GME and $700 in AMC from Australia.    for friends in the US getting bummed by Robinhood

BB down. are you all holding?
cmon all you have to do is hold and we all profit .... hold that shit diamond hands up
$GME Do you really think theyll allow DFV to keep his money?
As a student of history I can tell you that that the powers that be like making examples out of undeserving people.  Remember that british autistic guy who beat all the hedge funds from his moms basement? They found him and they fined him and they took his money away from him.  Theyre gonna hit our boy with some manipulation charges or some bullshit.

LOW SUPPLY + HIGH DEMAND = EVEN HIGHER PRICES.  They‚Äôre trying to protect the evil wall street firms, but they‚Äôre actually killing them even more. Idiots.

Downvote and leave bad reviews for Robinhood on all possible platforms!
Turn their app ratings against them and put them in the ground! This is not the first time Robinhood has restricted trades but let‚Äôs make it the fucking last by absolutely obliterating their credibility and ratings. Fuck Robinhood!
Let's all File SEC Complaint against RobinHood NOW!!!

Is Webull App Not To Be trusted Now Too? Unable to Open Account.
I made an account with late last night with Robinhood and we all know what Robinhood is pulling  this morning.   So I decided to and  open an account with the Webull Android App but when I click the 'Open Account' button nothing happens.  Is Webull busted same as Robinhood?
HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!
Buy more DO NOT SELL!!!! HOLD THE LINE
DO NOT SELL YOUR RH POSITIONS. Transfer them out to a legitimate platform.
Open an account with a real platform - Fidelity, TDA, Schwab - whatever the fuck you want.    All these platforms allow you to transfer your portfolio in from RH.    Do that TODAY.    After it is transfered, never ever fucking use Robinhood again. Ever.
Don't fail me now guys
FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS. HOLD THE LINE!!!
New people will blame /wsb/ for this.
And the establishment will pile on causing there to be legislature preventing social media investing. In order to "protect the retail investors".  But we'll all know it's to protect the opposite.
HOLD AMC AND BUY MORE
ULTIMATE DIP IS HERE EAT IT UP, WHEN ROBINHOOD GETS THEIR ASS STRETCHED EVERYTHING WILL GO BACK UP
Not selling!
How Wall Street Mafia works
The stock is at   and someone is literally selling 205 shares for 1$. Amazing. Crooks. They need to burn.
Both AMC and GME falling. With no one being able to Buy this is expected, dont be scared.
With a large majority of us no being able to buy, this is to be expected, dont worry, dont be scared. They want you to sell now flooding the market with sell orders before the squeeze, the time to have DFV Hands is now, hopefully we can Buy soon.  If u/DeepFuckingValue is still in after todays market manipulation, so should you.   \  This is not financial advise
Platforms that have not banned GME, AMC etc.
With all the news of Robinhood and IBKR etc. restricting trades. Wanted to have a thread that lists what platforms have not banned so people may flock if they wish.   I have IBKR and I just tried to buy GME, 1 share with no margin and still wouldn‚Äôt let me do it, so their Tweet about letting you buy GME stock long with no margin is a lie.
STOP SELLING GME. STAY STRONG KINGS
Call your senators and congressman. Be calm, don‚Äôt act crazy and explain the situation. Then voice your support for giving all Americans access To a free market.
You can call an email.

Please take your time to do this. It‚Äôs blatant volume manipulation, make it known.  And if portnoy, Cuban, or Chamath are listening please start throwing some layers at this and open a go fund me, wsb will have your back.   This wedding is horseshit.

Is gme blocked on saxo currently?
I don't care if $BB goes to 0 I'm not selling. It's about making a point and proof of Robinhood's manipulation

STICK TO THE PLAN   AMC & GME   MOON HERE WE COME
Robinhood took halted AAL too.
AAL (American Airlines) was up 25% at open because they‚Äôre earnings report was a smaller loss than projected. Robinhood almost immediately stopped people from buying AAL as well to prevent a short squeeze. Fuckers.
I bought AMC and NOK yesterday, and I am holding. There‚Äôs no reason to sell is there?
They can‚Äôt keep us from buying forever. And now there is a chance to buy these even cheaper than I did.  Why sell when it can all keep getting bought? What other point is there
Ok guys, when do we strike back
How a about a coordinated 2 hrs of keeping our hands still, making them think we left the game, and then pushing back all together?
Leave Robinhood
What is so great about them anyway? They changed the industry but now free trades are everywhere.   You also can‚Äôt define a beneficiary which is a huge pain in the ass if you ever need to transfer your wealth.   Fuck them by leaving them and opening a new brokerage account.
MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU'LL READ ALL DAY- PLEASE CHECK!

GME is frozen at $  and not moving at all
BROTHERS, HOLD ON TO ALL YOUR STOCKS
WE CAN TAKE GMETO 1K
Although some brokers blocked GME, you can buy them on Etoro right now!
If you wish to buy GME, get yourself on Etoro and buy some now.  It's currently dipping 15% under as of 10:39am EST, so you can buy more!  It's dipping because certain broker platforms are blocking from buying but letting you sell, this is causing silly people to sell prematurely.  You can ride this out until the shorts start closing, then you will get MASSIVE GAINS
Hey guys how long should we hold onto GME for.
How long do yall predict this is  going to last?
HELP YOUR BROTHERS ON AMC!!!
Amc is taking a beating! Help them dont sell. They are putting in massive asks vs bids. 300k vs   are trying to shut us down.  DO NOT SELL!!!!! HOLD THE LINE!  BUY AMC, I LIKE AMC STOCK!
TD Ameritrade blocked GME last night - Robinhood blocked GME today. Do you think there will (or should) be a backlash to retail brokers blocking access to trading the companies mentioned on WSB?
I think that when you sign up for a brokerage account you're taking responsibility for your actions with your money. There should be a severe penalty imposed on companies like TD Ameritrade and Robinhood for blocking accounts in good standing from buying/selling stocks.   It is more apparent than ever that there is   collusion with retail brokers, traditional financial news outlets, and institutional investors.   Does this prove that there is an 'institutional collusion' between them - agree / disagree?

Not only should a class action lawsuit against RH come into fruition, but tanking their ratings on the App Store develops the disapproval of advertisements on iOS by Apple
‚ú®Now, I might be retarded, but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. ‚ú®  RH has been a ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù app on the iOS App Store practically since the app was released. It also holds the #1 rank in finance, something they don‚Äôt believe we (the autists holding the market by the balls) deserve, apparently.   You don‚Äôt even have to write a review, but written reviews leave more of an impact to those seeing the app for the first time. When an app falls below   stars on the App Store, it is removed from the ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù section - something RH‚Äôs developers hold dearly because that means free advertisement + the ability to hold #1 in finance. Nobody wants to promote an app with less than   stars. If they don‚Äôt wanna promote the people, why help them get promoted.  They may not have taken  all  of the tendies, but they sure are keeping us from the #  SAUCE  .   Who the fuck wants to enjoy their tendies on Mars, a desolate, desert planet without any god damn   sauce  ?

Fuck Robinhood
FUCK THEM. GME trading suspended by major brokerages. But you know what? Won't matter. When it resumes, WE . WILL. ALL. BUY. AND. HOLD.

Don't let all these suspensions and market manipulation get you worried. $GME/$AMC/$NOK are allll only going up once the manipulators get FUCKED.
How to perpetuate this GME disruption
Alright all, here me out. This is my one chance to let my stupidity shine for all to see.  I'm a software developer. I've been on the fence about entrepeneurship but I have had some ideas bounce around my head. This one has been validated by DFV and the GME squeeze.  We need a trading app that lets you   automatically follow someone else's trades  . Think robo-investing, except it's not an algorithm deciding your next moves, it's u/DFV. You pay X subscription to follow Y person, and whenever they invest in stonk A, you match with whatever % of your portfolio you've dedicated to following this person (times whatever % of their portfolio is in this trade).     Everybody knows that the GME squeeze has been as magnificent as it has because of DFV's diamond hands, balls, toenails, etc. Everybody's holding till he's holding. Well what if that was actually, programatically true? Let the diamond handed captain steer your ship.     r/wsb has anti-self promotion rules, which is fine, but if there's enough interest and other devs who want to start working on this, I think now's the time to do it. Show robinhood that nobody's married to them. So I just thought I'd post my stupid idea for the world to see \[then watch some other group steal it and run with it and get rich\]. Because more than anything, I just want to see the thing built. It's okay if I'm not the one profiting from me.     WE LIKE THE STOCK

How will BB bounce back if no one can buy it?!
Trying to justify holding the line
With NOK blocked thoughts on ERIC
BB Buy?
Is now the time to buy BB? Should we do the same as we did with gme? I can dump a couple hundred into it if this is our next route.
I bought 1000 shares of AMC at $  a piece. How fucked am I?
I‚Äôm down like 3 grand and I‚Äôm getting nervous. 64% drop seems like a little more than a dip.
[PSA] Wells Fargo only brokerage still executing GME
IBKR, Robinhood, and Merill all toast for me. They wont even let you transfer cash from a checking account at schwab to brokerage! online transfer is down‚Ä¶.  Wells is the only one holding and it's a freaking IRA for me
STILL BUYING
CashApp is still allowing AMC and NOK purchases for sure,  I just bought some of both !!

Alternative Options Trader in Europe - SaxoTrader
For anyone who like me has been experiencing issues with Interactive Broker and the like, the Saxo Bank trader - SaxoTrader Go has become my go to. I have been struggling to use the IB platform over the past several days, with incorrect flagging issues, intermittent crashes and all sorts. Saxo so far has a very clean ( although abit old fashioned) UI, fast customer support, good fees and so far transparency on the instruments themselves. I would heavily recommend now that several exchanges have stepped out to try and interrupt our crusade. Anyone else have good alternatives?

Citadel hedge fund owns Melvin Capital. Citadel is an investor in Robinhood. Market Manipulation.

Anyone seeing the dips?
Just curious about the thoughts on this current dip with NAKD.
Thoughts if I/we try to make a brokerage.
I don‚Äôt hold GME positions but holy shit I‚Äôm pissed.   What they didn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt right, if we made our own brokerage, would anyone actually use it ? I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs possible, but I can start researching.
Alternative to Robin hood and the like?
Since I can't use the app I have what do you recommend?
Based on yesterday‚Äôs close GME is not stationary on a monthly time frame
Please WSB, do a massive announcement if there is a class action lawsuit so that we can be informed on how to get involved! My order, as well as many others has been unfairly canceled without our consent! We are losing money on our rightful investments!
What‚Äôs happening to AMC?!

Everyone CALM down and just HOLD, we have almost WON this war
GUYS LISTEN UP!  The hedge funds are shitting them selves and this is their last move. Yesterday they spread fake news about covering, today they are trying to stop us from buying more shares. This only means that we are really close to the end. Tomorrow when the weekly and monthly calls expire they are FUCKED.   NO MATHER WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT SELL! Just take a look at twitter, we have a lot of big names on our side. Even TRUMPJ JR and AOC are on the same side, OURS!   The attention we are getting keeps growing BELIEVE me you don't want to miss the squeeze. We are going to freaking andromeda!   Just don't sell.

With Great Power Comes Great responsibility
As an outsider to this group perhaps the possibilities of using your new found power for good is worth discussion? This could be a new tool to bring the particularly unethical market actors to account. Individuals and entities which regulators have either through neglect, inability or outright graft have allowed to flourish and literally get away with murder. Actors who buy our politicians and media only to benefit their very narrow economic interests. On the flip side it could be used to reward those who's actions are particularly selfless and benefit the broader society. Of course then the question is who would judge and do due diligence to ensure the selected entities are in fact either guilty or worthy is a delicate question.
Hedge funds end game
So it looks like the hedge funds are rallying their allies.   As we all know, these people systematically target certain companies with huge short positions.  They do it repeatedly and with impunity.  They never have to answer for their naked shorts (hope you're reading SEC) or their misinformation  .    In the case of GME they shorted to around 140% of the float.  And kept doing it.  Somebody noticed and called them on it by taking long positions.  The hedges responded by doubling down because they are arrogant geniuses.  It didn't work.  Price kept going up.  The called their PR people and ran (are running) a disinformation   painting themselves as some sort of victims.  Didn't work.  Now they are using all of their resources to stop the ability of retail investors to trade stocks because we're too "unsophisticated".    Here's the thing:  this behavior on the part of hedge funds and the rest of Wall Street will never end unless they face the consequences of their misguided actions.  If the likes of Melvin Capital and Citron go out of business, if their clients lose their money, maybe then, and only then, will this manipulation and corruption be contained.

If we sell they win. Buy $AMC!

General strike and Occupy Wall Street 2 - Electric Boogaloo
There's only one way we the people come out of this on top. We take the fight to them. We get a huge occupy wall street movement going again, both physically and digitally.   Secondly, we get a huge general strike going. We need to make demands.   My demands are UBI, Single payer healthcare, student loan debt elimination, medical debt elimination, jail all the bankers.   What else should we include?

Activision-Blizzard (ATI) could be a useful stock to buy.
SO guys, I recommend grabbing some of their stock. I know that it's not a huge gain like you guys are used to, but let's be honest; World of Warcraft: Shadowlands was the fastest-selling game of all time until Cyberpunk came out.     Blizzcon is in 2 weeks or so, and with it the announcement of Patch   If this does get dropped and the hype explodes, you could be seeing some very large gains in the stock, just like when Shadowlands was announced and dropped.

The battle lines are drawn. We have reached the climax of the battle. THE SQUEEZE STARTS NOW!
To be completely honest, I did not consider this scenario. At worst case I thought the SEC or someone would step in and halt trading temporarily, or possibly there would be new stock issued to dilute the pool. But this, this is something else. AFAIK, all the brokers now have halted trades on purchase of GME securities. Even Merill locked me out. They didn't star the lock until around 10:15am EST - 10:45am EST  The battle lines are drawn now bros. We have reached peek levels. The    have their backs to the wall.

I have 1 month left on my call contracts for BB should I sell? this loss is scary I'm starting to lose everything I've made.
I figured out how they're going to rig this!
They're going to halt buying GME for a month so that they can bleed the smaller buyers that put everything they had in. The squeeze (arguably, or at least the gamma squeeze) should happen tomorrow Friday January 29th and many people especially with small shares might have gained bigly and sold. They're going to force some people to decide whether to sell or eat.   This is my theory and I am not a financial advisor or expert but I can see the happening.

Hear me out: Why not build our own trading platform?
Hypothetically speaking, if we are upset with what Robinhood and others are doing, why not come together and build our own platform? I know it‚Äôs not easy, but over some time we could develop a trading platform that is truly for the common man. No manipulation, halting trades, or any other bullshit. Just free trading.  I would surely dump $ toward such a project. Thoughts?

I haven't invested anything before but his whole thing intrigued me. Should I invest in BB? Planning on around 200$ (a lot for me because im pretty young)
Everyday we're hustlin'
Best punishment aside from class action suit should be switching to another platform in droves. Fuck Robinhood!
I‚Äôm switching today to Fidelity. Even better... amongst us   users there should be very talented programmers/coders to start a new platform. It is now the time to do that because there is a momentum for it.
Legal action won't do shit, you think the sec is on our side? What we need is to start taking some power ourselves, we need to start our own hedge funds and brokerages, we're fighting a war, and it's time to arm ourselves like our enemies!!!!

How I‚Äôm dealing with Robinhood‚Äôs market manipulation and anti free market behavior.
First, a few thoughts on Robinhood‚Äôs actions. I believe this is directly instructed by hedge funds with short interest. I‚Äôm guessing that RH has been in negotiations with a few of these HFs to discuss IPOs and someone gave them a call yesterday and crying about how they‚Äôre breaking the market. RH is worried about their success in the future. They decided to make a calculated guess that the damage done by pissing off Wall Street would be worse than pissing off their customers. It would be grand if they were wrong  I am going to exit all my RH positions on Friday, transfer all my cash to Fidelity and buy back in next week. They lost this customer permanently... I‚Äôd rather deal with a clunky mobile UI than plain anti consumer manipulation.
WHY IS EVERYONE BUYING AMC, KEEP BUYING GME WHILE ITS DIPPING

Robinhood may have banned selling and buying, but the online brokers havent!
Just plunked thousands into NAKD and NOK online
Turn it off!!
Don‚Äôt look at the price. Don‚Äôt stress. Hold!!
Complaints to Robinhood, the SEC, and FINRA aren't enough. Contact your Congressman directly and complain
Retweet and bring attention to people on our side.
Retweet and tweet people on our side about this.
People who just bought AMC at the lowest point will literally double their money today. I‚Äôm an idiot for worrying.
BE AWARE! The back end on a lot of these alternative trading apps are not secure!
Your info will likely be compromised in some way. Probably just phone numbers and emails. With that
GameStonks: or how Reddit learned to speculate despite the fundamentals
The reddit group r / wallstreetbets recently coordinated a massive purchase of GameStop shares (for various reasons, the attachment of the gaming community or the similarity with the meme stonks). There are those who have gained from the increase in the value of the shares and those who have bought options to buy GameStop shares at values ‚Äã‚Äãprior to the bubble, or those who have shorted these securities, lending them at a low price and binding the investor to buy them back at market price in the future. Several low-level traders on Reddit have therefore led to the loss of several Hedge Funds traders. In summary, the r / wallstreetbets group is made up of individuals who want to earn, some users also seek ideological revenge, comparing this situation to the 2008 crisis, which are clearly different given the government causes and all the dynamics of the fundamentals that occurred in that period . Indeed, the 2008 crisis was not orchestrated by a single hedge fund, but the combination of low interest rates, real estate incentives and financial innovations not controlled and used by the same state agencies as the two FMs are a completely different case. In any case, users are trying to push up the values ‚Äã‚Äãof certain actions, in order to make money. Certainly hedge funds will have to hire workers who control these unconventional but legitimate groups of investors. However, it is clear that the income of the redditors comes exclusively from the options they have stipulated with hedge funds and from the first sales. The value of the shares that grows in itself does not take money away from any solid institution, in fact the shares are inflated by the same individuals who want to earn by selling, it is only to understand who can sell before the value goes down and who will have to pay for others , but it is a new battle between the poor (or at least between ordinary individuals). However, it will be possible in the future to organize for new options, given that the inflated shares will not reflect dividends on that value (GameStop does not grant dividends worth a single share of 400 euros), and certainly conventional financial institutions will have to try to keep under control or ally with unconventional ones. But there is nothing revolutionary, the markets are made up of different competing institutions, the 2008 crisis is obviously different (look for Vernon Smith and all the other economists who have talked about it, and the losses of the hedge funds themselves). of course the gain initially took place, but now it is only redditors who inflate each other's shares and transfer losses from fluctuations, hedge funds will be careful not to take options during this period, they will not promise to buy at a future market price (hedge funds fund therefore will not shock) and will not allow you to buy an option on a share they own and then risk reselling the share at a low price compared to the market. The frenzy is already over, the gains from Wall Street have already been taken, the rationality of the market will bring the shares back to their initial value, because companies cannot guarantee dividends for that value. The loss began, but some fast traders were still able to make money. The individual gains more importance, hedge funds will always have to deal with it. I see a good decentralization effect and widespread nihilism, but interest rate policies and bailouts have nothing to do with this event, it's just a market distortion that has turned out to be more positive for the poorer counterpart, but which will now charge. the price to the less informed newcomers. For the situation of the bailouts, rules on the stability of banks are necessary, which is the responsibility of individual managers. In short, a one-off loss does not resolve the situation, nor indiscriminate taxation towards such different institutions, as proposed by the AOC which sees only a large casino in the markets, and not also the institution that in 2020 clearly communicated the need to overcome the 'use of oil, not because there is a single moral being behind it, but because financial institutions are the necessary tool to create a price system and provide credit to possible productive companies.  The SEC will still monitor the situation, but if it does not find any major player who has put in place a Pump and Dump strategy,   the coordination and spreading of rumors to buy a stock, to raise the price beyond the fundamental, and resell it later, SEC will not be able to do anything to hit the group, made up exclusively of individuals who participate in a ponzi scheme but without any central director, only more or less clever players. Robinhood prevented the purchase of GameStop shares, probably to decrease the value and reduce losses of hedge funds, but being a free market there are companies like Webull or Sofi that still allow you to buy shares, the ponzi scheme therefore continues.
Trying to help you guys out but no apps letting me buy!!!

Where can I still buy the stock we like? Both my resources are shut down on it right now. Any advice?
Im scared, GME is now below $300 and the brokers are f'ing us
Are we actually going to recover from this? Or will my entire investment in GME be for nothing?
Open new accounts and buy more GME BB AMC
The line is flailing
So now Robinhood and Webull??? also suspended AMC??? MARKET MANIPULATION AT ITS FINEST.

Is it possible that Robinhood and other Exchanges are halting buy on GME and only allowing SELL is because there are no more shares to buy? No Liquidity due to the 140% short?

DO NOT SELL. If you haven‚Äôt bought in yet you‚Äôre probably too late but we can still support the greater cause.
Fidelity is allowing instantly traceable deposits up to 10k. Make the switch
You can switch to fidelity and instantly buy gme up to 10k. I personally won‚Äôt use robinhood any more after this BS so I need to switch anyway.   May as well be right now.
It‚Äôs only a loss if you sell
This sounds like a joke, but if nobody sells and we keep buying where we can, we can beat this. Don‚Äôt panic sell, it‚Äôs just a dip.  Not financial advice
IM NOT SELLING
Where can I open a brokerage account today ASAP and invest in a fractional share of GME today ASAP?
I previously used Robinhood to buy shares but obviously that's not an option (they cancelled my trades this morning) and then I signed up for Fidelity which just stopped allowing fractional trades of Gamestop. So before I sign up for another company that won't allow me to buy a fractional share of GME, can anyone tell me a company that works for buying it?
I put everything I had in GME to help this cause.
Please tell me we haven‚Äôt given up.

Robinhood raped and murdered a young girl in 1990
Now I know what you are saying. That is ridiculous. An online brokerage with no corporeal form, founded in 2013, could have never committed such a heinous crime three decades ago.  But has Robinhood ever denied it? Had Robinhood ever come out and said "We didn't rape or kill that young girl 30 years ago"?  Until Robinhood issues a denial (or an apology for that sick act), we should have serious doubts about whether we can trust Robinhood.
IF YOU SOLD, DO NOT FORGET
IF YOU SOLD DO NOT FORGET TO BUY BACK WHEN ITS POSSIBLE!!!  FOR THOSE OF YOU HOLDING! STAY STRONG!!!!
STOP FUCKING SELLING YOUR GME STOCKS!!
Everyone needs to stop panicking and selling their shit. You‚Äôre letting these pricks win people! The short sellers are now laughing and making their cash all back! Fucking hold and buy more now that we have this dip!! STOP SELLING!

"Robinhood blocks new purchases of GameStop stock"
Question about robinhood
Say that some group of rightfully pissed-off traders decided to all take their money out of robinhood on the same day after letting their funds sit there (obviously it would be a bad idea at the moment because they need to hold GME). Would this cause financial damage to the company?  This is NOT financial advice or advice in any way, simply a question
I‚Äôm getting nervous about BB - please send some reassuring messages!
I really want to hold it! Put ¬£500 in BB yesterday and I need some reassurance to hold since it‚Äôs currently tanking!

This is what the gay bears want. We aren‚Äôt able to buy, so they start shorting and creating an incredible excess of supply, dropping the price to lower levels.

Remember That Uncle Sam Is Riding the Tendie Train, Too
I know that some of us are making their first real gains here (RIP Loss Porn), but don't forget that short term capital gains - which these will be taxed at - get taxed as income. If GME is going to become a life changing amount of money for you, you owe it to yourself look at the tax brackets that you will be moving to as a result so that you can prepare for a much bigger tax bill this year:    I guess this is coming off as financial advice but it isn't, I like the stock,      SEE YOU AT THE MOON

People seem to be underestimating how much of this isn‚Äôt fueled by just making money, but by hatred for Wall Street itself
People seem to think this is purely a group effort to try and make a quick buck, but if they came here for just a few minutes, they could see just how much of this is being fueled by hatred for Wall Street. I mean sure, if we can stick it to Wall Street while making money ourselves, why not? we‚Äôre not  that  retarded. From what I‚Äôve seen in the comments here I‚Äôd have to say it‚Äôs 50/50 on making money/trying to fuck Wall Street for once, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I was underestimating the hate.  Also, HOLD YOU STUPID FUCKING APES
RIP GME
Let's take a stand and make money together, retards
I am beyond upset and it's within reason, yes this was a gamble, yes we risked our money. But we aren't losing our money because of companies like BB, GME, AMC or NOK. We're losing our money because hedge funds are completely manipulating the market in a last resort to saving face. This literally is fraud at this point, tell me how all of our stocks are down today (other than gme) and all the stocks that were down supported by hedge funds are all up today. The fact that robinhood can physically block the purchase of stocks should be illegal and I can't wait to sign a class action against their asses and I hope they lose a fuck ton of money. Everyone is working against us, against the 99%. Now of all times, we need to stick together, we need to buy BB, AMC, GME and NOK and prove that this won't be tolerated. Let's take them out of business, retards.
Do NOT PANIC! GME and AMC, etc are going to go down because of how many platforms have halted trades of these stocks. Find a new platform ASAP (E Trade) and continue to buy and hold!
The suits think they beat us by restricting our buying power, but we will bounce back. BUY AND HOLD!
Guess I am holding!

Hold, the dip is manipulated
GUYS Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.  It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.  DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.  These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.  Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.  Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.  This is a repost!!!!!!
IF YOU SELL, WE WILL BUY AGAIN NOSTOP HOLD!!!!!
Apps are crashing, keep on selling, we will buy again and we won't stop !!!!!

Support tickets are expensive
Support tickets cost businesses real $$$, it represents a huge annual operational cost for tech companies.  Depending on the cost of the onshore or offshore support center being used to manage inbound tech support questions from customers, it can cost a company between $1 and $10-$15 per support ticket. This is called ‚Äúcost per contact‚Äù.   It‚Äôs usually more expensive if you write in in another language and they have to outsource your question to another country.  Filing support tickets to any business is another way to put pressure on them aside from app ratings.  Source - I was a customer support manager for a tech company

How many of u guys use Robinhood?
We need to figure this out. I have feel like the majority of people in here use it. If that is true we all need to unite and use something different. If nobody is buying the stock it won‚Äôt go up! There needs to be a huge revolt. We can‚Äôt buy amc bb or gme on Robinhood right now and we can‚Äôt just quit cuz of some dumb company
WEALTHSIMPLE IS BLOCKING $BB BUY ORDERS
Mass manipulation in CAN too. This is EXACTLY why this movement is so important
I am not a smart man so tell me if this is a bad idea.
So sometimes I make profit on GME, what if I sell once its profitable, buy back at the dip with my initial money and profits and sell again when its profitable and keep doing that? Idk, everyone saying hold hold hold so I'm down to hold no problem lol, i just figured this is something i could do too.
THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU STAY IN
WE LIKE THE STOCK, RIGHT? TOMORROW IS THE DAY. BUY LOW (THE DIP) SELL HIGH (THE SWEEZE)
Help!!
We are going to be buying GME today because of the drop and the insane shares on it to help out fight Melvin but everyone is saying don‚Äôt use Robin Hood what app do I use?
This is the most important thing that many of us have ever been a part of. This is far from over. We are just beginning.    WRECK THE SHORTS
ALL IN ON NAKD! They can't stop us.
Get some GME as well.
AMC is down to $8 today. This is not just about a short squeeze, this is a value play.
More support for the cause!
Guess im finding my wife a new boyfriend
HOLD!! Don't let them get away with this!
cant wait for buys to open again
they are going to get so many people buying these stocks, I don't even care that I've lost $4K since yesterday, its going to bounce so hard once the majority of investors can get back in...
AMC. BB. GME. Hold or buy. Do not sell shares of any of these. Hedge funds are using all of them to offset eachother. DO NOT SELL ANYTHING.
EUROPEANS CAN STILL BUY GME, BB!
its simple, SIP THE DIP!  100 BB shares and climbing
Canadian here. Still seeing issues with buying GME NOK BB AMC. took an hour and a half to process. DO NOT SELL. WALLSTREET TRYING TO SILENCE. $300  üèº gme bb amc NOK
DO NOT FALTER we will be strong. This dip only means BUY MORE.
Dollar Cost Averaging is a well-practiced, advised, precedented
How do you do DCA if the brokerage companies only permit you to sell, and this market manipulation benefits the billionaires, brokerages, shorters, and basically just fucks over everyone else?  They're using it to drive prices down, but at the same time the normal people cannot average their investments.  This is a painful, expensive, unfair tactic.  What can people do about it?
Do RH and Citadel have unlimited legal liability for their blatant manipulation?
Before restricting trading, this stock had, and still has, unlimited upward potential due to the short squeeze. By halting trading, have they just exposed themselves to an equivalent amount of legal liability?
What they're doing right now is trying to scare you. We stay in this together. Whatever you're holding, HOLD. THIS IS HOW WE MAKE THEM BLEED.
$GME      $NOK      $BB      $AMC
Holding NOK!
To Robinhood and the like- Thanks for the dip I guess?   Got some NOK, will be holding this long. Good luck to all!
HOLD! Don‚Äôt fall for their BS.
Don‚Äôt lose faith in $GME, $AMC, $NOK, $BB, ETC. Given the current attention the sub/GME has gotten, shorts on the verge of burning, suspending trading and brokers blocking trade options they‚Äôre trying to sink before they have to eat their fucking dinner.  Buy the damn dip and HOLD.  This   is just taking off and they‚Äôre doing everything in their power to stop us.   If you sell, they win. Don‚Äôt fall for it.   This isn‚Äôt financial advice I just really like these stocks. And my wife‚Äôs boyfriend.
I won't leave my brothers behind. This is the ENDGAME. I really like this stock!
Anyone still believe Melvin Capital closed its short position yesterday? Anyone who lied to you about that is probably lying to you know.
Anyone still believe Melvin Capital closed its short position yesterday? Anyone who lied to you about that is probably lying to you know.  This is an Epic short squeeze and there is no limit to the amount hedge funds can lose if they continue to prop up the shorts.  Force them to close their short positions
Can we make a list of exchanges to avoid?
Yesterday a handful of exchanges halted trade on meme stocks, and today even Robinhood has done the same. This is not something we can just forget. Is there anyway we could compile a list of exchange apps that are currently or in the past have blocked trades on meme stocks? Personally I wouldn't wanna use an anti-retail investment app even if all of this wasn't going on, so I'm sure people will appreciate having the list in the future too. So far the only ones I know for sure that halted buys were trading212 and Robinhood.
Regretting Per Usual
Regretting Per Usual  Just like when I told myself bc was too high at $9,000 I am now regretting not investing in GME when an account I follow on IG was strongly recommending to at $35 a share. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è congrats to everyone who wasnt dumb like me though üôè do y‚Äôall think it‚Äôs going to drop anytime soon?
AMC NOK AMC
I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARENT ABLE TO GET ONTO THE GME WAVE FOR THE TIME BEING BUT DONT FORGET NOK AND AMC ARE DIRT CHEAP AND ARE ACCESIBLE ON CASHAPP AND OTHER APPS!!!!!  FOR THE ONES WHO GOT IN EARLY FOR GME  HOLD IT LIKE YOUR HOG AFTER A TOUGH DAY AT WORK AND DONT LET GO!!!!!!!  THEY CANT FUCK THEM ALL
Americans cant buy GME, BB and AMC! Europe Lets get this rocket going
Go help te people in   to get the stock price higher! Let wall street know! Lets go buy them stocks! Lets get this rocket going
What trading apps do you guys recommend
What Robinhood did today was pure MANIPULATION
FUCK ROBINHOOD.  UNINSTALL THE APP AND MOVE OVER! IF THEY AINT WITH IS, THRY ARE AGAINST US!
banana mine
No sell
Robin Hood stealing from the poor and giving it to the rich üñï
For now, buying GME is still possible in Belgium!
So I went for it!
EVERYONE DONT SELL BUY ALL THE GME, BB, NOK, AND AMC YOU CAN. HOLD OFF DONT GIVE IN TO THESE BULLSHIT TACTICS
STAY STRONG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THIS IS OUR TIME GODDAMMIT, WE MUST NOT ALLOW STOCK MARKET MANIPULATION TO BRING US DOWN NOW. THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE MONEY ANYMORE, LETS SHOW THESE BASTARDS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT.
What market manipulation looks like. HOLD. Buy more when possible. And DO NOT SELL.
As Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said in a note early Wednesday, "The question I have is whether this [market dynamic is] a fascinating curiosity, or whether it‚Äôs indicative of a larger problem for global markets in 2021."
What's the best way for someone who has never invested before to get in on this craziness?
I've never invested before and all this gme stuff has me interested. Any tips?
I purchased AMC last night on stash and it's still pending. Wtf?
If they closed option to buy GME how will be able to sell if nobody can buy?
DON'T GIVE IN YOU IDIOTS, THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO
That is all, stop selling the BB and GME, collectively holding is the way to go.
I bought GME at $400 - my first ever transaction - going to the moon or to the gutter?
My first ever transaction today, bought GME at $400, down already 2000 dollars but fuck it, i won‚Äôt sell, not sure why but i‚Äôll hold until another degenerate tells me to sell.   Will i eat grass this month or we feastin?
HEY! Im new but interested in the stock market. Help?
Hey there! Im a late 17 year old who got his first job last year, i have recently taken great interest in the stock market but i have some questions.  1. How can i participate?  2. What should i look at and seek to know?  3. What are the terms and what do they mean? Holding, squeezing, shorts, etc.  4. Are there any questions i should be asking that i havent? If so, what are the answers?
HOW TO BUY $GME IF YOUR BROKER BLOCKS YOUR $GME ORDERS
Your broker may have blocked your orders for GME. Fuck them. But there are ETFs and funds out there that also hold GME and will buy GME for you.  Now, RETL holds the most in GME out of other ETFs (16%)  .  This is called replication or synthetic. It's what Wall Street does when they block you from buying GME. If you can short, you can also short the other holdings (SFIX) in the ETF and use that money from shorting to buy more RETL and gain more exposure to GME.
DO NOT FOGET YOUR RETARD BROTHERS IN AMC and NOK                ü§≤ü§≤ü§≤ü§≤ü§≤
Ironically, my first GME share (and first stock ever) was my free one from Robinhood! $1000 for free!
Long time   just sunk what I have into GME
I'm not one to post   I just wanted to come here to say I just dumped what few stonks I owned and put it back into $GME. I'm sick of wall street fucks thinking they can do whatever it is they want with no repercussions so I'm doing what I can to help relieve them of at least one of their boats.   God speed you autist fucks!
The Market Makers are pulling the Prisoner's Dilemma on us! Don't let them get away with that.
TL;DR for marble brains at the bottom so your wife's boyfriend can read it to you like he did to me.  For anyone who isn't familiar with the dilemma you can read up more in depth   . But who am I kidding, we don't know how to read nor do we have the time to do so. But for the rather curios i'll try to break it down in a nutshell:  Two Criminals got caught but the there is not enough evidence to prove their wrongdoing, so the suits try to pull a trick on them, by offering each of them a deal for a lowered sentence if they betray the other guy. Both of them are isolated so they can not speak to each other and each one is told the other one gets the same deal. To put more pressure on them they also do tell them, if the other one takes the deal first, theirs will be void.    So the outcomes are as follow:    If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison   If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison   If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free   If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).     If you read this far, you might wonder how this relates to the current situation. Well, Robin Hood and a bunch of other Apps got on their knees to suck some cocks under the table in order to keep us away from our tendies by restricting buying but not selling of $GME, $BB and $AMC. We are now the "prisoners" here and by  ü§ö we give them what they want. But if we   ü§≤ like our prophet DFV they got nothing on us and everything comes cracking down on them. Also after this little stunt i sure hope RH has invested in $ROPE cause they gonna need it.   See you on $Mars fellow retards     TL;DR:   ü§≤ GME
Naked Enough?
Naked Brand could use some support rn   about to break a new bottom, need push up to 5 or $50!!
Want to file an SEC complaint against RH or any of their other corrupt brokerages!? (Link below)

GME halted, opened for 10 seconds to trigger trades at $300 and immediately halted again @10:47ish.   Feels like clear manipulation to me.
YOU CAN STILL BUY GME BB NOK BBBY AMC THROGH FIDELTIY/BROKERS OTHER THAN ROBINHOOD
THIS MEANS SETUP AN ACCOUNT WITH ONE OF THEM UNTIL THIS ROBINHOOD BS IS FIGURED OUT AND BUY BUY BUY. ADAPT IDIOTS, WERE STILL IN THIS.
BUY THE DIP        BREAKING NEWS HEDGE FUNDS ARE SCARED SHITLESS AT PROSPECTS OF BANKRUPTCY

GameStop is dead on cashapp now
Rip
Robinhood is restricting trades but DO NOT PANIC. Robinhood has revealed their true colors but they are not the only game in town. DO NOT SELL. JUST KEEP HOLDING GME.
This is just part of their game plan at this point. The hedge funds are truly desperate. Just keep holding. Holding is how we win.
It was never about Thursday. It‚Äôs Friday and beyond. Hold. The. Line. ‚úäüèΩ
Anyone else jump on the hype train and get royally derailed and crash in flames today? Lessons were learned
Lots of drama this morning. Upvote this for a friendly reminder to stay calm and hold. It will be another victorious day, same as yesterday, tomorrow and the following weeks.
Cashapp is allowing purchases of NOK
Wall Street Bullshit
Thank you for sending a clear message that the game is rigged. Like all the brokers Interactive brokers changed their policy to sell only with absolutly no notice for the retail invertor. This is not only fucking ppl who wanted more of the stock but also this is making us lose unrealized profits. Brokers, you have one job and it is not to regulate the market. #Rant
GME can be bought on Vanguard BTW
FOR ALL RETARDS BUY FOCKING NOKIA !!!
As DFV predicted GameStop a year ago, I now predict it's dead in 6 days. Nokia is the new wave. GameStop and AMC are absolutely not systemically important. The telecom networks that Nokia builds are. That is why we are going to make the company bigger by buying their shares. My fucking warriors won't sell Nokia until it reaches the moon. If you're a noobie and don't have faith in it, leave this Subreddit. And buy damn pennystocks at RobinHood, because that‚Äôs where you fucking belong! Together with all these retards on this subreddit, we're going to get rich. Leave all your money troubles behind. So, you listen to me and you listen well. Are you behind, on your credit card bills? Good. Buy Nokia and push it to the moon. Is your landlord ready to evict you? Good. Buy Nokia and push it to the moon. Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? Good. Buy Nokia and push it to the moon! I want you to deal with your problems by getting rich! All you have to do today ... Buy Nokia and push it to the moon. This subreddit will make you richer than the most powerful CEO of the United States of fucking America. I want you to go out and grab everyone by the throat to buy Nokia stock. Until they choke on it and have to buy 100,000 Nokia shares! We can only do this together.
I missed the memo to get out of amc we riding it to the bottom its been fun
AMERITRADE STILL SEEMS TO BE ALLOWING GME, AMC, ETC
I just bought more AMC as the GME rockets left me a while ago Godspeed
ITS NOT LOSS IF YOU DONT SELL
Guys, I know it is tough rn, but fuck them.  Hold that shit. Hold it tight. Its only loss if you sell low rn. We attacked, they fought back. Its a war, we will prevail and eat tendies in Valhalla
I lost more then 60% of AMC, Still BUYING THE $7 DIP

Don't Forget Our Main Goal Here - HOLD GME
With all the recent controversy surrounding RH and fake news, it's now more important than ever to hold GME. This is a blatant attempt by hedge funds to manipulate the markets and get the price back down, and while they think they can control us, they underestimate the strength of us retards. Don't be a paper hand bitch and sell, we need all the strength we can get.  HOLD FUCKING GME AND STICK IT TO THEM IT'S NOT ABOUT PROFITS ANYMORE IT'S ABOUT PREVENTING 1984. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING US AND THIS ISN'T A FIGHT WE WILL LOSE.
Park your GME cash in SRPT
Park your GME cash in SRPT  You‚Äôre a fresh tard here and you aren‚Äôt used to getting screwed. Well let me help you lube up. You want to take GME profits out of Robinhood because they‚Äôre just sitting around collecting dust. Well you don‚Äôt have to. Cathie Woods, aka Aunt MOTHERFUCKING Cathie, is loading up a ton of ARKG into SRPT. Why? I don‚Äôt fucking know. Well, I do actually. It dropped 50% a couple weeks  ago, well below its value. Now it‚Äôs primed to go to the fucking moon cause it has new drug trials on the horizon. The tutes won‚Äôt block this stock because they want it to succeed. It‚Äôs the safest bet you can make right now if you have too much GME money and you don‚Äôt know what to do with it. Park you cash in SRPT and let‚Äôs blast off to a tendie covered moon.  More extensive DD on my profile from a week ago. It has links and shit, real classy. Bye, Bitch.
GME HOLD!!! Hold my family together GME!!! HOLD!!!
HOOOOOOOOLD!
THE IRONY OF THE APP ROBINHOOD, TAKE FROM THE RICH AND GIVE TO THE POOR BUT STOP THEM ONCE THEY START MAKING MONEY?! DONT SELL UNTIL $10,000.    üèº
Now that robinhood pulled that little stunt, what alternatives should we use?
I might never go back to robinhood.
We didn't forget - America's billionaires got $  trillion wealthier during the pandemic
The pandemic that our government completely bungled the response to and left average Americans facing record unemployment. Now you're upset we're using out $600 stimmies to help ourselves more than the government ever cared to help us when our friends and family members were dying? The only bad people here are the hedge fund big money boomers who are trying to con us into thinking we're committing a crime for turning a tiny profit on a brick and mortar video game store.    I am never selling. This is beyond just money. This is principle. Maybe you'll finally learn not to fuck with the 99% because it seems you've gotten a little too comfortable.
Trading212 has changed their minimum deposit
So if you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôre using Trading212 because you COULD deposit as little as ¬£1, a thing it prided itself on - you can‚Äôt anymore. They‚Äôve increased the minimum deposit to ¬£100 when markets opened in the US.
Ehmm, what?
H O L D ! We will win this war
GME price dipped again. Scared? HECK NO! I‚Äôm in it to win it. Make these elites cry over their billions disappearing
Citadel/Melvin/gme
Citadel does order flow for Robin Hood.  Citadel is trying to bail out Melvin.  This is fucking rigged game.
There is clearly a MAJOR issue here, what do we do to actually fix it?
Between CNBC spreading misinformation and blatantly taking the side of hedge funds, and Robinhood preventing users from spending their money to freely purchase stocks in a free market, I am really disgusted.  Where do we go from here? There will certainly be legislation and litigation around this. How do we as a community positively impact this in a way that protects retail investors and not "the big guys"?
Dave is angry. I love the Dave
Pretty sure the shorters are trying to attack it all day! Hoooooold!

To ALL those targeting ROBINHOOD with actions (SEC Complaints, Reviews, Lawsuits, Etc) - Know this was Calculated; AIM FOR THE HEAD: ‚ÄúCitadel‚Äù is the problem!!!!
ROBINHOOD and the apps are just the arms.  Learn from Thor‚Äôs Mistake - AIM FOR THE HEAD
What apps should we be using to buy right now?
Robinhood, WeBull, Cash App aren't letting me buy anything.
Fuck robinhood, who wants to work together with me to build a platform that will never sell out to the suits
Fuck robinhood, BB and GME to the moon
ROBINHOOD TOOK $NAKD OFF THEIR SITE
I just bought shares yesterday and apparently I can not buy anymore more. They just completely took it off.
I‚Äôm not that into the whole concept of stocks, but what you guys have done is commendable
I don‚Äôt really like the concept of stocks, and people riding them to fortune, but what you guys did with GameStop is insane. You blew it out of the park. You almost bankrupted a major firm. A little gaggle of fuckers on Reddit cost some bigwigs up the chain billions of dollars. I have to commend you on that. Good job dudes.
Went with CTRM and SNDL and holding now, you guys ?
There hiding all the tendies from   all day baby get in on the run before they lock it out!
FCEL           ... THAT IS ALL
Losing my head on SNDL.
Was able to get in at $  this morning before it got blocked up. Now I'm down $50 bucks. Are people not able to buy in?
STOP SELLING U RETARDS DO U LIKE TO LOSE?!
AMC?
Is AMC still worth holding? Is there a chance at resurgence?
Robinhood app just got removed from the Play Store
You get what you fucking deserve
NOK on the rise, dip maybe ending last change to get in
BUY and HOLD
F ck Robinhood
They really messed up. This is the time to hold and make sure there‚Äôs nothing they can do except watch the hedge funds lose billions of dollars. HOLD HOLD HOLD until Robinhood files for bankruptcy.

Let's squeeze some lemonade. they can't stop us from buying
Stop getting tricked to sell!!! HOLD IT!
FOLKS Stop selling!!! What are you doing! Just hold it!!!!! My God. It's simple you hold they lose. You sell they win.
Let our voices be heard!
We are smart, responsible people. I have the contact information for some of the  C-level over at Robinhood.   Let them hear it! Do not threaten them, do not harass just send them articulate messages or call being polite but to the point. You can not stop the free market! You can not stop us from the financial revolution!       COO   (321) 541-9434 (Direct)        CFO         CCE (chief Customer Experience)           CCO (chief compliance officer)
Remember ! Volkswagen dipped from 400 before taking off too.
What app to use besides Robinhood?
Robinhood is trying to prevent me from being retarded and I don't appreciate that.   What apps are still allowing you to buy GME stock?
I finally figured out how to buy again since RH is gay. Should I still go for GME and AMC even if amc is falling off hard?
Options price not moving? Robinhood
I bought put options on AMC at 19 just to hedge myself for a big drop...  The price went down to .01 on my options and hasn‚Äôt moved. Obviously they are manipulating the fuck out of this, but they also rejected my sell limit orders...  Eventually this has to correct itself right?
So they want to block buys, eh?
What if I stopped trading for a week... Maybe some of my colleagues would catch on and follow suit. Just as much as they may have the ‚Äúright‚Äù to block our buys, I have the right to stop trading for a time. It‚Äôs my money anyways.   Think about this folks! If they‚Äôre scared as shit now, imagine if everything drops from the same lack of demand that they‚Äôve been simulating with market holds. The people control the market, not Wall Street!   I am not a professional, take my ideas as a grain of salt. However, do keep in mind that we have other ways of showing the power of the people.
AMC - Hold and buy the dip
Big dip because some retards are too pussy to hold  Buy the dip and hold to the moon
Holding stocks like $GME $AMC and $BB isn't good enough. KEEP BUYING TOO!!
Increased my position multiple times today. You need to do the same!!
Ive always stood up for the ones who are too scared, I cannot any longer stand up for you weaklings, if you have sold your shares, you are weakest scum
Fuck these mods. Fuck RH. "Take the hit like a man"? Fuck right off.
We all see where the mods true interests lie. No, I will not take my hit like a man. I will rate Robin Hood as I please.   This sub deserves to be taken down.  Ban me. I don't give a fuck.
DON'T SELL REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE FUCKERS AT ROBINHOOD ARE DOING OR WEATHER ITS DIPPING, THIS IS ABOUT MAKING A POINT
The 1% have oppressed small traders for decades and received Billions in bailouts in 2008. This is a once in a lifetime moment. This is where you can make a REAL difference. Don't cave into the Corporate fat suits or the Hedge funds, hold and all will be well.+
Buy SNDL
Its gonna boom
If there ever was a time to get into $AMC, the time is now
Please do not get rid of any GME to buy AMC, but for the love of god please do not get rid of AMC to buy GME. AMC is at   at the time of this post. The retards on the western shores need you!     Hold strong and hold long!
Did AMC just halt again after only rising like $
So AMC was halted after dropping a decent 30%, when it resumed and only rose like $  it was halted again. What's the reason for this?
How can we Petition the SEC to disallow the blocking of security buys?
Seriously. Tell me and I'll fucking do it.  I can't find a good answer in searches.
So now that the big dogs are but hurt, thus controling the market again. Is it time to turn to cryptos...?
A community of   million members, Im sure someone here could make an app like Robinhood thats easy to use and not a clusterfuck
THEY SUPPORTED IT YESTERDAY
We figured it out.
Pool your talents, WSB
If Robinhood is pulling the plug, and you have millions of members now, I say create your own trading app. Use your network now to finish the revolution. You want to take $GME to the moon? The elites are now trying to stop you. Your resources are vast and your talent apparent. I say get a group together, make your own app (and honestly, WallStreetBets is a killer app name) and make the move. Then, literally NO ONE will be able to stop you.
Well this is fun

yeah this is kinda lame now.. :/ thought i was sticking it to the man but the man i just sticking it back
SIRI TIME
Vote with your money, move it out of Robinhood unless they do right by us
Moving everything out of Robinhood (except the GME and BB I already have). This is NOT right. They should not be able to manipulate the market like this. I will vote with my money and as soon as this is over canceling my account with Robinhood. Unless they can do right by their users. They should be protecting OUR rights.
Don‚Äôt fucking sell. I repeat Don‚Äôt
You‚Äôll regret it.
DO NOT SELL AND GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT! HOLD
Do not sell your shares to these fuckers

What to do about amc?
What happens now?  Edit: Buy and stay diamond handed
Legal action against Ally Bank?
This is two days in a row that they‚Äôve been down since market opening. Once 6:30am (PT) it shut down. That‚Äôs sus af. Not selling GME but I do have other positions I want to trade.   I read people want to leave Robinhood. 10/10 do not recommend Ally Bank/Invest
If I download E TRADE right now to buy GME, won‚Äôt it take days for my money to transfer? Trying to buy GME
AMC tanking. Makes sense. It was always about GameStonk anyway.
DO NOT SELL UNTIL AT LEAST 3 HEDGEFUND MANAGERS HANG THEMSELVES, THIS IS WAR
What can the average idiot like me do to report Robinhood right now??
Is there somewhere we can file a complaint or something to alert the SEC that Robinhood traders have their hands tied? I feel like a high volume complaint may get the assholes to let us buy again.
Robinhood and Webull can Kiss my ass
Can we as a community create a brokerage fund that doesn‚Äôt completely manipulate the market buy blocking everyone‚Äôs ability to buy a stock, but allowing everyone to close out their positions? WTH is that? Is there already a brokerage I should be moving to, looking for any and all idea. After this run I‚Äôm moving my funds somewhere.
Used Webull to Buy more GME!
Robinhood is absolute criminal for what they done. I Have invested all I could to help support the cause. I just opened an account with WEBULL and bought $1000 more of GME. I know it‚Äôs not much but it‚Äôs all I have left to buy and every little bit is helping.  I currently have 50k tied up in Robinhood... my account has gone from +8000 to -$6800. But I am HOLDING EVERYTHING
Hey Guys I am totally new to this. Should I invest in Gamestop or Blackberry?
DONT SELL
RETARDS WHY ARE YOU SELLING. YOURE GIVING MONEY TO THE HEDGE FUNDS
Losing a lot of money on GME,NOK and BB
Do I hold on? Lost a 3rd of my money...
IM NOT SELLING!  ü§≤üèº $GME
I think it would be a good idea to all come together and report platforms like robinhood for manipulation.
I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall, but I went from big green to big red in an instant. They will not win. We need to come together and show them who is really boss. We must win this fight!
How any retail investor app can make bank!
Due to all the negative press around Robinhood. All Webull needs to do is a release a statement about how they are giving power to the players or something to that effect. And bam thousands of new customers
File your formal complaints, boys. It‚Äôs lawsuit season.
THIS IS MANIPULATION. HOLD
#THIS IS NOT AN ORGANIC DROP THIS IS MANIPULATION. YOU SHOULD BE USED TO THIS BY NOW AND YOU HAVE ONE THING TO DO. HOLD LIKE YOUR FUTURE DEPENDS ON IT BECAUSE IT DOES!!!!!!           THIS DROP DOES NOT REPRESENT ITS REAL VALUE ITS TO SCARE YOU!!!!!!   #FEAR IS THE MIND KILLER
STOP SELLING WE NEED TO HOLD THE LINE
How do I know what WSB will target next?
Hi, the recent spike of GME from $70 to $350 dollars amazed me. I just need to know if I am missing something but where do you guys discuss your target stocks?
AMC halted on the way back up...
It's pretty clear forces are acting against it. If the last two weeks are any indication, it's not going to be held down. My price target is >$20 EOD
IM DOIN MY PART!
My Personal Opinion, and I am not a financial advisor in any aspect, is that this is a concerted effort to force everyone to sell before puts expire tomorrow
I will not speak for anyone else but plan to hold and buy more. Those that are constrained will move their money to platforms that can't. The hedge funds cannot win if you don't sell. This is the game they have been playing since forever and they couldn't beat us legally so now they forced, ironically the day before expiry, some platforms to ban the tickers knowing people will sell and they can cover their puts.  I am not selling
If you cant buy these stocks anymore buy other shorted stocks like SPCE or IDEX! We cant be stopped they cant block all stocks!!! One by one we gonna screw them all!
APES STRONG TOGETHER
Added motivation, fuel for the fire

Dirty play again

THIS MOMENT IS FUCKING CRITICAL, KEEP BUYING OR WE LOOSE THIS BATTLE  REVOLUT IS WORKING EUROBROS
Dear SEC,
As punishment for these brokerages and Hedge funds, please make them pay for the next stimulus package  Sincerely, Everyone
TD Ameritrade and Robinhood are blocking GME, AMC, and are losing this customer. Who should I switch to?
TD Ameritrade and Robinhood are blocking GME, AMC, and are losing this customer. Who should I switch to? I haven't traded more than about $10k at a time.

SEC complaint page:    Robinhood contact page:    FINRA complaint page:    Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. I am not a financial advisor. I am not a fiduciary. I am a just a retail investor.  As of this post, Robinhood has locked out buying on various stocks including GME. In my opinion, this is clear, deliberate and unethical attempt at market manipulation.  I‚Äôve left the links unmasked for those that wish to copy and paste them elsewhere. You have my permission to do so. I prefer you do not credit my username so my inbox isn‚Äôt flooded.
We'll see....
Better bounce back
Words can‚Äôt express the frustration and anger I‚Äôm feeling right now. This Robinhood BS needs to stop.
Why did the mods keep removing posts about the Disc0rd server?
Who's the MADMAN that put this on their site?
How are we not in the OTC market yet?
HOLD THE LINE
THIS IS SPARTANS VS PERSIANS DONT LOWER YOUR SHIELDS
Schuab sold my buddies GME position without his permission.
He didn‚Äôt have any triggers or orders. They sold it without telling him, at significantly lower than the going price.
FYI: AMCX is not AMC
Accidentally selected it, saw it was up, realized it wasn't the right thing.   However it is up a lot. Which is dumb, because there is no news leading me to believe it's fat finger trades.  This is kinda like what happened with Signal a few weeks ago.
GME - eeerrm should I be worried right now?
Have I bought in too late? I‚Äôm down considerably at the moment
Fidelity has zero commission and no restrictions on GME, AME, anything
I make no money off this, I just hate Robinhood for this.  Keep $10 in Robinhood for their platform views if you like it but F them.  Fidelity has stated they won't restrict accounts.  I confirmed it and am asking them to release a public statement on it.   Here is how to request a transfer out of Robinhood.      Here is how to set up Fidelity and transfer to Fidelity    I don't care who you go to, but make sure you check in advance that they will do your trades and won't restrict.

WHY IS GME GOING DOWN?? DONT GET SCARED. MAKE THOSE   üèº

Robinhood statement is BS
DO NOT SALES. They trying to make sure sell buy you can't buy so the market will flood with stock none is buying, Hold like your life depends on it. To the moon
MARKET MANIPULATION ROBINHOOD
Let's be clear about something, there was very likely a conversation with these hedge funds that the price is too high to take it out. They want the price to go down so they too it out of the market. Well, they can get fucked, there should be a class-action lawsuit on this 10000000%. We need to know was there a conversation with these hedge funds prior to removing from marketplace!!!!  Edit: for last sentence
BUY THE DIPPPSSSSS AMC BB GME
BUY THE DIP
BUY AS MUCH GME, BB, NOK, AMC, NOW WHILE YOU CAN (IF YOU CAN). ONCE PEOPLE CAN FREELY BUY AGAIN ITS GONNA EXPLODE.
To everyone who is selling
You do not deserve to be part of this community. It might be only money for you, but this is way more than that. For centuries poor people have been repressed by the elites, and this is happening now more than ever before. We finally have a way to protest.   Sure you might cash in some profits or you might cut your losses. But you will keep losing your entire life - stuck at a shitty job, working for someone else and giving him your precious time.   I am personally losing -30% of my account, but I refuse to sell. I WON‚ÄôT SELL. THIS IS IT - IT‚ÄôS EITHER A DAY LIKE A KING OR A WHOLE LIFE AS A SLAVE.
Gme is low rn BUYBUYBUY HOLDDDDDD
We need Musk!
WE need Elon to reinforce our holding walls with a tweet! HOLD!!
ITS OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
AMC SUSPENDED??? REALLY???

Possible reason for GME dip?

To those who are unable to buy on American based trading apps
Make a switch. Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, etc... don‚Äôt deserve our business. This is a historic moment in our history and I‚Äôm not stopping. Just switched over to WeBull a couple of days ago and trading still works, but there are plenty of other apps.
Robbinhood restricted selling AMC and Gamestop, has this sub picked another company I can buy and hold forever in hopes of hedgefunds shitting themselves? Asking because I am a true retard and can't figure it out for myself.
JA Rule is with us! DO NOT SELL! IT'S MURDAAAAA!

Don't have much but TD is still allowing trades so I'm all in on GME. If anyone wants to venmo me some rocket fuel I will go further in and we will take this to the moon. Even if I lose it was worth it.   Robinhood wont allow me to do anything so moved what I could to TD Ameritrade, but they don't have crypto, if anyone knows where I can move RH money to get back into crypto please let me know.
DO NOT SELL GME THE SQUEEZE HASNT COME YET JUST HOLD ON

If this country's citizen's ever need to agree and unite on something we can all push for, this will be it.
We finally found a pathway to true change and it's going to be because of you guys.
I'm not sure very many of you are going to see this but I just need someone to hear what I have to say:    THE WORLD IS FINALLY PAYING ATTENTION.    2008  was caused by some of the grossest malpractice by Wall Street firms I  have ever seen, and I swear to god I was convinced that some sort of  regulation was finally going to happen and the people responsible for  the fuck up would finally see some sort of justice.  BUT  NAH. The world literally just moved on. Sure the SEC banned CDOs and  over-shorting but as we all know, that did absolutely FUCK ALL. Hell  there was a whole movie made starring some of the biggest actors in  Hollywood detailing EXACTLY how far up your ass these firms and banks  rammed their dildos, but people decided it was too convoluted and too  difficult to understand, so AGAIN, nothing changed. There was no  widespread call for reform, nor any realistic effort at all to make sure  it never happened again.   BANKS TO THIS DAY ARE STILL TRADING CDOs  .  Fuck  was I cynical before all this. I swore that people only cared for  themselves and that if they were comfortable they were complacent. But  holy hell guys, this time it's different.   WE HAVE FINALLY PAVED A PATHWAY TOWARDS MAKING A TRUE DIFFERENCE.    Occupy Wall Street had our level of conviction, but not the knowledge  to direct it anywhere meaningful. But this is different. I REPEAT, THIS  IS DIFFERENT. We have finally found a way to bleed those responsible  right in their jugular, but this is only the beginning. If we're to make  an actual difference then we can't stop with GME. We have to make sure  somehow that when the dust clears and Melvin and Shitron are 6 feet  under that we hold these types of organizations accountable from now on.  The world is watching us and we're for the first time in a position to lead by example, so please,   for the fucking love of god  ,  DON'T LET THIS BE THE END. For your fellow retards and autists, even if  you don't have the money to go in, please, I beg of you, never stop  fighting the good fight. Never stop telling whoever is willing to listen  how hard Wall Street has fucked us and how, in this moment, we finally  found a way to fight back.  I think I realize now that people weren't complacent... they were   hopeless.    It's incredibly difficult to fathom where to even begin fighting back  when you're at risk of going hungry or not having a roof over your head,  on top of the knowledge that whoever you're fighting could bankrupt you  and not even think twice about it. However, I REPEAT, this time it's  different. This time, we're an   informed collective  . We're literally in the spotlight and the entire country is our audience.  It's time to give hope back to the millions of people that had Wall Street steal it from them.  It's   OUR   time to shine.  TLDR;  Wall  Street's fucked us for too long, let's show them how long our schlongs  are. DeepFuckingValue is my God. 10 shares at $97 and   I'M NOT FUCKIN SELLING  .      DIAMOND   MY FRIENDS
EVERYONE HOLD THE LINE!! IM HOLDING DONT PANIC
WE STILL GETTING STARTED    I am not a financial advisor, sorry if this is wrong flair
NKD to hit $4 by tomorrow
My prediction based on thorough stonk research.
Get tae fuck, Robinhood
Never take financial advice from self described retards. GME puts are printing. You want Wall Street's money then load up. Or you can let them take your gains.
Fuck off if you want to ban dissenting opinions. I don't give a shit. This one's for the boys that want to make money.
HOLD HOLD HOLD. I REPEAT HOLD!
STICK IT TO WALL STREET AND DO NOT FOLD!

Can Buy GME on Tastyworks
I saw a bunch of posts about Robinhood blocking buy orders, that is not the case on Tastyworks (assuming trading isn't halted).
Robinhood is not the only broker that limited your free trade you know.... TDA too
Extra liquidity in GME and AMC
Just saw the report that big holdings in GME are going liquid, retail traders are having a hard time buying. Will this limit tomorrow's potential upside?  AMC is converting something like $600m of debt to shares at $13. Also going to kill the bull run with that liquidity.   Just wanted to see what people think.
Why not use WeBull?
Am I missing something? Why doesn't everyone just move to WeBull?

I literally did my own research on this stock, found it on a screener, only news articles were regarding to a recent loan deal they just got, purchased some, and now I'm banned. What's weirder is later I saw a comment and he said he just sold it and was banned too.

Repost for exposure. OP: u/DNXPeeJay
This isnt a Penny stock forum.
We all love the satire and the jokes, The adult playground aspect of this group is the best.  But can we all just stop hyping these stocks like penny stocks? Just post your losses/gains of 2500 or more and stop spamming the shit out of the sub. I literally have GME and AMC burned into my eyes

Pretty much title. Im an american with some money, I like gamestop and I'd like to purchase stock. Help?
Brokerages are not letting orders be processed... This is ridiculous

OK, I think I see what they are doing. There was a low print in the 360s and then it froze there. A couple min later, there was a single trade around 330, and it froze there. They are walking it down artificially, and using halts to interrupt natural trading. In other words, the drop is "fake."
They are fly fishing with   short dump. open. halt. short dump. open.  Can they scare enough into into selling? Remember, they have 5+ to cover, so they aren't even close to out of the woods yet.  Hold the line.
Holding GME and AMC, can‚Äôt wait for the skyrocket tomorrow
These hedgies are getting wedgies tomorrow ü§òüòùü§ò  Glad to be a part of something more than my investment!!!
Jan 15 Short Interest Data is out - latest data point has GME at 226% short to float ratio

That's one thing I can tell you for sure, no matter how much they manage to get it to dip down. More stocks for me and cheaper too!
If RH is gonna play these games why can‚Äôt we just pump another stock? What are they gonna do? Not support every stock on the board?

And it was like, immediately as soon as it became a loss, they cleared it. I‚Äôm fucking livid.  Seems like the bad guys are pulling out all the stops here. What‚Äôs the strategy?

Where to buy GME stock?
I just found out about GME stock and wanted to buy into. I know robinhood is a joke and I downloaded webull but they've suspended their stock. I need some help guys.
Call your brokers and tell them not to lend your shares to the shorters!! That is why everything is bleeding!!
This is what the gay bears want. We aren‚Äôt able to buy, so they start shorting and creating an incredible excess of supply, dropping the price to lower levels. Call your brokers and tell them not to rent your shares to this gay bears.   Leverage down no so that you maximize profits!  Safe trade for all. We are not losing this war.
AMC Company Had Converted   shares
‚ÄúAMC said Thursday a group of investors including units of private-equity firm Silver Lake have opted to convert all $600 million of the cinema chain's   convertible senior notes due 2026 into Class A common shares, at a conversion price of $  a share.‚Äù  So the company itself just got screwed.
Cashapp is blocking my purchase of AMC. It might just be me but figured I‚Äôd let y‚Äôall know. Be aware.
AMC IS COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD üíÄ
DD on AMC and BB next week
AMC and BB are incredibly affordable right now. The majority of this sub is unable to buy them on RH, webull and stake. But everyone will transition to better accounts and buy the discount tomorrow. Once it comes back online after a major class action lawsuit is presented, everyone will buy a metric shit-ton and we'll be back to business as usual. Don't let these scare tactics influence our unparalleled autism.
I was lucky and could not create a Robinhood account yesterday when I tried.
Thankfully I had Fidelity there for me, praise to those that aren't succumbing to corporate America. I'm sorry to those that are being held back because of them, but the answer is to by at the dip NOW!   FUCKING HOLD THAT GME MY DUDES
Keep the fight strong degenerates! We're almost through the main gates! The enemy is turning to fear tactics and spewing misinformation. Don't let it deter you! We will fight and we will win!
To those who can hear me I say: do not despair! The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass. And dictators die. And the power they took from the people, will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.  "Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes! Men who despise you and enslave you! Who regiment your lines and tell you what to do, what to think, what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder! Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men! Machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate. Only the unloved hate. The unloved and the unnatural.  "Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty! In the 17th chapter of St Luke it is written, the kingdom of God is within man. Not one man, nor a group of men but in all men. In you! You the people have the power! The power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful! To make this life a wonderful adventure! Then in the name of democracy let us use that power! Let us all unite!

HOLD THE LINES WE'VE ALMOST GOT THESES BILLIONAIRES DRY
Guys selling is what they want
They are trying to scare us by selling off like this. They still have to close all their shorts, what does that mean, they have to buy lots of the stock. They want to scare us into selling so they can buy our stock cheap. If we hold they will still have to buy so the price will go up. I think that‚Äôs what all these price fluctuations are. Surely the price going up is them closing some shorts. Price going down is manipulation..
Webull
Webull has done the same as Robinhood, they‚Äôre only allowing the sell of the shares instead of the purchase. They suspended purchasing, but can only sell? This is applications getting paid off to keep the market from swinging in the meeks favor like with GME and KOSS in specific. They call it a ‚ÄúCool Down‚Äù period? That‚Äôs not a real thing, and it‚Äôs adjustment for inflation. Makes no sense!!! Which 1%ers paid into this?
I'm holding GME! Don't lose hope people! Remember what we are doing!
You can buy GME on Revolut, it was just a market opening issue that you couldn't! Hold the stock!
Do we leave Robinhood for good?

If they get unblocked from trading, WE DOUBLE DOWN
Seeing all these autists hold during this is giving my little sped hands diamond vibes. Thanks for the reminder that if we hold together we win
Forcing us to sell only huh?...
I didn't say I was gonna sell, I'm just saying that's their tactic
Anyone want to make WallStreetBets open source trading platform?

Robinhood Chose The Wrong Side - This Is War
Robinhood CEO said it was good that we felt empowered... Then they blacklisted the stocks made it impossible to buy. They are willing to cave to this pressure. THAT is market manipulation. I HEREBY DECLARE MEME JIHAD ON ROBINHOOD!   List any alternative free trading platforms we can switch to!
IF WE CAVE NOW WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS? HOLD YOUR LOAD AND STAY PUT, WE ARE THE REVOLUTION, WE HOLD THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM, WE ARE REDDIT
HOLD YOUR LOAD AND WAIT FOR BUYING TO OPEN UP AGAIN. WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THIS DROUGHT BROTHERS, IT'S ONLY A TEST OF OUR STRENGTH
When $RH goes public, short them. All of you. On their OWN platform.

If you had doubts at $80, I‚Äôm sorry.  If you had doubts at $150, I‚Äôm sorry.  If you had doubts at $200, I‚Äôm sorry.  If you had doubts at $350, I‚Äôm sorry.  CLEARLY, we can do this thing.  MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS. BUT DON‚ÄôT BE A BITCH.

ROBINHOOD put me on the street. I lost more than half my only saving in BB NOK AND AMC üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™
Ive been unemployed for the past year and haven‚Äôt been able to find work. I had my only savings in BB AMC AND NOK and I lost more than half. I had to sell so I could at least eat. I can no longer afford to pay rent next month and will be living on the streets if I can‚Äôt find a couch to sleep on. It was fun taking this journey with you guys, but I went too far. Good luck

Doesn't Robinhood have an IPO coming up this year?

It's going back up! BUY AND HOLD!!!

Mods please sticky this so people don't panic sell of they intend to get in on the squeeze. Change title when appropriate.

Robinhood allows selling again. Never forget what they did. GME to the moon!

Did RH just give us a list in all the stocks we should invest in?
JUST GOT HERE, PARTY‚ÄôS STARTIN
An outsider saying: thank you!
Thank you, everyone. Screw the ultra wealthy. For once, the little guy is beating them at their own game. I hope all of you continue this with new stocks, finding new ways to make wealth for yourselves and screwing the ultra-wealthy over. They‚Äôve tasted their own medicine and now they‚Äôre pulling every trick in the book to save themselves, tricks that the common man would never have access to. Their hypocrisy is jarring.  I‚Äôm not a participant (though I would‚Äôve picked up a few shares for fun if Robinhood hadn‚Äôt blocked it off), but for everyone like me that‚Äôs watching in appreciation, thank you! Keep it up.
Robinhood Alternatives
Trying to figure out the best alternative now that Robinhood has decided to go against its founding principals.    Fidelity   Webull   E\ Trade   SoFi   Merrill   Ameritradde   InteractiveBrokers  Does anyone have recommendations?
‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èTHE DIPS ARE EXPECTED‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
Whatever you do. Do not sell when the price dips. They are expected and it's supposed to scare us into selling our shares. As long as you dont sell, they are powerless. People are gonna buy the dips and we'll be fine. There's a lot of us that keeps buying at every opportunity. Dont fall for the big boys scare tactics. They live on manipulating people.

I Pledge to Delete RobinHood After The Great Rise. Who‚Äôs With Me?
Let‚Äôs show them how many of their traders are out. These fuckers are set to IPO this year, fools. Who‚Äôs trading data are you gonna sell if all of us leave? Shilling out to big money was the worst financial mistake of your pathetic wanna-be corps life. I‚Äôm out, but I‚Äôm not selling on RH until it‚Äôs motherfucking done. Collect tendies and your tax information and split. Who‚Äôs with me?   GME 5000 is not a meme.  I am not a financial advisor
Stand Up For Us Just One Time You Cowards
All joking aside, this is criminal and hurting me as a retail trader  When this pandemic started they shutdown the country. This hurt the working man, this hurt Main Street.  Meanwhile these multi-billion dollar hedge funds capitalized on the opportunity and made trillions over the past year. Blue collar workers and the small guys were getting laid off.  I happen to be lucky and work for a company that is doing better through all this. My company responded by stopping the match of our 401k and removing our yearly raise. However mad I was about this, I was just happy to have a job.  This on the other hand is bullshit. I jumped on this wild ride because my wedding got moved this past year. We lost thousands of dollars having to move the vendors. It‚Äôs been a really tough year for all of us.  We finally have found the opportunity to make some money on a mistake made by Wall Street. NOT US. Wall Street made the mistake and we‚Äôre capitalizing. They respond by cutting off our balls and not allow us to buy. We can sell our shares and help Wall Street drive the price down.  I‚Äôm sitting here watching the ticker all day, seeing these hedge funds manipulate the market and chip away at the price... meanwhile we can‚Äôt do anything.  Guess what... I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING. You can take all my money away but I don‚Äôt give a fuck. I‚Äôll be a victim if Wall Street, the government, and tech want to collude against the people. I don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore.  Fuck CNBC. Fuck Wall Street. Fuck the Government.  We did not make the mistake! Wall Street did! Why are they getting bailed out when we can‚Äôt. Ever.  Stand up for the little guys your fucking cowards.
HOLD THE STOCK!! DO NOT SELL AT THIS MANIPULATED BIG FINANCE PRICE.
HOLD!!
Robinhood delisted ‚ÄúBB‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlackberry‚Äù from their search bar. Add it to the lawsuit!
DIAMOND HANDS BABY GET THEM BB DISCOUNT SHARES
YOU CAN EITHER CALL ME A RETARD OR A RETARD BUT I CANT STOP LOADING UP ON BB
Can a VPN be used to buy $GME?
I have a VPN (they‚Äôre quite cheap) but I know that Robinhood has our address, so could a VPN be used? My common sense says no but I‚Äôm a retard.
AMC is more than just a meme stock.
Okay, so you loaded up on AMC because you wanted in on the hype. Well now you are regretting everything you‚Äôve ever done and want some reassurance. That‚Äôs why you are here, right?  While it‚Äôs obvious we need to stick it to these hedge funds and big time short sellers, this company has got a real future.  Even if it is down right now, do not sell it at a loss paperboy. This stock will bounce back in a big way.  Major production companies have halted releases of many movies that will be slated for return once theaters open back up. Hollywood is not going to keep taking losses in the hundred of millions by releasing straight to streaming services.  People have gone a year or better without stepping foot inside a movie theater and the ‚Äúdate nights‚Äù and ‚Äúkids movie nights‚Äù are long overdue. People will return in droves after being in quarantine for so long and will be prompted by the increased vaccinations schedule, new/ long awaited releases, and the fact that ‚Äúabsence makes the heart grow fonder‚Äù.
Why does gme keep dropping?
I don‚Äôt understand why it keeps dropping at the rate it‚Äôs going at?
Robinhood is down but Schwab let me in on GME. Time to hold with you all!
GME DIP. Load the fuck up.
Im new here and I wanna ride this to the moon. The thing is I only have enough to buy a couple shares, so when should I expect the biggest dip?
Ya boi just wants to make the most bang for his buck to help pay for college.
EVERY SINGLE SHARE MATTERS
I know what you retards are thinking, your 4 shares or even   shares doesn't matter. I could only afford 4 shares and I was hovering the sell button at that recent 480 peak thinking it's only 4 shares, wont make a difference if I sell.   But then I remembered Im not the only retard with only 4 shares, and if more people like me sell then its easily going to add up to thousands of shares and then we fuck it up for everyone else thats trying to make a difference.   In other words: IF U WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND YOU WANT THE BIG TENDIES YOU DIAMOND HAND EVERY SINGLE SHARE YOU GOT
They have infiltrated us!
Obviously it's not hard but every stock mentioned gets banned in short order. I vote that we mention the entire dow or s&p and shut down robinhood from doing thier normal business?  Do I get a second?  Ps. HOLD THE LINE GME, BB, NAKD
Here's a place to buy AMC! GOOGOGO
PSA: TastyTrade still allowing buy on GME. I'm joining the autists, in @ 300!
Tastytrade owner Tom Sosnoff is naked short on GME and personally feeling Melvin's pain, but still believes in free markets and is not interfering with traders ability to make their own decisions. This is the sort of brokerage I want to be working with!
This feels like Pok√©mon Go, but the only thing we‚Äôre catching are capitalist tears.
Mods, GME needs a sticky thread
UK brothers and sisters Freetrade are still allowing GME BB AMC trading and instant account topups on iOS          to the moon
Charles Schwab Works!
Schwab is working decently, but not blocking trades others are! I bought 30 of AMC this morning, it dropped and lost me a few hundred, I doubled down and jjst bought another 30. May get another 30 depending on if others open up.
HOLD STRONG YOU DIAMOND HANDERS! Scare tactics will not work here

Are These Jumps in Price due to Shorts Covering Slowly, then selling off? Just a Theory                                                                       --
What do we do when the subreddit gets shut down?
Fidelity shows GME at $369 while robinhood is showing the price continually dropping below $290. Is this their tactic to scare RH users to sell?
Is this a cheap tactic to scare RH users to sell? Are they lying about the share price ?
It is crucial to hold now!! This is their last try!!! GME

Care to explain what‚Äôs going on?
Like I‚Äôm 5 please. Errr no maybe 4 would be better. I‚Äôm severely unaware as to why everyone‚Äôs buying GameStop and bed bath stock. To upset someone‚Äôs hedge fund which if I understand correctly is a fund only the rich can own? Why these stocks in particular?
Is this the final battle?    GME
The short typical pay out in the beginning of tomorrow's training day or towards the end? When do I ride that 1k high
These stupid mother fuckers won‚Äôt even let me delete account. Robinhood historically tossed themselves to the depths of no return today.
Can't open accounts with other traders?
This morning I was dealing with the same issues everyone is dealing with, robinhood.  I tried opening accounts through fidelity, e-trade, and a few others. Every one of them had an issue trying to open an account, and account creation failed. They all directed me to a help page.  Is anyone else dealing with this? It seems kind of weird to me that robinhood is having a boatload of problems, and suddenly all the other traders aren't allowing new accounts.
NOK let‚Äôs smash it !!!!! To 8$ on cash app !!!!
Just HOLD
We must buy sndl
It will head to the moon
So I guess we're just giving up on BB?

Interesting note for those of you using Wells Fargo Brokerage:
Tried to buy AMC/GME today on the dip. Got a notice saying that trading was halted. Tried again, and again, and--BOOM, one went through. Did a few tests and found that every trade made on the 10-minute-marks went through (eg 9:30, 9:40, most recent at 9:50).   Hope this helps y'all. Stay frosty.
A divided force is easily conquered. hold.

OH YES ‚Äúmake changes where necessary‚Äù aka we are manipulating the market because the 99% is actually rising up against the 1% for once. Class action lawsuit needs to be filed against RH!!!!  ü§≤üèª ü§≤üèª

Put in orders for GME NOK and BB last night, theyre alll still pending and I can't even get into my account because their servers are shitting their pants.  Call support?

THEYRE GOING BACK UP HOLDDDDDD
You‚Äôll be always poor
Dumped market previous day, glitched and restricted trading on brokerages, shutting down WSB. You think you got freedom huh? They always fuckin win. God damn US treasury can have a million $$ portfolio and still be at helm of economy, a senator can make millions on trading while sitting on decisions that influence it and yet somehow nothing happens. And when ‚Äòturntables‚Äô see the orchestrated move to panic and silence all you fucktards. Keep sulking and being poor with your margin called Robinhood account. Or do not sell.
Try the actual website
It‚Äôs possible they‚Äôre making it harder for people to buy stocks right now. They know a lot of us only use the App. I couldn‚Äôt do shit on my TD Ameritrade App but the website worked. If they can stop the App users , it‚Äôs a win for them.
HOLD THE LINE!!! THEY CAN‚ÄôT BOX US OUT FOREVER!
SPEAK OUT ABOUT THIS MARKET MANIPULATION! The more of us that back our situation, the more we can do! F$@& THESE RESTRICTIONS!
Restrictions on free market trading? Unable to buy more? Saving the filthy rich some of their money, and making us lose ours? This isn‚Äôt okay, we have to speak out.   I urge you to give bad reviews on Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, and whoever else is restricting this trading! Speak out on twitter, instagram, facebook, tiktok, and all social media. We won‚Äôt stand for this.  EMAIL THE SEC WITH COMPLAINTS OF MARKET MANIPULATION, PUT ROBINHOOD AND THE REST AT FAULT FOR THIS!

Bleed. Them. Dry. We win as soon as they have to cover shorts. Even if GME goes down to 100$ they still lose billions. We win in a matter of 1 day or a month
THE WALLSTREETERS ARE CLOSING THE MARKET TO SCARE US SO WE SELL, DONT SELL KEEP HOLDING!!!
Selling is excactly what they want us to do, do the opposite!
Is this even legal..? Entire platforms are preventing people access to a supposedly ‚Äúfree‚Äù market
Is this a class action in the making?  Edit: position = 9x $GME @ avg
Bought alot of AMC shares. Hopefully I make profit
STOP PANICING
Just stop
The name of the app is literally ROBINHOOD someone who took tendies from the rich and gave to the poor. This is messed up!
DO NOT PANIC. AFTER RH BAN IS LIFTED FLOODGATES WILL BE UNLEASHED
After the price is driven down on all of these stocks and they are inevitably opened back up to purchase by the people, it‚Äôs going to rocket back up   stay strong everyone. Hold the fucking line
HOLD FAST LADS THE WORLD IS WATCHING US EVERYONE IS ON OUR SIDE ONE FINAL TEST AND WE REACH VALHALLA. DO NOT SELL. DO NOT CAVE TO THE CON MEN. DO NOT BEND THE KNEE. WE ARE WINNING AND THEY ARE SHITTING BRICKS BECAUSE OF IT. THE PRICE WILL PICK UP. DO NOT BE AFFRAID GME ALL THE WAY

Class action?
Robinhood tanked many people's portfolios by practically ensuring that these stocks can only go down. Doesn't seem very "ethical". Also funny how the Hedge Funds were screaming "think of the little guys!" and are now the ones fucking over those same little guys (again).  Maybe it's time to take the legal route. If anyone sees a way of taking this on with a class action lawsuit, I'm in.
You Are Angry. And You Should Be.
A Relevant Excerpt From "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater," by Kurt Vonnegut
I think it's terrible the way people don't share things in this country. The least a government could do, it seems to me, is to divide things up fairly among the babies. There's plenty for everybody in this country, if we'd only  share  more.  "And just what do you think that would do to incentive?"  You mean fright about not getting enough to eat, about not being able to pay the doctor, about not being able to give your family nice clothes, a safe, cheerful, comfortable place to live, a decent education, and a few good times? You mean shame about not knowing where the Money River is?  "The  what ?"  The Money River, where the wealth of the nation flows. We were born on the banks of it. We can slurp from that mighty river to our hearts' content. And we even take slurping lessons, so we can slurp more efficiently.  "Slurping lessons?"  From lawyers! From tax consultants! We're born close enough to the river to drown ourselves and the next ten generations in wealth, simply using dippers and buckets. But we still hire the experts to teach us the use of aqueducts, dams, reservoirs, siphons, bucket brigades, and the Archimedes' screw. And our teachers in turn become rich, and their children become buyers of lessons in slurping.  "It's still possible for an American to make a fortune on his own."  Sure‚Äîprovided somebody tells him when he's young enough that there  is  a Money River, that there's nothing fair about it, that he had damn well better forget about hard work and the merit system and honesty and all that crap, and get to where the river is. 'Go where the rich and powerful are,' I'd tell him, 'and learn their ways. They can be flattered and they can be scared. Please them enormously or scare them enormously, and one moonless night they will put their fingers to their lips, warning you not to make a sound. And they will lead you through the dark to the widest, deepest river of wealth ever known to man. You'll be shown your place on the riverbank, and handed a bucket all your own. Slurp as much as you want, but try to keep the racket of your slurping down. A poor man might hear.'
AMC SHARES ARE LOW RIGHT NOW
DUMP INTO AMC PEOPLE. $8 A SHARE RIGHT NOW. LETS TAKE IT TO THE MOON
I know it‚Äôs tough but please hold, this is war. We can‚Äôt let Wallstreet win
GME IS HALF OFF BUY IT WHILE YOU CAN (IF YOU CAN)
HOLD THAT MFER TILL THE BITTER END, WE WILL NOT GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT
HOOOOLD GME
Switch to Fidelity??
So far Fidelity seems to be allowing trading of GME and others. Fidelity is unique in that it is   privately held  ; see Wikipedia  .  >Owner     >   >Current & former employees (51%)  This makes me think that Fidelity might be the best brokerage because it's not associated with any hedge funds and does not have conflicts of interest. Sure, their interface is pretty old, but they allow free trading of stocks and options and even allow purchase of fractional shares.  Thoughts?? Should I switch from Robinhood to Fidelity?
THIS IS THE SCARE TACTICS DIAMOND HANDS RISE UP AND TOUCH THE MOON OR MARS
No idea what happened on eToro... but I thought the shit hit the fan just now! Must have been a glitch.
Guys I‚Äôm starting to believe Robinhood may not be on our side
Sounds crazy, but I think I‚Äôm onto something here.
If you sell GME or AMC you're literally a virgin
GO TO THE APP STORE AND FUCK THEIR APP RATING: ROBINHOOD, IBKR, TD, SCHWAB
Keep finding ways to fuck up these suits, we will not let them get away with this. The more they try to save themselves, the more they dig their own grave. Just like how the media tried persuading people not to follow wallstreetbets but ended up boosting members by 3 fold increasing our collective autism and buying power. HOLD!!
Ladder Atacks effect on shorted stocks
Right now we are seing those kind of tactics right?  &nbsp;  Question, this is basically friendly hedge funds selling and buying between themselves in decreasing bid/ask prices to drop the price right?  &nbsp;  In a case where all shares are shorted, with retail vendors holding shares and hedge funds doing ladder atacks with "the same shares" back and forth, decreasing its value, in the end.... they are the same shares, they wont affect the short, its just changing hands and nothing else, all they can get is the shares of people who panic sell and ARENT part of their ladder atack right?  &nbsp;  Another benefit they get is that the volume increases without meaning that they are covering shorts right?  &nbsp;  In the end the efect it has is limited to price, not short ratio right?
We Need To Know Where To Buy
It looks to a newb that there is nowhere to buy GME now. Can y‚Äôall official retards assist? Where should we go?
ILL KEEP SAYING IT HOLD THE LINE THIS WAS THEIR PLAN IF YOU SELL YOURE A BITCH
Shit is cheap right now, find a way to buy and BUY to the     don‚Äôt pussy out and sell at a loss, it‚Äôll go back up. AMC GME BB FUCKING HOLD TIGHT
When if ever do we think Robinhood will allow us to buy GME and AMC again?
So per my last post I am unable to buy any GME and AMC at the moment. I tried opening accounts with various platforms like E-trade however ‚Äúdue to increased volume my submission could not be received...‚Äù That being said what should I do? Find a new platform or wait for Robinhood to stop being such a fucked up entity so I can run with the bulls/boys. Let me know!
Hope you all didn't get scared by the short sell off. There's the bottom. They all got out but we're back in.
Fidelity for people that love stonks and rocket riding
Fidelity is going strong!  I'm having no issues buying or selling here.      I love stocks and I love Fidelity.  I can't make your decisions for you since I'm not a professional nor do I offer professional advise.

What is fucked up is that these people voice their opinion on Reddit etc and it‚Äôs market manipulation but some ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù goes on CNBC speaking to millions of people on the air and it‚Äôs not ?
Noob here. Why Robinhood? Why not Schwab, Fidelity, etc? (Also, obligatory         )
Is there a running list of what institutions are shutting people out of buying $GME?
WHERE THE FUCK IS NOK????
How long does WeBull approval take?
I just managed to finish the application amid all the server issues and it says 1-2 business days, will it really take that long?
Hold Robinhood Accountable!!!
Robinhood is only going to reverse its ban if they are clear that customers won't stand for it and that there will be consequences. Take a look and if you agree, please sign and share. Also, I am going to reach out to the law firms that filed the existing class actions in case RH doesn't do the right thing.
This is BS, Robinhood sucks ####
Notice how they said ‚ÄúYou can close out your position‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou can still sell shares‚Äù this is psychological manipulation ‚Äî this is a sign that we are winning. I will cancel robinhood when I get my god damn tendies.
NOK is at support!! Buy it if you like it, do DD
BEST BROKER TO SET UP TODAY AND BUY ASAP!?
What Broker can I open an account with today and immediately start buying.  I need to avg down on AMC for the sake of my position but Robinhood fucked us all... This is so fucked and so illegal.
PSA: I set up a limit order on Robinhood and they executed it immediately. BEWARE.
Not sure what the hell happened, but my limit order got submitted as a market order and, uh, I got fucked. Worse yet, I can't just buy right back in. BEWARE.
This is a revolution
AMC, BB AND MOST IMPORTANTLY GME WILL BE BACK! HOLD THE LINE
IBKR not allowing to buy GME too.
I got a pop saying only closing positions are allowed on this stock.
Good luck out there Boys
All those holding GME I wish you the best of luck to the stars  To us Nok Holders and AMC, NAKD, BB and others, let's hope were coming up behind them.  EAT THE RICH
How do we still buy AMC and GME?
Does anyone think RH will allow buying more shares? I want to buy the dip at AMC but not sure which apps are still allowing
Post bad reviews of Robinhood everyone, especially app store and play store
Lets take those 5 stars away from these smucks. They are litteraly manipulating the market and this is a way we can get to them.   You guys need to realize how important reviews are for apps, they are everything. There are now 2 million reviews on the app store, we can get that rating down.   Mandatory:
I‚Äôm kinda losing a lot of money rn, how can I be sure that the value is going to at least return to what it was yesterday morning?
Guys I really don‚Äôt have that much money to begin with and right now I‚Äôm down $500 how can I be so sure it‚Äôll go back up?
STOP SELLING

BUYING RESISTANCE AT NOKIA
I‚Äôve bought another 50 shares of Nokia... we‚Äôre resting a resistance and will be shooting to the moon.. Twitter is going crazy
My portfolio is completely shattered
I‚Äôm heartbroken. I made the worst mistake following the trend with the short stocks and now my whole portfolio is shattered in a single day. I was making consistent gains day by day and was so close to my goal.   After thinking there was a get rich quick scheme I ruined it all. I truly am devastated as this was by far the biggest loss I‚Äôve had and I don‚Äôt know what to do.
AMC STARTING TO COME BACK DONT LET THEM WIN
All this just proves, Wall Street is RIGGED
Sorry, but all this nonsense with major brokerage firms BLOCKING people from buying/selling stocks, options, etc in the supposed "free market capital of the world" ... we see now its all just a facade, and really just BS. There absolutely should be a class action lawsuit against this kind of BS.
Physical Silver to the MOOOOON
Physical Silver is going to go to the moon, but don't get paper silver. Most ETFs where you can buy silver (AG, SVR) do not hold real silver, and thus are much more susceptible to shorts. JP has a history of Spoofing on their metals desk, where they hold massive short positions for silver. They are using the shorts to keep prices low as they collect physical silver. they can then unload their shorts with paper once everyone realizes that physical silver is much harder to come by.   Physical silver is currently being consumed by tech manufacturing at a rate much higher than it is being produced. This is creating a demand crunch, but is not reflected in silver prices due to the vast amount of paper sponsored by shorts. Most analysts agree Silver should be trading closer to 120. TIME TO SHOOT THIS BADBOY TO THE MOOOOOOON! But only buy physical.

GME is not on cash app and never was please don't mistake it not being there for them being complicit in RH TD BS. But you can help the brothers in the trenches holding on for dear life right now, we are going to take Normandy beach from the hedge fund nazis.
WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT?
Trading212 did the same thing
It's not just Robinhood, Trading212 did the same thing, they should get lawsuits as well!
Now that Robinhood blocked GME and BB... what do we buy?
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS BUT IM SELLING AT 10K MINIMUM, ALL OR NOTHING!
I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVE. GME GOES ON.    APES TOGETHER STRONG  EDIT- Positions 139 shares at 39  DISCLAIMER: I'm NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. BUY GME AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Robinhood is actually the sheriff
ROBINHOOD RESTRICTIONS
Problems with webull signup and I‚Äôm unable to buy $GME, $BB, $BBBY and a few other stocks. What‚Äôs next brothers? MUX? Help Retards
WHY are Brokers Halting Stocks?!
Like i‚Äôm genuinely curious, why are brokers from Robinhood to MerrillLynch halting GME and AMC?  - What are they gaining? - Are they trying to circumvent something? - Or are they not fuckingn with the STONNKS
Buying and holding. Was able to buy another 100 BB on the major dip üòÄ   . Buying on the dip is called buying at a discount guys! ROOTING FOR MY GME BROTHERS! GME was too much for me but I‚Äôm rooting for you guys!
HOLD DONT SELL DONT GIVE UP
THEY CANT HOLD US BACK FOREVER HOLD DONT U FUCKIN SELL U UNDERSTAND ME
Pressure creates the
Not looking great.
I think the market manipulation is having a detrimental effect
They want us die! We need to be United!!!
Since Robinhood is dead. For new comers who just join us. We need to guide them to the new platform. I know cash app is still working. Anything else???
Open account and trade today?
I am new to this and obviously behind, but I want to join in on the action! I opened an E trade account but it will take a few days to verify my bank deposit before I can trade. Are there any other sites I can use that will allow me to open an account and trade today?
PLTR still available on Robinhood. Buy? Avoid?
Charles Schwab doubled my order and I‚Äôm 15k over leveraged
They were blocking purchase of GME and it kept giving me errors about my order. I kept hitting place order after refreshing and then it processed 88 shares of GME when I didn‚Äôt even have enough to cover that. Of course it bought in at highest and wasn‚Äôt allowing me when it was low.  I‚Äôm on hold with schwab but nervous that I may have to cover the position if this goes downhill.
Can‚Äôt buy but at least I can exercise! Would have sold this to buy more GME but I guess I‚Äôll just hold instead!   ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Would seem that they have taken back the control.
PSA $AMC Available on Cash App
What comes after GME?
STIC. Yeah, the company merging with BarkBox. The same company you retards chased up to $20. Guess what, it‚Äôs now at $13, the same price it opened   you wanted it at $20, NOW IS THE TIME TO GET IT. When u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT posted the DD on STIC, he was way too early. SEC filings will be starting soon for merger in Q2. BUY LOW AND SELL HIGH    .

Move all your money out from Robinhood to   WEBULL   OR   CASHAPP! Don't sell right now! BUT NEVER PUT NEW MONEY IN AND WHEN THINGS CHILL OUT, MOVE YOUR MONEY!!! After we fuck Melvin, we will fuck Robinhood!!!      FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS HERE:      to file a complaint with the SEC.    to file a complaint wit with FINRA.    to file a complaint with Robinhood directly.  USE THIS ADDRESS:  Robinhood Financial LLC  85 Willow Road Menlo Park,  CA 94025 United States  TEXT:  This  morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from  purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without  notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock  down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing.  Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares  being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.  We  retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a  LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect"  us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory  authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other  actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the  number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is  market manipulation.  CREDITS TO:

It now seems that Robinhood does not give you an option to SELL or BUY.
IT IS GOING UP AGAIN!!! BUY GME!!! LOOK FOR OTHER PLATFORMS BUY AND HOLD GME
Dont be tricked by this dip just buy!!!

WE ARE SAVING AMC, KEEP HOLDING
Position: 35 AMC @
I (Hedge Fund) shorts stock at night. Go to my friend next day Robinhood and tell that DONT allow anyone to buy. They can only sell. Market goes down because of artificial selling pressure. Stocks goes down. Hedge fund wins. Yes. Nothing is ILLEGAL here. Move on.
Wanted you guys to know that I'm still with you.... Canadians can still buy. Just doubled down
Threw in the rest of my money. 2 more shares @ 310. Gonna keep holding guys, we are with you. Fuck robinhood and if you have another brokerage available go on there and buy more!

Serious question, do you guys have any idea how long this trade suspension will last on Robinhood?      I have calls expiring Friday and this looks pretty bad...

$BB is getting raped... we need halp too
Pls halp
GME, AMC, NOK, BB - brothers and sisters, this fight is not over. Not even close.
Brothers and sisters. If this is your first time investing anything seriously, welcome. This do be how it be (sometimes).   You thought that move to $500 was the top? Not even close. If you look at the market value of the outstanding shorts, it‚Äôs not a meme, this stock could go to $1,000 easily. Same to be said with our hurting brothers and sisters in AMC, NOK, and BB.   Please remember, no matter how bad it   NOT SELL. Selling makes you and the rest of us lose more money. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE.  Keep buying, do not back down.
MODS: Please let this pass through. Some Short Holdings and Long Holdings of MC and Most Likely Many Others
They‚Äôre trying to staunch the bleed on GME, and you‚Äôre probably diamonds handing with your cock in your hand while they figure out how much this is going to cost since they are trapped. For those whom have already paperhanded and for those on the sidelines that couldn‚Äôt get in:   Hit all their holdings. Hold GME. If you can‚Äôt buy more, hit their shorts they haven‚Äôt covered. The gate is down. Calls and shares were their grip is slipping again. All of their calls and shares are vulnerable to shorting. Melvin is just the canary, and everyone has been copying them. Here‚Äôs what I was following:    They are literally manipulating the market and blaming you for it. You, the autist the needs a fisher price app to trade, and lines their pockets with theta, tax dollars, and 401k fees. They should‚Äôve hit up the casino for how to risk manage and rig the game more transparently.    Not financial advice, because this is just an open forum and CNBC CAN CATCH THESE HANDS!
Threw what little I had at AMC because movies fuckin rule and I‚Äôm holding this until it reaches Proxima Centauri, Robinhood and Big F nance suck my cock to the balls
IT'S DIPPING! BUY BUY BUY!!!
Gme down to sub 300. buy the dip.
Stash App Blocking GME as well. This is beyond ridiculous.
NAKD, GME,   that shit.
Do it for your parents and their parents.
$AMC buy
Right now is the best time to grab the amc and bb. Who else is guying?
GameStop-Heavy ETF Shrinks Sharply Amid Redemptions --
The GameStop(GME)-heavy  SPDR S&P Retail ETF shrunk considerably in size Wednesday as authorized  market makers redeemed about 70% of the shares outstanding of the  exchange-traded fund. The shares outstanding stood at around   million at the close of trading  Wednesday, down from   million on Tuesday. The fund size stood at about  $237 million, according to State Street Global  Advisors, which oversees the ETF . The market makers delivered more than   million shares of the ETF to  State Street Global Advisors and received the shares of the 95  companies in the ETF including GameStop(GME) , which represented   of the ETF  at the close of trading Wednesday. ETF shares can be redeemed or created at the  request of market makers. It's not clear why there was such a big redemption of the fund on  Wednesday. The XRT ETF was up nearly 2%, to $ , in early trading  Thursday after rising 12% Wednesday as GameStop(GME) surged 134%. GameStop(GME) was up about 9%, to  $379, in volatile early trading Thursday. The ETF is up 43% this  year with GameStop(GME)  accounting for about 64% of the advance. GameStop's (GME)    weighting in the ETF is up from about   at the start of 2021, thanks to the  surge in GameStop's(GME)  share price from around $18 on Dec. 31. But its weighting in the ETF is due to fall sharply in mid-March, when the  fund undergoes its quarterly rebalancing. The ETF is equal weighted, meaning that the 95 components are rebalanced  quarterly to each have a roughly 1% weighting. The fund's objective is to  provide broad exposure to the retailing sector. The quarterly rebalancing occurs on March 19 -- the third  Friday of the final month of the quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones  Indices. That means that GameStop(GME) could be a major driver of the ETF  for weeks to come. When the rebalancing occurs, the ETF would sell enough GameStop(GME) stock to bring its  weighting down to 1%. The next largest components of the ETF after GameStop(GME) are Blink Charging(BLNK) and Magnite(MGNI) at around   Write to Andrew Bary at     (END) Dow Jones Newswires   01-28-211044ET   Copyright (c) 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
How do I buy GME if it‚Äôs no longer on Robinhood or cashapp
I‚Äôve never played the stock market before. I want in on sticking it to the Hedge Funds.
These bloody Hedge Funds need to pay for what they‚Äôve done to our country. To this day, millions of families are still reeling from the effects of the Recession, and nobody has ever been held accountable for it.   I was just eight during the Recession. At the time I was young enough that I didn‚Äôt notice too much had changed. Now, with almost fifteen years of maturity and hindsight, I can confidently look back and see just how much they messed us over.  I‚Äôve never played the stock market before. I‚Äôm just a college student, but I‚Äôve got savings built up that I can risk some of it. As many of you have said here before: it‚Äôs not about the money; it‚Äôs about sending a message. I plan on joining the party today, buying a share or two of GameStop.
Do not fucking sell
No matter how much GME dips do not fucking sell. Do not deflate the price more for these corrupt motherfuckers. Hold, and whenever you can BUY.

My dad just gave up the boomer lifestyle
Tldr. I've been on wsb lurking for a little while and took a pretty decent amount gains from you guys. My dad always went rhe traditional route and with all you guys making news on GME he texted me and said he wants to put 10k on GME because "you and your reddit buddies are making those hedge fund bitches cry like babies"   Godbless you all. Autism is genetics.  Updates. Idk if yolo was the appropriate flair or if this allowed. If not lmk.
Robinhood must be made to pay for this
And the best way to do it is to spread the word and leave their platform completely. They sold out and sold us out.   They cost people like us so much money this morning with this little stunt.
GME RISING BUY BUY BUY AND HOLD HOLD
ITs GOING UP BABY
Webull has just suspended buying GME.
Now isn't the time to give up
Keep strong everyone and hold on. GME!!!!
Can‚Äôt afford $GME.
Should I go in on AMC or wait??
Not as easy as Robinhood, but you can buy and sell AMC, GME and NOK on etrade
I already had an etrade account so I did it there. Don't like the fee, but like that it's possible.
What should I use now that Robinhoods over
Robinhood is crook. They try to cover the ass of citadel and other big hedge because they get 40% of rev from them according to this article. This needs to be reported to SEC
Transferred money into FREETRADE, not showing up? ¬£250 into thin air?

A Solemn Prayer For $GME

As we forgive those who sold shares before us, and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from market manipulation.  Amen.
Report all GME and AMC doomers. We mooning. We holding. We are giving the market manipulators a deep dicking.
Oh yes. All the shorters got caught with their pants around their ankles. Now they‚Äôre STUCK inside their mistresses.   Do NOT let up! Squeeeeeeze  The real party has not even started yet. Watch them start covering.  AMC. GME. ‚ÄúShares not calls. I‚Äôm off to fondle my girlfriend‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs balls.‚Äù
Robinhood is allowed to ban trades.
Deep within the fine print of robinhoods rules and regulations, you agreed to allow them to restrict certain trades at any time. Scummy but legal.
I was able to buy GME on Fidelity this morning. Move over there now and abandon Robinhood forever
I bought this morning on Fidelity but now Robinhood is pushing the price down along with others. Don't let them get away with it. Take your business elsewhere
Citadel owns Melvin... Citadel also owns... Robinhood?? Did we all know this?
Wtf?? This is such clear manipulation based on that info I just learned.
Time to transfer to a real brokerage
RIP Robinhood. You suck.
Hold the line. Hold the line.
Hold the line guys.
DO NOT SELL!!!
If you sell you lose simple as, remember that.  If they have to cheat, that means they‚Äôre desperate.
A glimpse into the future. After we stick it to the suits Gamestop will go down in history
We are mid-February, the squeeze squoze, we all cashed out at 5,000 tendies per share. Gamestop released 1 million shares in the process (a drop in the ocean) banking in $5B, they are debt free with $  on hand.  After the sell off Gamestop dropped in the $50-100 range but unlike those boomers we see the value in $GME, we buy back for the long haul, the shares settle in the low $100s ( $CHWY).¬†Their best selling apparel is the Roaring Kitty t-shirt.  We¬†already made history but we didn't stop there, the mods are holding us accountable and we all give a percentage of our gain porn to charities. Gamestop does the same and gives $100M to the Barstool Fund to help those that the¬†SEC, Wall Street crooks, dishonest journalist puppets, and other malfunctioning brain greedy fucks tried to¬†illegally¬†bankrupt. We changed the lives of thousands families, friends, small business owners, and Gamestop won generations of life long brand loyalty.  It's 2023, we're cruising, lord Ryan Cohen is doing his magic, let's check back in 2 years.  It‚Äôs 2025, Gamestop successfully transitioned to digital by taking a significant portion of a now $300B gaming market. We‚Äôre smooth sailing at $2000 a share, looks like we just got ourselves another 100-bagger, life is good.    and see you on the other side     Position: diamond handing    doggystyle  Disclaimer: ¬†Do your own DD, I like the stock.  TLDR: Melvin is handing us tendies at Wendy‚Äôs drive-thru while we‚Äôre on our way to DFV‚Äôs party mansion.

Now that you have proven yourselves, the rest of us feeble mortals are wondering ‚Äî  what‚Äôs next?  I‚Äôd love to get rich sticking it to the hedge fund guys and helping the economy.
I can buy shares of GME on thinkorswim FYI
With Robinhood blocked, are the hedge funds pushing the price down so they hit the stoplosses?
Is it possible that with buying blocked, the hedge funds are now trying to surround us and push the price down so they hit the stoplosses most people probably placed?  Can we win this without our comrades in the US?

Is anyone on here a lawyer and if so can we set up a class action lawsuit against Robinhood? It can‚Äôt be legal to just restrict buying but not selling. They are manufacturing advantage before our eves.
Are there any apps that you can sign up for without having to wait a few days for your application to be accepted?
I tried Webull, but It said it would take 1 to 3 days for them to accept my application. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

Just continue to hold and buy the dips. Nothing has changed. Their manipulation is proof they are hurt and desperate. This is their death rattle. Just keep HOLDING. Buy dips if you can, but above all, just hold
I have officially put in motion to start a class action lawsuit against Robinhood are there obviously criminal acts of Market manipulation and keeping us from buying additional stocks today and tomorrow.
You should join me in the fight. What they did midday yesterday going into today is absolutely Criminal. As many of you already know, they have made it impossible for us to buy new stocks and only be able to close out the old ones only in an attempt to save their Rich fat cat Wall Street Buddies. I hope more people file a motion to bring up a class action lawsuit against this evil company.

Don‚Äôt fall for their dirty tricks. They are trying to scare you into clicking that sell button to drive down the price. These are the same institutions who are connected one way or the other.
Hold. If you sell they win. This is what they want. They are trying to scare you into selling to flood the market and drive the share price down. They can win today and tomorrow and the next but eventually we will win if we hold. They will have to cover for the options expiring Friday.  Robinhood is backed by Citadel. Citadel gave $2 billion to Melvin.  Notice anything??
Any room on here for a meme?

REVOLUT IS WORKING FOR ME AGAIN. BUY BUY BUY
Thank you, from one person who can't take part in what you're doing.
Hi all. Back in '08, When everything was "normal", back when I was working as a retail slave, the entire world came crashing down around us. I was laid off from my retail slave job and had to move in with my parents. I didn't know what to do, so I decided to go back to school and study Finance and work on my degree while I was waiting for jobs to improve. I paid for the first two semesters from my savings and from grants I applied for. After a year, I still didn't have a job and I had eaten through my savings, so I started applying for fed loans to cover my classes.  I graduated and wouldn't you know, finance companies were looking for entry-level people with 5-7 years of experience. The ones who were hiring were skeevy cold-caller companies trying to sell questionable financial instruments to the elderly for near minimum wage. Out of an immediate need for cash, I re-read all my accounting textbooks and applied for a job with a small company as a bookkeeper. I got the job and I've been doing ok for me and my family since.   Now everything is once again fucked. I lost half my salary as our customers died out. I've eaten through my savings once again, and I have a choice between waiting for the market to recover and get my salary back, or I can start looking for a job somewhere else for a starting salary of about 60% of what I was making before.   I want to buy into GME to support, but I have $5 in my bank, I'm four months behind on my rent, and I'm selling plasma and going to food banks to support my wife and daughter. Even with all that, you guys are giving me hope for the future, or at least a sense of enjoyment as I'm watching the big guys who spent decades trickling their piss down on everyone else get urinated on for a change. More than anything, I'm infuriated watching the federal government, banks, and market regulatory bodies   SCRAMBLE   to protect hedge funds   within a week  , while they let all my customers burn out and let the rest of us grin and bare it as they offer a $600 booby prize to the rest of us.  You guys have helped show me who the important people are, and how quickly and effectively the government COULD BE working to help the rest of us, but they choose not to.   I don't know if they're going to make the kind of coordinated retail counter-buying fuckery that you guys are pulling off illegal, but if I'm not homeless by the time you all pick another target, I will do everything I can to buy in.   Thank you all.

Buy NOK fellow retards!!
I'm placing my sell orders at $1000 AMC
It seems like I can no longer buy any stocks since my broker had limited my trading permission  Maybe is because I hold 5100 shares of AMC?  So if they think they can pressure me to sell at a crappy price, I'm gonna place all my sell orders at a ridiculous price as $1000, now how about THAT?!  If you want it so bad? You gotta spend $1000s for it you billionaire bastards!!!!
Robinhood Financial Class Action

Just had a talk with their customer service people. Apparently, it's an "upper management" decision. This screams like a liquidity play for tomorrow's potential option expiration mess.
50% up and downs are just the volatility, do not panic and buy that dip who you can: GME
Today‚Äôs Paper
Robinhood on their recent hides
WSB founder on Yahoo!Finance

Do not let go fellas!! Even if the bitches at RobinHood have banned the stock keep buying on other platforms! Hold the line!!! To the moon
HOLD EVERY SINGLE STOCK RH IS SUSPENDING!!!!!!
Don‚Äôt let the fuckers win.
Robinhood logged me out of their app. I tried logging back in and it won‚Äôt let me. Meanwhile I‚Äôm getting emails informing me that my limit orders are being cancelled.
Anyone else experiencing this?
WE GOT EM SCARED AND THEY KNOW WE KNOW , DONT LET UP . PRESS ON INTO GLORY.
Someone posted a pic of these fucks laughing off the exchange balcony in 2007 during occupy. LAUGHING AND TAKING PICTURES , GUESS WHAT? We got em fucking crying now , we got them fucking scrambling to do anything they can to minimize the billions they‚Äôre losing and somehow fuck us over like always . FUCK THAT , BUY ON WHATEVER YOU CAN BUY ON AND DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT SELLING UNTIL WERE GETTING NEAR 4-5 DIGITS.
Dear panic seller
Your mom is a ho  Seriously,  cut the shit
I‚Äôm down a little over 40k on $AMC.
I don‚Äôt fucking care. It‚Äôs about the message‚Äî these hedge funds manipulate stocks for a living, and when they taste the pain they create for decades‚Äî suddenly it‚Äôs a problem? They fought against regulation to the death‚Äî the death of US. They caused recessions. Killed businesses. Got bailed out, over and over. Now, I fight back to say ‚Äúfuck you.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small message, but it‚Äôs   my   message. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got. I hope they get regulated to shit because of this, and it‚Äôs all exposed in the open. This is a class war‚Äî all the investment platforms halting buys and allowing sales? It‚Äôs bullshit. They want you to lose. Well, then fine. I‚Äôll die on this hill. If my 401k goes with it, then I‚Äôll fucking work for a living.   Fuck them. They don‚Äôt get my dignity.
GME Float moving our way -   and counting. Up from 120% this morning!
Tide is turning boys! Stay strong! Holdddd!
DO NOT SELL GME, BUY THE DIP!
Robinhood and TD restricting trades gives short sellers enough time to recover their losses then it'll be back up
Pretty terrible move by these brokers, clear sign whom they're working for. Do all you can to get the word out.
NAKD Going Up
Time to fuck with some short   the NAKD train (pants optional)
What do we project for AMC?
Are we thinking it‚Äôll peak at $20? $100? What are we thinking?
To those of you with balls softer than steel
At this point all my money is in RH. Retarded, I know. I can‚Äôt get funds cleared fast enough to buy GME with any other broker. So what‚Äôs a retard like me supposed to do? The next best thing - SPCE Here are the main points of my DD: 1. Short interest is at 81% 2. Chamath Palihapitia is a chairman of SPCE 3. SPCE will be included in Cathy Woods‚Äô ARTX next month 4. Test flight scheduled for this month 5.                                   Information above deemed reliable but not guaranteed  Positions: SPCE $40c 3/19
THIS IS BEYOND ABOUT MONEY. THIS IS WAR. #hedgetrimmers
I‚Äôm down $7k but I believe $AMC $GME ‚úä
This is their attack on us, many people have already blown up the SEC with market manipulation complaints, keep going. What they‚Äôre doing is illegal and will be dealt with as such. Don‚Äôt let them scare you, they‚Äôre betting on us losing hope, diamond hands brings the tendies.
Stop selling. You are letting them win everything back. STOP SELLING!
Is Robinhood displaying a lower stock price to encourage retail investors to sell?
The ‚ÄúBig Boys ‚Äú are butt hurt
PSA: Robinhood is owned by Citadel, a hedge fund that has big investment in Melvin Capital
Blocking buying GME is clear market manipulation and the hedge fund should be fined to hell and taken away their trading licence.
Ignore the fake news! Buy if you can and hold if you can‚Äôt buy!
Idc what these fake news organizations are saying, no one is moving to other stocks! There has never been a better opportunity to make money! The fat cats are pulling out all the stops and employing every market manipulation tactic they know and making up new ones in the process. I‚Äôm in a private investing group with my friends and ALL of them are buying the dips and they weren‚Äôt yesterday! We aren‚Äôt rich but this isn‚Äôt our life savings, it‚Äôs our play money. People from around the world are starting to buy and hold that don‚Äôt have restrictions from their brokerages. The blowback for Robinhood, CNBC, and any other org limiting buying and employing manipulation tactics is going to be epic! Hold hold hold!
From Robinhood to...?
Who can we move to that‚Äôs a competitor to Robinhood?
WE KNOW WHAT JA RULE THINKS OF THIS BEARISH GARBAGE!! GME, AMC, BB, NOK, EXPR! All to the moon!!
OFFICIALLY NOT SELLING
Listen this is something that isn‚Äôt gonna be ignored they‚Äôre showing on full display just how much control over the market these people actually have. What they are doing is ILLEGAL and many of us will not accept that we can fight this and we need to it‚Äôs bigger than Tendie town this is frankly a war for American financial freedom trading will never be the same after this
Hold tf on
THEY WOULDNT BE MANIPULATING THIS HARD IF THEY WEREN‚ÄôT SCARED
FUCK THEM TO THE MOON  FUCK THEM TO MARS  FUCK THEM TO PLUTO   FUCK THEM TO THE GAMMA QUADRANT

DONT PUSSY OUT NOW. KEEP HOLDING. MELVIN CAN EAT MY ASS IN HELL!!!!!!!!!
Keep holding
LETS GO RETARDS!
How do I get in on this when every app is refusing to trade GME and others?

They ban our stocks. They spread lies about us. They manipulate our markets down. But we are stronger. Buy and hold AMC and GME.
THERE ARE BOTS ON THIS FORUM TELLING YOU ITS DONE. ITS NOT. FUCKING HOLD ON TO YOUR SHARES OF GME

Bought AT the meme level and STILL holding, get back in and HOLD
I managed to buy a bit more GME through the german name of the stock on TTwoOneTo. German code is GC2S if Im correct. Also Added BB. GME and BB are dipping (probably because of market manipulation by hedgeboys and their buddies) but that just means more opportunities to buy the dip!
The climb on gme bb nok sndl has begun. Get in quick
$KOSS - new bag holder. Wife is gonna kill me.
I have it on good word Schwab is letting buys happen
FELLOW AUTISTS DONT LET THEM TAKE AMC FROM US!!! THEY CANT HANDLE GME SO THEY WANT TO PICK OFF AMC FIRST THEN COME FOR GME! BUY THE DIP AND HOOOOOOLD!
I am new to the stock market and was wondering if someone could teach me the ropes to how it all works (I just want to know, I don't have money to actually invest)
CLASS ACTION
Companies restricting the trading of securities seems very illegal to me.  I do not know the law, but if they are breaking it there is a chance anyone invested or who tried to invest in $GME and others could become plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against these firms. Anyone with knowledge out there know if I‚Äôm being retarded or not to think this? This could be our next avenue to fight the man where it hurts.
Call your Congressmen and woman about market manipulation. Fight back!!!
Greetings fellow autists.   What we are witnessing at the current moment is the sheer determination of the elites to fight back against us retail investors. Don't be fooled, this is class warfare. Robinhood, which sells its order flow to Citadel, which is a parent company to Melvin, is preventing retail investors from bleeding the fat cats. TDA is doing a very similar thing as are other brokers.  We all need to call our Congressmen and woman and let our voice be heard. 4 million autists have a lot of power. The USA is founded on the principles of free market capitalism and this ladies and gentlemen, would make the founding fathers roll over in their graves. We must unite and fight back. I urge you to let your representatives know that this will not be tolerated and tell them that you demand an investigation take place. We want free markets for all not rigged markets that favor the elites!!!!
She‚Äôs rising again let‚Äôs go they can‚Äôt stop the free market forever
Revolut has also stopped accepting buy orders for GME stock.
RIGGED SYSTEM
Robinhood trades through Citadel.   Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital - the largest hedge fund to short GME/AMC.   THEY HAVE DIRECT INTEREST IN DRIVING DOWN THE PRICE FOR SHORTS.
HOLD THE MOTHERFUCKING LINE
MAKE THE RICH BLEED MONEY
I can't withdraw funds from robinhood
How do I withdraw some of my gains on robinhood? I'm switching APPS ASAP

Op squeeze Kr
KR has s 2b short on its head. We have to control the narrative against this war with hedge funds. They have put out hit pieces on this sub.

THIS IS A TEST OF OUR STRENGTH, IF YOU GIVE IN NOW YOU'RE GIVING IN TO THE BIGGER MAN
WE ARE THE REVOLUTION, WE WANTED TO SEND A MESSAGE SO LETS SEND IT, WE HOLD THE LINE STRONG AND KEEP PLUGGING ALONG.
What‚Äôs a good trading app, not Robinhood, eTrade, Fedelity
AMC?
Seriously, should I hold AMC? I bought in at $  and it's not looking good right now, especially considering the limits on trading by Robinhood
It‚Äôs important that this movement doesn‚Äôt die like occupy Wall Street. If the past is an indicator, governments will infiltrate and disrupt this action. Please take steps to prevent this. Thank you.
Dear RobinHood, I‚Äôm glad you could take money from a teenager trying to pay for his college and give it to someone like Melvin Capital who needs the money to buy more sports cars or houses!
Where do I sign up for the class action suit?
Robinhood may not get away with fucking the people like this.   Where do I sign up?
Attention all WSB Apes.
We are getting off track.   Everyone is pissed right now, I am too but we need to focus on the squeeze. This ride isnt over, and the bears are still shitting themselves despite everything they've done to try to keep us down.   We can still hold the shorts out, we have the power.  I'm holding. I wont sell. Not till we reach andromeda. Encourage everyone you can to buy and everyone must hold.   Holding will win us what they've tried to keep from us.   Apes together = Strong.
Simmer Down Now. Don‚Äôt panic and hold the line. AMC, BB, GME, NOK
1) If you aren‚Äôt comfortable losing money, this probably ain‚Äôt the best place for you.  2) Hedge and shorts may win only because they are more coordinated than a bunch of retards on Reddit... this HOLD or BUY what you are willing to lose.  3) Ignore the price changes right now. Put in a buy on one of the big four here: AMC, BB, GME, NOK and take a walk.  4) We can make a big impact, but we have to be smarter than the guys running the hedge... that means taking a chill and working as a team.   Relax, then HOLD or BUY the dip.
ZOM
Zom's at under a dollar a share and still acessible on Robinhood! Sounds like a good chance!
I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
GME TRADING ON SUPER LOW VOLUME! THIS IS NO REAL DROP DONT GET FOOLED!
ONLY 21 Mio. traded so far. This is not the end!
If Robinhood wants to manipulate the free market, its time to show them the consequences of a free market
There are so many other brokerages out there folks. I know this forum is buzzing right now, everyone's talking Robinhood and manipulation so I appreciate you taking a second to read this.   We as retail investors have our right to exercise choice in the free market and to do business with the best brokers. The past twenty four hours have made it exceedingly clear that Robinhood is not beyond manipulation of the free market to save a few wealthy assholes' tendies.  It is time to make them pay the price for that choice. Transfer shares to other brokerages. Transfer cash to other brokerages. File complaints, both with FINRA and the SEC. File complaints with state regulators. Get involved and make noise cause this is some fucking bullshit.
Everyone is Noticing
Market manipulation
Is it manipion if my friends and family send me money to buy stonks?
NAKD
Hang out with your wang out, let‚Äôs get $NAKD
IF U HAVE CASH AND WANT TO BUY USE ETORO, GME BUY WORKS THERE
jsut bought @ 280
Is this a dip or am I retarded? GME
Hold your stocks and buy $AMC $BB $NOK
They‚Äôre manipulating prices.. and if everyone sold these things would be at 0. So people are holding and funds are shorting more shares because they think they created a situation here. Little do they know we hold and buy and the squeeze is gonna be one for the books. Your kids kids will talk about it
Market manipulation in chart form
Today is a great day
I feel terrible for you guys who are denied the right to buy what ever the fuck you want at whatever fucking price you want to pay, but today is the fucking boxing day for tendie lovers. This is great news, I didn't think I was going to ever be able to pick all these stocks for so cheap.  I love tendies so I just bought GME and I'm buying more BB.  I love dips, I like to dip my tendies in them.  Lets fucking go!
BUY NOW WHILE IT'S AT IT'S LOWEST. REBOUND I COMING
Any app I can buy GME on right now without having to wait days to get verified?
FUCK Robinhood   I yield my time
HOOOOOLLLLDDDDD IIIIITTTTTTT
Imagine if it got removed, that would be the ULTIMATE fuck you'
From a normie who doesn't know shit about   fucking done!
Seriously, well done.  I do not delve into this kind of thing at all.  But you are making corporate bastards hurt, and I love it.  Keep up the fight!
I found out CashApp has an investing feature but it looks like some major stocks are missing?
Hold the line retards! Calm yourself and ride the wave. On the other side is tendies!!! Buy the dip!
GME - Be brave lads. Who else is not selling?
Withdrawal all your money from Robinhood for supporting market manipulation! These guys have ALWAYS been crooked. File complaints with the SEC
People don't remember the outages during the covid crash? Well that was intentional
No apps are working for me
Cashapp still has a $21 buy for Nokia it has been ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù for two hours. It won‚Äôt let me make a new one either, OR cancel my current one.  I can‚Äôt find any other apps that work; what‚Äôs the best way to invest here? I‚Äôm not putting my life savings in this but I really want to be able to treat my family with any profits I make. It‚Äôs my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday soon and there‚Äôs little money in Mississippi. This is disheartening and I‚Äôve stayed up all night to try to capitalize on this as best I can.  Any help would be appreciated!
KEEP HOLDING WITH YOUR BAD DIAMOND HANDS YOU                                                DO NOT SELL
We're fucked bois. Place an order on Amazon for a dilator and cope with me
The market is VERYYYY clearly locked to only allow hedges and big players right now  thats the only way to explain the massive percentage drops and  increases. Look at any chart for confirmation. If WE can't buy who do you think is. They're covering their own losses and we come out the losers. The market is only open to hedges right now. They'll reopen  tomorrow when they've all successfully exited and leave the individual  investor with the inability to make any money and actually leave market  at a mass loss.
We‚Äôre seeing history right now...... but I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt participate.
I love the stock market and this has to be the most major stock event I‚Äôve seen since 2020 stock market crash. I wish I could buy stock and I‚Äôve been following since the beginning. But Fuck the Hedge and HOLD   .

You‚Äôre truly a proud father.  17 years later, she reads about the Great GME Squeeze.  ‚ÄúHey Dad, do you remember this?‚Äù she asks.  ‚ÄúWhy yes, my sweet butterscotch, I do. In fact, your old man was apart of it!‚Äù you quickly reply.  ‚ÄúTell me, did you hold the line for your fellow comrades? Or did you sell when the markets closed, effectively making you a puppet of the TOP  ‚Äù  I‚Äôll leave it up to you to think about what you would say.   Is that how you want your daughter Emily to look up to you? Your life will never be the same. Your wife will probably leave you too.  HOLD the line. Don‚Äôt do it for me, do it for Emily.

TDA is still allowing trades on AMC GME BB etc.
For all those still looking to buy but are being blocked by robinhood, I can confirm as of 10:56am est TD Ameritrade is still allowing trades as usual. Mobile app seems to be having issues but the website still works.

M1 Finance, Dough, & Moomoo are still allowing people to buy GME, BB, & AMC on their platform!
UPVOTE SO OTHERS CAN SEE    There are still some   based commission free brokerages that are allowing people to buy GME, BB, & AMC on their platforms. They are also currently responding to any issue with their service on Twitter directly. If anyone needs to make the switch form Robinhood or Webull, then these are still viable options.
EU degens, Degiro have now stopped us buying GME
Raise Silver's price to cripple the entire financial system, details below.
For decades, bulge bracket banks have relied heavily on silver price manipulation for their bottom line. More specifically, most bulge bracket banks, like JPM, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, have significant short positions on Silver to keep the price artificially low and put a veil over the inflation of our economy. The revolution is coming, our real inflation is being hidden, and kinder has been placed and is only waiting for a spark to burn this fucker to the ground.   The similarities between the bulge bracket banks' greed with silver and the manipulation of the housing market in 2008 are striking. Simply put, pumping the silver stock would be a devastating blow to these motherfuckers that think they can control us by shutting down our platforms.      Pump silver, win the game.
Screenshots of AMC, NOK, GME, NKD, BB, BBBY blocked from Robinhood search. This is market manipulation and they need to be investigated by the SEC

As it says, switching from Robinhood. Down to Webull or Fidelity as my choices. Suggestions or comments?
THIS IS THE DIP WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR
BUY BUY BUY. Worldwide just buy and hold the line.   To infinity and beyond.
Knowing Robinhood doesnt care for its userbase, what other brokerages should we use?
heard from my brother acorns might be good but hes not really well versed in any of this. what do we switch to?
Hear me out, let's try to get Biden involved
If we flood the presidential twitters with complaints about the blatant manipulation taking place right now, then we might bring enough attention to the issue for Robinhood to back out of their decision. Who knows how exactly Biden would react to the situation, but this seems like a way to give him a pretty good PR win for upholding free trade in the market for retail investors.
NOT A SINGE WORD FROM CNBC ABOUT ROBINHOOD MANIPULATING GME. FUCK CNBC! FUCK ROBINHOOD!
Buy GE!!!!
They manufacture everything and it hasn‚Äôt been taken down by Robinhood yet
TD AMERITRADE HAS RESTRICTED GME TRADING!

People who sell have small dick energy

What is the worst thing we can legally do to Robinhood for this blatant manipulation of the market?
IF YOU SELL, THEY WIN. DIAMOND HANDS
Already lost thousands of dollars but I don't give a shit. A message needs to be sent and I didn't live through 2008 just to get here and watch these corrupt tumors of society get away with this shit again. Fucking HOLD   Not giving financial advice, just venting.
"we fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets" that's why we are limiting 15 stocks to sell only..
BB BlackBerry aka Big Baller
Just went in on more BB since there is a dip right now.  Snap up those sales!  (I like this stock)
quit robinhood

Calm down and hold üòå   üèª
Dips are not new to us. Panic helps nothing. Short sellers still need to buy in. Keep your eyes on the prize :) stay calm brothers. To the moon
Permanently Closing Robinhood Account
Robinhood‚Äôs actions today are inexcusable, especially for a platform claiming to be democratizing finance. What a sham. I am withdrawing my funds and permanently closing my Robinhood account. I hope others do the same and their user losses far outpace their interest in screwing their most loyal customers all over today.   Will reinvest in GME, AMC, etc. once I have a new account set up with an honest brokerage. I LIKE THE STOCK!
Anyone ever seen the old cartoon Animal Farm? Pigs stay rich and in charge while the other farm animals get screwed.
For the youngins out there.. its worth spending 1hr to watch this.  >Life for all the animals (except the pigs) is harsh. Eventually, the pigs begin walking on their hind legs and take on many other qualities of their former human oppressors. The Seven Commandments are reduced to a single law: "  All Animals Are Equal / But Some Are More Equal Than Others.  "
I vote we all band together and Sue Robinhood for damages
I‚Äôm fucking tired of dealing with these fuck holes who control my money but could care less about the risk tolerance of some Melvin fuck head. I‚Äôm tired of these people who think their value is more than ours because they learned how to fuck each other in the back alley early on in life.  Vote Yay for a lawsuit   Vote nay for one percenter market manipulation
HOLD FOREVER BROTHERS!   üèª
I have to sign off, I haven't done School work this entire week... When I com back BB and GME will be in ANDROMEDA and we will all get diamond tattoos!
Where can I open an account to buy stock right now
Tried to make a Webull account but I have to wait 2-3 business days for them to confirm my account.
Desperate
Trying to scare us.  #SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE   Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but  may not trigger the short squeeze .   It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.   #DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.   It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is  guaranteed  mathematically is that the shorts  will have to cover  at  some  point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the   false expectation   of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair.   DON'T BE THAT PERSON.     #WE LIKE THE STOCK   #KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK   #Limit order set to $5,000+  üèª  .„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ ‚ú¶ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ „ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄÀö„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ ‚ú¶ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ,„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ„ÄÄ   .„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄÔæü„ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚òÄÔ∏è„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.   ,„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ   „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà ‚ú¶ „ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ,„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ,„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç „ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Ää‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄÀö„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ,„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ ‚ú¶ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ. „ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ   „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ „ÄÄ   Àö„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄÔæü„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ üåé ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç ,„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\  .„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ ‚ú¶ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇ „ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄÀö„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ\ „ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚Äà ‚Äà„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ.

Where to buy GME
is there anywhere to buy more GME?  Im not leaving!
I don't know who needs to hear this but you can transfer shares from Robinhood through the ACATS system to another brokerage for a $75 fee. You can't transfer fractional shares and it takes around a week.

What's our robinhood workaround??
I've only used robinhood out of simplicity, but since theyve sided with the hedgenobs, what other options do I have to buy,buy,buy?
What app to use, now that RH is dead?

Robinhood: Your bank account account cannot be linked. Anyone got any suggestionsm
Hey guys, I decided to sign up for Robinhood because of everything going on(don't worry, it isbjust a curiosity rather than trying to lose my life savings on this by going all in so late in the game) and everything was going smoothly while I put my banking info in to link it until I got to the account number screen.   My account was confirmed, the balance listed was correct, but when I put my account number in Robinhood came back saying that my bank account wasn't compatible with being linked or something like that.   Does anyone know why that is? And do you have any suggestions for other brokerages that you guys like to use.   For the record, it is a credit union checking account that is over 10 years old.
why can't i buy what i like anymore?

GME price is not falling! It's fabricated and froced my market freezes
Not advice, just letting people know the truth. The gme price is not falling. No one is selling at these low prices. There's no sell wall. It's a freeze forces by them as they drive the price down themselves. As soon as it's unfrozen it will be gobled up to $500 like my grandma's tiramisu!
LET'S REMEMBER THE BROKERS WHO TRIED WHO FUCKED US OVER! HERE IS A LIST WITH ALL BROKERS WHO TRIED TO MANIPULATE THE MARKET. COMMENT NEW CASES IN THE COMMENTS PLS

BUY THE DIPS
Reckless Hedge Funds and Bankers ruined Lives
Ladies and gentlemen,   This irony in what we are dealing with during this battle is truly the definition of irony. The 2008 financial crisis was caused by RECKLESS Hedge Funds and Banks selling high risk and useless mortgages as bundled financial products. They knew they were worthless and what it would cause but they did it anyway. All while ruining countless lives in the meantime.   Now the year is 2021 and they want to call a group of degenerate idiots buying a few stocks that we fundamentally believe in (whether you agree or not) reckless. Nothing about this is reckless. We know the risks, no one is being forced, and no one is being deceived. We all know what we are buying and we all love these stocks whether for nostalgia or for actual company fundamentals. If you needed any more evidence that Wall Street is a bunch of crooks then here it is. The thought of the 2008 financial crisis makes me sick. Millions of people lost their homes, jobs, retirement, and their well deserved peace in their later years.   Brokerages like Robinhood, TD, and others are bought and paid for. They choose to get in bed with the wrong side of this battle. They are bought and paid for by the market makers, the broker-dealers, hedge funds like Citadel. I'm not sure when these stocks will come back to be bought on the brokerages, but we need to stand strong. This is about more than just the short squeeze. This is about the little guy. This is about us sitting on the sidelines while the big guys played around with our money and made billions. All while charging us fee's and giving none of it back. Stand strong warriors. This will not be an easy battle but there is strength in numbers. $GME $AMC $NOK to the fucking Moon!!!!
Can confirm that the Schwab app works for GME, AMC, BB, NOK. The website does not seem to work
STOP SELLING! THEY WIN IF WE SELL! HOLD!!!!!!!!

Withdrawing from Robinhood ASAP
Withdrawing my $200k from the app as soon as I liquidate next week. If they want $0 commissions, go Fidelity all the way. These guys are market manipulators by cutting off demand to these stocks. When Robinhood ever get the balls to start dictating market activity and market pricing? So much for democratizing access to financial markets.  People are going to lose a whole lot because you, especially retail college kids who invested in these stocks yesterday or earlier.   Naked puts and short the f    out of Robinhood when it IPOs. They don't deserve the name Robinhood.   $AMC, $GME, $BB, $NOK

Bullish on GME and BB
Gentlemen... battles just begun! HOLD YOUR GROUND
Stick it to the rich.
The outrage this is creating, by normal, everyday investors is insane. Once the millionaires are threatened, they immediately want to shut down the reason they‚Äôre losing cash. Robinhood already caved, but to all the brave soldiers, hold firm!
I'm sure I'm one of the few that operate on Vanguard, but they too have limited our actions today - AMC
The entire market has lost their minds. I'm happy Vanguard is allowing me to purchase to some degree today, but they are limiting upside on these stocks. Don't falter people. Don't sell, we will make it through this.
AMC IS EXTREMELY VOLATILE. HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. IT WILL GO UP
Robinhood is currently   star in the app store, Don't let up.

Fuck You Wall Street
Al l this "GME isnt worth its price it doenst follow fundementals" wah wah wah blah blah stfu. The Market doesn't give a shit what you think. Fuck You.
LISTEN UP SHITBAGS
If you lost a substantial amount of money due to robinhood manipulating the market, call your bank and put a stop payment on your funds and if they already posted then chargeback. If your bank denies you then state that you are in the process of filing a class action lawsuit against your broker and filing complaints to the SEC for market manipulation   Hit them where it hurts
Why should I hold until Friday?
What's happening Friday with GME? I understand that at  some  point they have to buy it again but that's as far as I'm informed.
Listen up RETARDS!! We are at the deep spike down before we shove it up Melvins ass. HOLD!!!
DIP caused by shorts
REPOST GUYS Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.  It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.  DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.  These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.  Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.  Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.  This is a repost!!!!!!
It‚Äôs my birthday today boys. Do me a favor and hold the line!

Why is that I bought calls and they are dropping in value even though the stock has done nothing but rise? The IV hasn‚Äôt moved hardly at all and my calls do nothing but drop with the rising share price. Thank you

Don‚Äôt let these fuckers win!!!
eToro is  accidentially  listing GME like this during freezes, no shame whatsoever
Robinhood is a SELLOUT app
I'm new to WSB but I've seen what ya'll do and it's fantastic.   Now I see the "financial experts" calling ya'll a public threat, social media trying to dismantle your social networks, and trying to take your purchasing power away.   They are strategizing to demonize you, to dismantle your communications platforms and to manipulate you with fear into believing selling is your only option.   You need to set up a branch right now. Use tiktok to communicate, twitter, set something up. Because they can take this page offline even for a few hours to panic people into selling.   Set up cashapps, or other investment alternatives. Bring lawsuits to robinhood for manipulation.      This isn't about money now. They are terrified of the power you all found and organized together. And if you are the target, you need to branch out and setup other media channels to survive what's coming.   I have 3k in AMC that I'm holding there forever. I'm never giving these bastards anything ever again.   Remember that Wall Street is OWNED and OPERATED BY Main Street. Fuck these clowns take their shit

Anyone remember Michael Scott Paper Company? That‚Äôs us!!! Right the hell now!!  Sure, we are on the ropes with every damn institution coming at us HARD, but they are fucking BLEEDING!!!! These funds are not going to stand for these losses week after week. HOLD THE DAMN LINE AND DO NOT SELL ANYTHING!!!
AMC DISCOUNT ü§ëü§ëü§ë
OH MY GOD DONT SELL YOU GUYS! WEAK ASS HANDS MF BUY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Punish Robinhood. No matter what happens today, on GME Robinhood!
I never used Robinhood, as I have a Schwab account for the past 13 years. I don't know what the lure of Robinhood is, but you guys HAVE to leave the company. NEVER use it again. They've shown you who owns them!
I'M Mexican, I don't know anything about this
I Bought BB and AMC, am in red numbers but HOLDING!!!!  VAMOS A LA LUNA     üéÜ
What the fuck is going on
But who the fuck is filing this class action lawsuit and when you do don‚Äôt forget to put this whole community in there. We can‚Äôt buy gme, price can‚Äôt go up. Simple.
The Declaration of the retail traders regarding Robinhood,
When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the financial bands which have connected them with another, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  1) Providing user data to Citadel, creating a direct conflict of interest  2) Arbitrarily halting the trading of certain securities to manipulate the market  3) Slow and laggy system causing users to miss-trade   4) Non existent customer service
RTON?
Any one know of rumblings about RTON or HCMC ? Are these worth looking into, as they look awfully cheap?
How fucking long are we going to let the rich treat us like this?
Channel your fucking anger retards  . Are we going to be back to pretending stuff like this doesn't happen a month from now? Don't just leave a 1-star review of Robinshit (do that though), then forget about it. When the dust settles (STILL HOLDING), take your money out and move it to a brokerage that didn't side with the rich and powerful today.   Beyond that, never forget what has conspired this week - and   TAKE FUCKING ACTION  . The rich are only able to be this strong due to the collective lack of giving a fuck of the masses. Our CHAD fucking forefathers blessed us with democracy, we just have to use it -   REGISTER TO VOTE   and   VOTE IN EVERY SINGLE ELECTION  , federal, state, local, school board, class president, I don't give a fuck,   VOTE  . Make sure whoever we vote for knows   we fucking HATE WALLSTREET   and want them regulated so they can't keep fucking working people as they have for so long.   Beyond that, any politician who is actually on our side and not taking money from corporations and billionaires -   DONATE TO THEM    Beyond that, get involved in your local community, political change can't happen with the power of memes alone, it happens with local organizing. Talk to your friends, your coworkers, your family, and -   JOIN A LOCAL POLITICAL ORGANIZATION    Beyond that, direct action is how you make them SUFFER. You think they suffered this week with GameStop? Imagine how they'd feel if the labor they make their profits with is withheld.   SUPPORT STRIKES  . I don't know how or when the fuck we're going to have a   GENERAL STRIKE   in America, but   WHEN WE DO YOU BETTER FUCKING BE THERE  .   If you're still asleep to the fact that this is a war, wake the fuck up, this war has been going on since the beginning of civilization. There's plenty we can do, we just have to actually do it. At least now we're not uneducated serfs, we're   RETARDS  , and we have the internet to communicate with one another and disseminate information.   Stay strong
Stop Buying Anything Other than GME
They want you to sell. This dip is artificial and a scare tactic. Do not focus on NOK or BB or fucking AMC. GME is the prize. They need to suffer covering at $1k.
Book The Dip
I'm buying more in the dip.    RIDE WITH ME INTO THE HALLS OF VALHALLA. WHERE TENDIES FILL OUR PLATES AND STONKS ONLY GO UP. HOLD TIGHT AND FUCK THESE WALLSTREET ASSHOLES.   This is not financial advice.

Trading212 will not let you reduce/close GME
They say that you can reduce or close out your position but when trying to reduce or close out my GME position (done as a test) it rejects any attempt to do it.   Is there anything I can do about that?

ROBINHOOD IS OFFICIALLY AN OP!!

You guys saw people saying "eat the rich" and actually put your fucking bibs on and took your bite. I have so much respect for what you're doing and I want to join the next one. This current round got too far before I could afford it.
for everyone who owns GME, AMC, BB, etc. in Robinhood: how to transfer stocks from one broker to another. DO NOT SELL.

I‚Äôm holding the line with y‚Äôall   shares @ $  üó°. I‚Äôve been a longtime lurker and I just gotta say how fucking awesome this community is.  In the face of this immense institutional manipulation I would suggest everyone takes screenshots of the ways they‚Äôre fucking you: blacked out buy button, the notices, your shares, your buying power, and everything else so we can have all the ammunition we need to take class action suits to these fucking brokers trying to keep us broke. At some point we have to stand up to this evil, I know I‚Äôll do everything in my power to make it right.  GME intergalactic     This is not investment advice. I just like the stock. üñï
PSA: FIDELITY is allowing for new account creations and the buying of any stock.
Fidelity is up and running and signing up was super smooth. They allowed for an instant deposit as well so you will be able to continue buying within a few minutes of creating your account.  I will be transferring all of my Robinhood holdings over as soon as I am able.  I am not a financial advisor, just helping spread the good word.
FORGET ROBINHOOD DRAMA - FOCUS ON HODLING
It doesn't matter what Robinhood did this morning. They're wrong and everyone knows it. Complaining about Robinhood all I see on this sub right now, but we can't let the Sheriff of Nottingham's shortsightedness shake us.  How do we outsmart them? What's the fastest brokerage where you can get an account funded and buy the dip? Fidelity? Schwab? Webull?  (And, if you've got shares in Robinhood like I
MAKE SURE TO TWEET AT ROBINHOOD
DO YOUR PART AND TWEET at ROBINHOOD and the SEC. Make sure to write reviews on the App Store. Pressure them to open their BUY back on the platform for all the short squeezes.
What's the next stock?
The anger at Robinhood (and others) is understandable, but CITADEL is the one calling the shots. Don't let them hide in the shadows.
Citadel has billions of dollars invested into none other than Melvin Capital, the main group shorting GME in the first place. Citadel also is embedded deeply in Robinhoood. If Citadel pulls out, Robinhood is essentially fucked. They were strong-armed into removing GME, BB, etc buy orders.  Focus your anger on Citadel and the big fish. They're the ones who need to see some repercussions.
Has everyone given up already?
I bought as much as I could and I‚Äôm holding. Why y‚Äôall sellin?
Trading 212 needs same treatment as Robinhood... can we make it happen?

Best time to buy AMC
Nows the best time to buy AMC , profits about to be insane
If you Think the Chaos Caused with Gamestop is good... Look into SLV.
Just throwing this out there since you guys have found some Low Orbit Ion Cannon Strategy.     So I encourage you guys to look into SLV. There's a massive squeeze on this, not to mention an OBVIOUS LACK OF PHYSICAL BACKING, and blatant High Frequency Trading. If we pop the price above 30 then it becomes a two fold issue. Blackrock and JP Morgan run this show, Blackrock is the hedge fund, and JP Morgan is the bank shorting ETF and Long on physical. I've been working on this for about 6 months, and sunk North of 15k into requesting the physical silver. If we can drain the supply and/or force them to lose control of the SLV manipulation like they lost control of Rhodium futures ($20,000 per troy oz) then it's game over.      Technically speaking, if there's a drain on the physical supply then you guys become the squeezers on not on the banks, but ALL INDUSTRY USE. Cellphones, computers, solar panels, and any electronics need (Can you say TESLA Buying Silver for their cars....?)      All of this kept in mind, along with JPOW running that printer non-stop and the stimulus. The pressure in SLV is set to break the space-time barrier once it's restraints are dissolved.      If you guys pop the price above 30, and the physical requests keep rolling in the damage will be biblical. Between the covering of the shorts and being forced to buy physical silver will ruin them.      Just my two cents. Silver has ruined many banks before in the past, but if you guys use this same strategy.... it will be Jericho's walls.     If you think that Gamestop went parabolic, SLV had the potential to hit Andromeda Galaxy.      God Bless you guys, and keep up the fight. You guys are not alone, we're all chipping away at their power in one way or another. Keep hitting them where it FUCKING HURTS!!!
OGEN & ONTX
Just bought a bunch of OGEN and ONTX. Cheap stocks that used to be way way higher and I think due to covid and things of that nature that these stocks will go up crazy especially if people start buying now.
BUY NOW IF YOU CAN! WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET, ITS LOW! IF YOU ARE BUYING EN MASSE HERES YOUR CHANCE, DONT LET THEM WIN
Cannot believe they actually straight up removed these four stocks from the search results. This is literally a tactic utilized by the Chinese party to control their people.
These are all coordinated attacks and you should be immune to them by now
If you look at what's been happening in the past few days it is crystal clear that Citadel are out for blood and laws are out of the window for them.   They time their short attacks every single time with some kinde of "bad" news. Cnbc reported Melvin and Citron covered, boom it dropped. Robinhood blocked buying, boom it dropped. Robinhood now made an announcement that they are not backing off, boom it dropped again. And EVERY SINGLE TIME it went back up.   How stupid do they think we are? I WILL HOLD UNTIL I'M DEAD.
Eastman Kodak Co. (NYSE: KODK) Let me Tell you a Story
My father worked for Eastman Kodak for almost all of his adult life.  He starved to death in hospice care because of a brain tumor that made it difficult for him to understand what was going on and due to the pandemic the hospital was unwilling to operate.     Now his Kodak stuff is my Kodak stuff.  My father and every father who lived in the Rochester, NY area was told that if they got a job with Kodak they could work their way up and be a middle class success.  The area's economy was based around the yearly "Kodak bonuses" where employees would get checks in the thousands as an extra reward for their good work.  This is when families would get new cars, new living room sets, maybe that vacation to Disney that they always wanted.     Kodak was the first to create digital photographs, but never sought to develop the technology further.  They knew that if the technology was developed it would mean the end of their film business which was massive at the time.  From the 80s onward, Kodak downsized and rightsized and did all these different sizings that left families in the dust.  Kodak bonuses disappeared over time and all my dad would talk about at the dinner table was trying to transfer within the company to avoid the next batch of layoffs.     Kodak went bankrupt a couple years ago.  The market saw that there was blood in the water and when Kodak tried to sell some of its assets to bring in the income it needed to stay afloat the market refused.  After all those same assets will be a lot cheaper from a bankrupt company forced to sell than a non-bankrupt one.  My father was one of the lucky ones.  He transferred to a division within Kodak that ultimately got sold off as Kodak Alaris.  They're the company that makes the Kodak kiosk machines for printing within stores.     Kodak was most recently in the news because of a deal with the Trump administration to manufacture pharmaceuticals.  Kodak has huge experience with chemicals from their photo business and has a large amount of manufacturing space that has been mothballed since the death of film.  That deal was put on hold due to suspicious stock transactions (market manipulation/insider trading), but Kodak was found to not have engaged in any illegal activity.     I think Kodak is a promising company.  It helped build my community.  There are thousands of people in the area who have experience and training, but are stuck in subpar jobs since the Kodak collapse hoping that it returns to prominence.  We have 5 colleges in the area including a state of the art medical center that is university affiliated that can provide the medical expertise needed to help this transition process.  People just need to see Kodak as valuable again.  And if their stock started rising again I believe we would see a wave of positivity for all things Kodak and Kodak-related.     I can provide proof for everything I've talked about.  Here is a picture of my shelf with my father's Kodak clock (which he received after working at Kodak for so many years) as well as some antique cameras I own.   Processing img z4vj9hfli3e61...

DO NOT let these piece of shit trading platforms and hedge funds/MM break your diamond hands. Now is the time to buy.

Why are yall closing accounts just for them all to ban those short squeeze stocks
I think the trend is over and we should just get over it. Never going to win, rich will forever be rich.
THANK YOU RASHIDA VERY COOL
For the first time in many, many years Republicans and Democrats have congregated to take action against the corrupt. We are making history.

No, Webull didn‚Äôt do the same thing as Robinhood.
They‚Äôre in a situation like Gab where their servers can‚Äôt handle the massive influx of Robintards. It is unlikely that they shut down their servers on purpose because why would they do that when they can just do like Robinhood and halt selling?

When both AOC and Trump Jr are on the same page... what a bizarre timeline.
For those that don't know
Hedge funds pay for direct market access to make trades and are ping ponging the meme stock back and forth to each other at a lower price each time pushing it down.  Remember the price reflected is the last trade price. If there is a class action lawsuit, file for discovery against the exchanges themselves.  Get the trade histories and parties involved. Hell, if enough players are involved, a RICO could be in order.
Resorting to "Investing Platforms"
Robinhood turned into Sherriff and now Webull is making me wait 1-2 business days to open an account. No problem. my second M1 (yes, M1) trading window opens at 2pm. Just in time for the drop that is happening as i type this to create a buying window.   No platform is too boomer. FIND A WAY. BUY AND HOLD. WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Best UK app for buying?
Hello,  I was wondering if anyone knew, or had links to a reliable website, that lists the best stock apps in the UK?  Obviously I have heard of Trading 212... but most times the ones you have heard of, are the ones that are backed by business practices that you would wish to avoid.  Many thanks.
Since Robin Hood is run by the men in suits and I want nothing to do with them. What other services are there for a man like me to use to trade?
Do we keep holding??

Old Money is colluding illegally to prevent their losses. All Americans should call their senators asking for investigations into Melvin, Robinhood, et al.
Between the naked short selling, the cnbc misinformation  , and the stock apps halting trading the case has already been made. However the SEC is compromised so only intense pressure could get these people to face justice for their decades of market manipulation. To do so, call up your congressmen demanding an investigation be done. This actually works believe it or not- as long as enough people do so.  Only call your congressmen. Don‚Äôt call ones from other states. Don‚Äôt call if you aren‚Äôt an American citizen.  Here‚Äôs how:

I don't have BB, NOK, GME, or AMC. These plays just weren't for me, and if they are, respect to you. But this has transcended just a trade for profit so that you all can afford your next Chipotle burrito bowl.  This is now a war with the Big Boys, and just goes to show the true power of the collective and the perceived power of the whales. The fact that the sex-deprived, depressed Reddit trader who gets high every other night is making more money than a hedge fund is hilarious to me, and madly ironic. They really ain't shit. Everybody is against you guys - the media is censoring you, whales are desperately trying to manipulate the market against you, and trading platforms even stop you from buying stock. This is the modern Battle of Thermopylae.   So guess what? Just because these cunts are trying so hard for you to fail, now my ass is gonna buy these stocks so that I can be part of the movement that sticks our dicks in the Big Guns' asses. Even if I lose money, I know that I was part of this historic crusade.
Pause! Breathe! Don‚Äôt panic sell! This is their last try to win this war! No matter what happens as long as zog just hold, from tomorrow on they will bleed like hell!!! GME into the fucking stratosphere
GME float -   HOLD THE LINE! We got this!
Doing fine! Keep holding! Keep holding!
The SEC needs to step in regarding Robinhood limiting purchase on GME, NOK, AMC, and BB. In addition, the SEC also needs to step in regarding the Stash app being down, halting buying and selling of all stock. Launch your complaints, be professional, and   fucking  .
GME suspended again. Keep holding and enjoy the show!
It‚Äôs not even about the money now. Just hold! Fuuuck em.

Just throwing this out there as a possibility, not saying it's actually happening. And I'm not suggesting that the hedge funds have or have not closed their shorts...  But investors who are continuing to buy $GME based on the fact that they believe the hedge funds have not closed their shorts due to the elevated short interest, need to consider that there are other ways to "close" the position without coving the short.   Option 1: They could simply buy GME shares without closing the short. Effectively holding 2 positions, one long, one short. Their P&L is then hedged and they are no longer suffering losses if the stock keeps moving higher. They are not required to cover their shorts when they buy the stock. They could even effectively have a long position in GME by doing so. The $  loan that they received could very well have been used in this fashion.   Option 2: There are other ways as well, using derivatives for one. Exchange listed or OTC derivatives such as forwards, swaps or options can be utilized as well to "cover" to create a synthetic hedge without actually covering the short stock position.  It is again, entirely possible that they have an effective long positions in GME now, profiting from the extreme moves to the upside and no longer losing money on this short.
WE NEED TO FIND A NEW BET TO TAKE TO THE MOON!
With the meme stocks meeting a ton of resistance for an ever increasing number of brokerages we need to migrate over to another stock, or stocks (preferably 2-3) and keep this trend going.   By splitting up into BB, GME, NOK, and AMC we have diluted the WSB buying power. We need to pick a new stock to meme and hit it hard before they have a chance to shut us out of it!
Why gamestop fell to 250 from 400 within an hour, sorry no panic i just don't understand the market.
IS ROBINHOOD BACK?
Anyone US based wanna confirm or deny (preferably by buying GME?)
Has anyone who had pending purchases for NOK on CashApp been able to get it to go through?
I ordered my NOK shares last night almost 12 hours before the market opened. It said they would be bought at 9:30 AM and it‚Äôs almost 11!!! It won‚Äôt let me cancel it either! And as long as you have a pending purchase you can‚Äôt buy anything else...
They CHANGED the rules of the GAME MID-GAME. HOLD.
First, let me begin by saying I'm not a massive holder of GME. I own a bit because I think it's a fun trade and it's worth it to be part of this.  Now, everything that's going on re: platforms not allowing investors to buy (Robinhood, IB, Schwabb, etc.) is considerably FUCKED UP.  The strategy for this has always been one thing. To exploit the short-sellers who made stupid bets on what they thought was a risk-less strategy. We are not investing in GameStop or basing this on fundamentals like their cash flows. That's fucking obvious. The fact that the media is saying that we are is the biggest straw-man argument because it's not at all fucking why we're invested.  Look at the short interest/float on GME. 250%.  Look at the call options open on GME. THIS IS JUST FOR THE END OF THIS WEEK.    1,157 call contracts @ $50   1,487 call contracts @ $59   5,880 call contracts @ $60   11,145 call contracts @ $100   12,338 call contracts @ $115  Let me also remind you that each call option contract is 100 shares.  When they get CALLED on FRIDAY, they will need to purchase GME at the respective strikes totaling $303,175,300. Investors can sell that for $  billion USD if the price settles around $500. THAT'S THE FUCKING VALUE OF THIS TRADE. AND IT GETS BETTER AS THE PRICE GOES UP.  Does it suck for these hedge funds that they're all fucked? Yes. But they're HEDGE funds. They MANAGE risk and they totally failed their job because they SOUGHT out risk while the entire time thinking OH THIS IS A RISK-LESS TRADE.  Fuck that. You played a strategy and you LOST. Now you're asking exchanges to restrict trading because you left your king open for an easy checkmate? Too fucking bad.  These exchanges are bailing out hedge funds for being greedy and dumb. Fuck them. All investors need to do is HOLD onto their shares until Friday. Do whatever you want if you need to take profits, but know that by selling you are fucking over the collective and bailing out these hedge funds.
BUY AMC OR NO???
I'm scared help :(
This is No Longer Just About the Money. This is a War.
#believeinWSB BUY or HOLD GME, AMC, NOK #Holdstrong
Guys as the stocks fall, don't panic or fear. Yes, Robinhood and other platform are showing us the true colors and are restricting.  What revolution didn't have any friction? This should fuel us more! Fidelity, Schwab and others are allowing us to still trade!  We will win!  THIS IS THE WAY - #believeinWSB!
Submit complaints to Robinhood and SEC
I just submitted a complaint to both Robinhood and the SEC regarding trading restrictions. I recommend everyone do the same. Flood them with complaints to get our point across. THIS IS ILLEGAL.
Realistically, what price do you think AMC is going to go to?
Doing my part because I like the stock. Fuck Robinhood, imagine naming your company Robinhood and then openly manipulating the market to favor the rich. I hope every last one of these fuckers will live to regret this month for the rest of their lives. I LIKE THE STOCK
Just bought what I could on that dip on WeBull, they are still pushing through GME buy.
They're scared of us
They're doing everything possible to drive down the prices because they're scared. They know they have one day remaining to make us panic before many of their options expire.  They have a very far reach, we have seen the power of their corruption. Stay strong kings we still hold the majority, and I think most of us know that, and I think that makes them even more afraid of us.     Good luck.
Europeans were block from buying since yesterday!! Now Americans can‚Äôt buy today!! Does a country can buy? If so, please HOLD!! FUCKING HOLD
I‚Äôm European and I was completely fuck by this system when yesterday I wasn‚Äôt able to buy just sell. Today looks like is not only Europe but Americans to. This was the thing that we could finally get some revenge on the hedge funds after all they did indirectly or directly to our families and close ones. I‚Äôm here since the beginning 20shares at 60+\- even after all the halts, fake news, more ilegal stuff that happened we stood together as the retards we are and actually we‚Äôre winning this battle! After today I‚Äôm not selling and neither you should. Let‚Äôs make the hedge funds fucking bleed the max amount of time we can. All I can say is the system is fucking broken but we no matter what happens, already win something I‚Äôm proud of all of you degenerates and retards.
Pretty much got in to a war with my mom about wanting to put $5000 into GME.
Yelled and yelled and then we talked and she said if I wanted to then I could and then they shut me down and wouldn‚Äôt let my guy at Edward Jones buy it. Me and my mom are cool but I just wanted to do this to make her proud and have extra money! Just told my guy to send me $2000 instead in the mail 1K each for the both of us  . I‚Äôll be watching over the weekend and maybe put in then! If not I‚Äôll just take my mom and I somewhere nice for vacation after Covid! Have fun at the top getting rich guys. I‚Äôm down -88 right now in AMC but I‚Äôm going to hold! Take every last cent they own and bankrupt those mother fuckers for me!
Never invested before now I'm $2k deep in $GME and $AMC.
I don't have much but Robbinhood can suck it.  My poor ass is with you guys.  Stay strong!
Would it be possible to short the hedge funds?
We need to open our own brokerage with all of our GME gains
Fuck Robinhood. Fuck TDA. Invest in Tendie Bros.

It‚Äôs not just stocks anymore that are being blocked by Robinhood
Call your Congressmen NOW! We need to remind them they work for all of us and not just the 1% and this market manipulation is unacceptable.
Just do it. Don't wait. Flood them. Say that another bailout for the billionaires would mean they're never getting your vote.
Simmer down now. Don't panic: Hold or Buy
If you bought GME recently, or are looking at AMC, BB, NOK: Buy and hold.  Ignore the ever-changing prices and look at the big picture.  If you're not comfortable seeing a loss right now, don't show up here at all.  Just close the app, take a walk and chill.  Hold the line (or buy what you're willing to lose) on the big four in this sub: AMC, BB, GME, NOK
MAYBE YOU CANT BUY BUT YOU STILL CAN HOLD
We need to hold!!!! Tomorrow is payday!!!!
The war has just begun.
Hold AMC and GME, you degenerates. Buy as much as you can.   The war has just begun
FILE SEC COMPLAINTS
This is fucking bullshit and the goddamn govt needs to know how many people are fucking pissed. Only takes about 2 min online. TELL THEM THE FUCK OFF! WE LIKE THE STOCK

Guys, I know this seems tough but it is merely manipulation from the big bois.  Be strong, hold.   Find somewhere to buy at this new price and hold.  We‚Äôre still ready for the moon
This is your last chance to earn alot of money on GME. Currently on 264 as im writing this
UPVOTE FOR GNE LUCK Buy now! It is a massive dip! Its INSANE how much money you can make if you buy GME TODAY. Tomorrow is the SHORT SQUEEZE. Just bought 10 more shares. LETS REACH THE STARS!!!üìàüìàüìà
Cheers to WSB, From going all in at Tesla at 1500 (pre split) even though those around me told me I was stupid to buying into pltr, nio, purple, gamestop, AMC, etc.
Kill Robinhood - You need to trade elsewhere
Title says it all. RH has clearly fucked it's traders by stopping the buying and searching of certain stocks. Switch to a more reputable brokerage. I've been able to trade on TD no problem.

DONT SELL HOLD YOUR STOCKS NO MATTER WHAT
Can we talk honestly for a second?
I know everyone is trying to stick it to the man, and I love seeing a bunch of individuals make money while hedge funds bleed as much as the next guy, BUT  Everyone is here for the squeeze. Not because GameStop is all of a sudden a good company. So let‚Äôs say we accomplish this anarchist goal of destroying Melvin Capital. I love that. But then what? Who is holding the bag? Thousands of poor retail investors that we all told to HOLD THE LINE while the smarter (or dumber based on your perspective) people in WSB sell.   Everyone needs to take a hard look at what‚Äôs going on here. We are blaming Robinhood and SEC, but they don‚Äôt want people to get FUCKED out of their mind. Melvin capital can eat a dick. But a lot of people here are going to be eating a dick right alongside Melvin.   Whatever comes from this, just remember that this situation hurts thousands of people who probably can‚Äôt afford to lose the money because they saw Mia Khalifa tweeting and don‚Äôt know any better. We created this animal, we gotta take responsibility to.   I‚Äôm sure this will get downvoted, but that only furthers the point that what we are doing here is going to fuck the common man just as much as the hedge fund.   Good luck.
Transferring positions from Robinhood
Is anyone able to post details on how to transfer your positions from RH into another trading app? Seems to me the clearest way to send a message is to clear all of our trades out of RH and somewhere else where we can actually exercise our right to buy and sell the stocks we like.

A strategy for GME fomo aka fuck the market makers too
I like many doubted the power of WSB before the absurd surge in GME. While I'll never doubt the buying power of retards again, I'm effectively priced out of GME now. But the attacks against the institution don't need to stop.  If you can still buy options in GME there is a safe(ish) way to make a ton of money and fuck over market makers in the process.  Sell  put options. The historically high IV of GME has made option premiums completely unreasonable. As a result you can sell OTM puts for ridiculous percentages at strike prices that are almost(key word) impossible to be exercised.  Right now a Mar. 19th 20p has a bid price of $  (Skip this part if you're not retarded) Selling a put means you're agreeing to buy 100 shares at the strike price. So at the contract expiration you want the put to be OTM in which case all your premium they paid you is free money. If it's ITM you can choose to settle for cash or receive the shares. So you're effectively committing to buy GME at 20$ a share on March 19th and being paid today for it.  A lot of brokerage services aren't letting people short GME or buy it on margins if even allowing it at all. This is a way to leverage the rest of your portfolio to benefit from the immediate volatility. Premiums are changing a lot so check out them all.     Holdings:  GME mar19th puts at $15 and $22  GME July 16th puts at $5(2)
Y‚Äôall jump on the9 stock and help the Robinhooders out they blocked gme
My friend is trying to defend hedge funds right now. What do I tell him?
Don‚Äôt let this illegal shit keep the everyday person down
Don‚Äôt let this illegal shit keep the everyday person down

I just bought AMC @16USD and know I'm down by 50%. What should I do?  Edit: I'm going to follow your guys advice and hold. 57% down but fuck it. AMC
Still plenty of room in NAKD for anyone who missed out on the big

GME Scares
Y'all, I've put all of my money into this. Are we still holding? How can we be sure that this GME is going to rise again?
BUY BUY BUY
Once the Robinhood opens AMC GME etc buy as much as you can we‚Äôre going to the moon. Still holding my shares
EFF Robinhood!
I‚Äôm sure this will get buried.   I have a bunch of money In The market, but it‚Äôs all tied up in long term positions.   After seeing robinhood block purchases, I jumped on my E TRADE account, sold a few things and bought.   Only 10 shares, but, more as a solidarity move.  Screw these suits who think they can manipulate the rest of us.  It‚Äôs worth it to lose the money.  I‚Äôm with you (Us?)  Edit:if it wasn‚Äôt already clear, E TRADE hasn‚Äôt halted buying for what it‚Äôs worth.
TRADING RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSION - ROBHINHOOD/AMERITRADE/ETRADE

SHORTS HAVE NOT COVERED.
I repeat the shorts have not covered
The people panic selling aren‚Äôt on WSB, it‚Äôs the people getting involved from tiktok & twitter
DO NOT SELL. Big Corpo is trying to stack the cards in their favor. It was effective in getting the weak to sell, but this is far from over. This is where we come back at them twice as hard. NOW IS WHEN THE BOYS BECOME MEN. GME BB SNDL AMC NOK
Telegram Proposal (hear me out)
I suggest we move some discussion over to Telegram out of view of the press for more coordinatated moves. For a small nominal fee ($5 or $10) or just a short survey to vet incoming members. Like discord but nicer. Unless this is truly private. But the chat community was cool when it wasn't being mean and all the stuff that made discord kick them. Just a suggestion.
GME to BB
Unfortunately, GME looks down down, but Is this good news for BB and NOK?

Theory: Citadel executes RH orders
I think that Citadel execution services stopped allowing orders for GME buys and I THINK RH's only execution firm is Citadel.   So if Citadel ES refuses to broker for RH then RH has no choice but to only allow sells.   Citadel also has interest in keeping the cost of the stock low.   However I have trouble believing that they could convince RH to implode itself like this.
Why's the pinned GME post gone?

GME TO THE MOON HOLD
This is it
This is the time to hold. The only people selling are the ones with billions to lose. The rest of us can keep holding until we lose all our recent gains, and in the next few days we‚Äôll be up higher than ever. Those holding and buying hasn‚Äôt changed, these aristocrats are just selling to each other to catch us off guard. WE WILL PREVAIL! They think they can scare the little guy into submission, but it‚Äôs our job to show them that it‚Äôs not possible. We‚Äôre in it for the long game, not matter how long that is. All of us deserve to be in the green, and with     we‚Äôll all be there. HOLD my brothers and sister, WE OWN THIS MARKET!!!! BUY AND HOLD!!!!
ELI5: suspending stocks
hi would someone please explain how the market is able to suspend stocks whenever they want? i‚Äôm confused on how this is legal tysm
It isn't just Robinhood. Webull has haulted purchasing as well.
Webull fucking me all morning not letting me buy stocks and now you can't buy gme or others either. "suspended" yet the price keeps going down hmm..
Reddit was down for 15 minutes for me while the stock started to plummet. Prepare for such tactics where they try to cut us away from one another while the market is being manipulated! HOLD!
I'm not a financial advisor and was forced to make this post.
Robinhood as we speak
WHY THE F ARE YALL SELLING. YALL DID THIS SO FINISH IT.
Put in to buy bb 3 hours ago and buy still pending on Revolut. :(
Webull is no longer allowing their users to purchase GME shares either. Despite their "volatility" concerns, the actions of these brokers has caused GME to drop almost 50% intraday. This. Is. UNACCEPTABLE.
This game is rigged so hard against anyone not in the elite it's not even funny anymore.
WE'VE SEEN BIG DROPS LIKE THIS BEFORE. HOLD, THE SHORT SQUEEZE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IS COMING SOON!
Revolut in Europe is issuing this warning in the trading section. THEY‚ÄôRE TRYING TO SCARE US
Sign up for class action lawsuit
This is a simulated crash on GME. DO NOT PANIC!
Hedges and big money are dumping shares to fake a crash to make your hands paper! Do not fold! Keep your hands diamond and if you are able, buy the dip!! We only win this if we hold the line!      ‚úä     Disclosure: I am not a financial adviser, this is not financial advice. I just like the stock.
We are in the dip before the BIG SQUEEZE - this is VW chart for reference.
Why is trading stopped when GME goes up but not when hedge funds artificially force it down?
You can buy AMC and NOK on CashApp
Super quick and easy
The volume isn't large enough for them to cover. It proves that we are all holding and this will have to go up
we, dumb money. dumb money logo stuff for sale with free shipping, profits yoloed on gme
if this isnt allowed im sorry just let it get lost  i made a cool dumb money logo and put it on some stuff if anyone wants any of it, free shipping and all proceeds go to GME
HELP WITH THIS
IM TRYING TO BUY AT A DIP, WHAT APP STILL ALLOWS YOU TO BUY GME
MARKET MANIPULATION
Apparently some platforms removed the option to buy GME and only to sell therefore forcing the price to go down...  "bUt iTs nOt MArkEt maNiPulAtIOn" - Wallstreet
What‚Äôs all this about
Are ya‚Äôll just pumping gme as high as you can to screw over hedge funds? (That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learn‚Äôt from some comments here tbh) This seems like a historical internet moment for some reason but I have no idea what‚Äôs happening lmao, what can I do to help
HOLD HOLD HOLD
For once in your damn life do something meaningful and FUCKING HOLD
It's over $1000!?!
TDA, Schwab, Robinhood, and others, have all prevented buy orders for GME, AMC, NOK, BB, BBBY, Etc.
The suits won
Sorry guys, but the recent acts by Robinhood really killed my spirits.  I am thinking of selling all at a loss and moving on.   I thought I was buying a one way ticket to the moon, and right as we were gonna take off, Robinhood and the suits took a massive dump on my head and told me to go home.  I don't think I can invest in a market where the suits get to make up the rules as they go, and the little guy has no shot to make a fair buck.  Goodbye you retards, it's been fun.
Alright knobtards, it‚Äôs dip buying time. Let‚Äôs get this fuckin bread.
This is the way.  It‚Äôs still short as fuck.
If $GME keeps going down I will lose everything.
I‚Äôm all in on $GME. No cash in bank account. All spent on $GME.   Moved everything from retirement accounts.   BUY MORE SHARES. HOLD WHAT YOU HAVE.
Woooooo! Looking like buy territory boys! Dip and a half! Snatch it up and hold on tight!
Just remember that Robinhood is going to IPO relatively soon
It would be a real shame if Robinhood got shorted into the ground when that happens.
DD Request: What happens if the selling in $GME continues?
Like many here, I‚Äôm holding strong.     But considering there‚Äôs 100%+ short positions, what happens if the selling continues?   Are the short sellers going to be able to all cover their positions?  Will the price go back up again or continue sliding as short sellers cover?  Would love some DD from some of you retards who actually know what‚Äôs going on. Think it would help all of us hold strong!!
DONT FUCKING SELL. WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.
Stop fucking selling. I believed in this, and you should too. They only way we prosper is by working together! Yesterday was a magical moment. Time to make today just like yesterday! There's still plenty of time- DO NOT CAPITULATE.   If we work together that's our only shot of beating these fuckers. That's why big media, big corporations have pinned Americans against one another because they know if we all came together their empires would be shattered. This is our moment of hope.
Now that this place is successful the newbies have no fallback
Wall Street bets, now thriving, have changed. Gone are the days when you read a post about buying cheap stocks. Now it is all about a few buying 100s or 1,000s of shares at the cost of 50-100+   Dropping $10,000+ as if middle America (the average working-class) could do so with ease. And realistically, we all know that's not true.     I do congratulate you on your success. But I will miss the days when there were posts about how the "little guy" and average working American could get in on the ground floor.
Not fucking selling - Average is $250 per share
GUESS WHERE GME IS
How can I go to the moon now?
Title. Now that Robinhood and WeBull are not allowing me to create accounts, is there anywhere that I can sign up to start trading?
PLTR BUY THE DIP!!!

The GME saga could be the undoing of retail traders
You retards have amassed to much attention and power, the brokerage shitshow is just the start, they are going to use this $gme story to regulate the hell out of the market which will ultimately only hinder the retail investors ability to make money. They are likely going to make it very difficult to trade. Possibly eliminating options trades for the plebs
STOP SELLING GME
We will only win if we hold.  No matter how low it goes, HOLD ON TO YOUR GME!!!!!!!!
RobinHood is manipulating the FREE MARKET!!!

HOLD. DO NOT FORGET WHAT HAPPENED.
WEBULL IS DOWN - HOLD YOUR POSITIONS

What stock manipulation really looks like   üèª HOLD
How can the rest of the world get involved?

This is no longer a matter of how much money you make, it's a matter of principle. IF YOU SELL THEY WIN.
ü©∏ ü©∏ ü©∏ RATE THEM DOWN ON GOOGLE PLAY / APP STORE
Upvote so more people see it. Robinhood and the other brokers doing market manipulation to save their daddys hedge funds. Vote them fucking down on Google Play and App Store. Hurt them where it hurts.
HOLD
Brokerages are only allowing you to sell shares now. So consider who is buying your shares if no one on your platform is allowed to buy... it‚Äôs the big boys getting a free pass to buy BUT ONLY IF YOU SELL. HOLD THE LINE DO NOT GIVE THESE GUYS A FREE PASS!
Should I sell my banned shares on robinhood & move to webull instead?
Before you say anything hear me out. I‚Äôm a very small investor only investing around $200 in every share total. I want to buy more of stocks like $amc, $bb & $nok, however, I can‚Äôt do that on robinhood. Should I just sell what I have on robinhood & move to webull instead? The only problem is that I have about $64 of buying power on robinhood
GME FELL, DO NOT SELL THAT MEANS IT IS DISCOUNT HOUR!!
DONT GET DISCOURAGED AND SELL, this our OUR hour! Buy and buy and buy! Cashapp, shwab! All that! Buy what you can while it‚Äôs cheap!!!!

What a crazy story! And while I‚Äôm Forest Gump when it comes to finances, I had a delighted laugh listening to how you guys bucked the system, screwed the Boomer fat cats, and some of you made out millionaires. Great story!
WHERE INSTANT DEPOSiT??
who‚Äôs gonna let me buy more GME instantly???? Robin Hood is fucking us! SERIOUSLY WHERE TO BUY MORE??
When the squeeze is over... CANCEL YOUR ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT
I don‚Äôt care where you move to.. TD, Etrade, your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôa brokerage, etc. Robinhood branded themselves as being here for us, the retail investors. They have decided to fuck us so let‚Äôs fuck them harder. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS, MAKE THEM BLEED AND REGRET BEING SLIMY SCUM  Also, I am not a financial advisor.
Saagar Enjeti: Shut it down!

Let's boycott these brokers who are blocking!!! My wife's boyfriend has a lot of money I can move.
TDA and RH don't let me buy my FDs let's boicott these fuckers. This will really hurt them. My wife's boyfriend has a lot of money and I'm his manager so if we all take out our wife's boyfriend's money we will hurt them a shit ton and they have to unlock our FDs
$NAKD isn‚Äôt citadel the largest SH here? Aren‚Äôt we helping the people trying to crush us?
Lets say a short squeeze is coming
How high do expect it to go and how long before it drops immensely?
Did anyone else see GME's ASK pop to 1000 and 5000? I'm not going crazy right?
GameStop is about to be a mom because I‚Äôm not pulling out
Keep buying and holding retards
we are loosing this fight because of corrupt brokers
its so sad this is what the market has come to. I'm very sorry for anyone in loss this is complete fucking bullshit. FUCK WALL ST CORRUPT BOOMERS
Help spread the word and inform your fellow retards and autists. Knowledge is power, do not allow fake news to control the story.
No matter how much these corrupt, malicious, greedy, black market cretins try to attack us or sway the public opinion, you must inform your fellow retards of the truth. Do what you can, anyone with cards on the table or even an interest in social issues needs to be spreading the word.  It is very simple. These corrupt forces have been attacking WSB continuously it's not just today. They have one goal and that is to lower the price so they can close out their positions and avoid bankruptcy. Every single time one you or any other shareholder sees a peak or a massive dip and decides to sell you edge the scales in favour of corruption. Every share purchased edges us, you, the people closer to victory.   But what we have on our sides that a lot of people don't realise is TIME. As time passes and this thing grows even more, interest pushes the price up, more and more people jump on this rocket ship. If we wait and we hold we win. These corrupt organisations do not have time, they cannot "hold" their positions. They have to close. It's so SIMPLE, don't let anything scare or deter you just keep informing everyone on reddit and out of it that they must BUY and HOLD.  TLDR BUY & HOLD make  go far. SELL make corrupt corporations and individuals richer.
What catalysts are going to drive the price back up?
It‚Äôs pretty deep in the red, what‚Äôs going to drive the price back up???? And WHEN!?
Wealthsimple still doing orders while everything's through the floor
AMC and NOK are gonna shoot back up right?
You know what, I take it back. We will never make history, we are controlled, and that will never change.
Can't even see the GME ticker anymore on search on many platforms.  We are controlled, easily manipulated, and that will never change.     I was quite optimistic but now, no.     Thank you for ruining the lives of me, and many others.
Manipulation
They're manipulating the market. Freezing it every dip so panic sellers will freak the frick out and sell it
I've been blocked from helping but I am in solidarity...
I have been trying to get money into these stocks all morning and have been blocked at every step. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Fidelity won't let me put money in. Robinhood blocked it all, and Webull is on a waiting game.   When/if I get to put money in I   I will hold.  Thank you for everything you guys are doing and I will be there soon.
Set your Sell limits GME
Go in and make sure you have your high sell limit. orders in place.   we will hold while they manipulate the market this morning  fuckers think they tricked us
Part of the war effort is reaching out to your non-retarded friends about the blatant cheating happening today
While you can‚Äôt buy, take some time to make social media posts, talk to friends, loved ones, COMMUNICATE in any way possible about how Wall Street and the system is fucking over the little guys.  Any resistance needs propaganda, do your part!    üí™  ü§ö $GME
Another app blocks purchases ü§¶
FUCK THE BEARS BUY MORE SHARES
$AMC $GME $BB AND ALL THE OTHER SQUEEZES
Are they kidding me? All of them?
So now platforms are stepping in to regulate trading, saying that we can liquidate but can't buy.  The last time I was losing a ton of money I don't remember E TRADE or RH stepping in to say hold on, you're losing too much we're gonna halt trading and not let you buy.   Who the fuck are the trading platforms to say we're going to throttle, let you sell off positions? This is flat out manipulation, but only when hedge funds are losing.  Would they have stepped in while these stocks were driven into the ground and we lost?  So as more people say "wow this is manipulation trying to get themselves off a sinking ship! I want to buy too"   They are saying you can't! We're protecting you as a new investor! Or you can't we feel that too many people are involved.  Fuck this.  Who the fuck are they!  Hold hold hold hold them all.  Fuck them all.
DO NOT SELL. WE KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DIP ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS HOLD THE SHORTERS ARE FUCKED NO MATTER WHAT      STAND STRONG THIS IS FAR FROM OVER
THIS IS THEIR LAST EFFORT IVE LOST HALF MY PROFITS TODAY BUT I AINT FUCKING LEAVING. JUST HOLD THE LINE DO NOT PANIC SELL. WE WILL WIN HOLD STRONG
SOFI has not blocked any stocks and supports instant transfers up to $5k
Don't be locked out of the action by immoral apps manipulating the market. SoFi is bogged down rn, it took about an hour for my 'instant' funds to go through, but I just placed an order on GME and it went through.
Help on investing for GME/AMC
Im an idiot when it comes to investing, i tried using webull but they won't let me use GME now.. Anywhere I can buy GME stock, or is there a thread already made with that information?

So we can ban you.
If you sold I feel bad for you. The retail investor response will be cataclysmic.
$NAK is fresh squeeze

How do I invest???
Bloomberg Radio just announced list of brokerages that are no longer allowing GME, AMC, NOK, etc. to trade or open new options. All to pROtECt tHE rETaiL iNVEsToR!!! Guys, leave Robinhood to really stick it to the man (Citadel). Goldman is still open for the funds to trade!!
This should be illegal!

DO NOT SELL AND LIQUIDATE AND BUY THIS DIP!!!!!
They are giving us the best opportunity of your life right now!!!
It's over, for those who are gambling with life savings sell and don't be stupid, for those who has extra money Don't sell, rise to the moon.
The peak was over but there is still time, for those idiots who put in their life saving to this please sell and don't be stupid.  For those who have their extra money in this shit (how it should be) Hold the fuck out, it's the ride that matters. Can you cash out yes? Will it skyrocket to 1000 later? Also yes.  The point is, I know many people are putting their life saving in this and it's just stupid, just sell now before it crashes don't be greedy and fuck up your future, only gamble on what you can lose.

Schwab, TD Ameritrade and Robinhood all use Citadel for order flow. Citadel has $  stake in Melvin Capital $  and indirectly $GME short. All Citadel brokers ban purchase of $GME? HELLO?!
The blatant market manipulation and conflict of interest here is perverse and astounding. I don't have to flesh out to many of you how corrupt this is.  I want to hammer home one last point.  If you can only sell your Gamestop stock today - and you can't buy.   And no on else can buy.   Who do you think are scooping up your cheap sell orders right this moment?  HOLD THE FUCKING LINE
First off I would like to say this is not investment advice. But in light of recent events, i feel that $CMCSA (Nbc universal, cnbc parent) is a very poor company and it would be a shame if there was a consensus that they were overvalued
If they are blocking the market from purchasing there is NO point in selling cuz no one CAN buy anyway... if we all hold it will hold.. HOLD BITCHESSS #hedgetrimmers
ROBINHOOD LITERALLY REOPENED GME FOR BUYING AND THEN CLOSED IT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DIP

Legitimately saving America's economy
I don't think you've realized just how much we have caused. We have brought companies from the grave and gave the middle finger to the big shits like Robinhood while piling up cash. We are showing just how easy it is to do amazing things with the help of others. If more young kids actually do something beneficial, the economy will literally be saved. People just have to be interested in what they are doing, and if that means investing in meme companies, so be it. Thank you for listening to my TedTalk but I have to go make some money; bye.
Short interest update
Anyone have a short interest update ?
Covino and Rich on Sirius Xm 103 are calling out Robinhood and everyone else live on air for manipulating the market and explaining to the masses what is happening.
Listening in at work and they are just absolutely shitting on them all live on air and calling out their hypocrisy. Even the normest of normies know this is wrong but the SEC is turning a blind eye to it so far... fucking ridiculous.      On the flip side it's awesome everyone is coming together to fight against all this illegal activity. The tide is rising and it cannot be stopped no matter how hard they try.
The dip is fake. Switch to Fidelity if you can.
ATTENTION:
Robinhood may have taken away your rights to buy GME and BB however you still wield power in another form. WealthSimple is a $0 commission company based in Canada. It prides itself on giving the average person access to the stock market and the financial tools to profit from it. One issue is that you can only buy whole shares and not partial. In any case please consider this as an option, if not than do your best to hold. Best of luck to you all.

Robinhood - Mass Exodus Required
I know everyone loves their UI and they make things pretty much idiot proof, but time and time again Robinhood has failed us, and this time has actively tried to make us lose money.   By hiding equities like GME, NOK, AMC, etc from the search AND making these equities SELL ONLY they are blatantly deliberately and maliciously manipulating the market.   I encourage EVERYONE to wait out this absolute shit storm. Try and hold your positions if you can, it seems there may be   already in process which means these restrictions may be lifted sooner rather than later and in which case we will see all of these stocks rocket right back to where they were.   HOWEVER, AFTERWARDS, EVERYBODY NEEDS TO LEAVE. Every single person with an account needs to withdraw their funds and close their account. MAKE THEM SUFFER. There are plenty of other platforms who don‚Äôt crash during volatility and don‚Äôt prevent us from trading like Robinhood has. Fidelity for example is free and I think you can even import assets from another brokerage directly without selling / re-buying. Ive heard TD-Ameritrade is decent as well.   THIS IS A MATTER OF PRINCIPAL. This is incredibly important to me. Every day I see more freedoms and liberties stripped from us. Manipulation, censorship, and control. We as people cannot continue to let things slide. You have to make a stance and you have to push the issue.   I wish everyone the best of luck through this bullshit, try to keep fighting.

Robinhood Alternatives Thread
With Robinhood pulling bullshit moves on investors I wanted to get us started on thinking about bailing on Robinhood completely. Class Action lawsuit is a great start, but it would be even better if we give them a Class Action Lawsuit AND switch to a different broker. I'm gonna get started with some alternatives that are no-fee trading and where they are headquartered.  This is a list of Brokers that didn't fuck with peoples' GME trades and aren't owned by WallStreet / have conflict of interest BS like Robinhood.  Would love WSB's input on any other options and I will close out with peoples' favorite for us to switch to.   Note: I'll keep making edits to the below and additions to the list:    Hold off on switching immediately until we get a good consensus from people also in case you are eligible for compensation from the Class Action Lawsuit     Name HQ Website Description   :- :- :- :-     New York, USA / Copenhagen, Denmark   Stock trading social network   M1 Finance Chicago, USA         # Shitpile   Name Messed with Peoples' Trades (GME, AMC, BB, etc.)?   :- :-   TD Ameritrade Yes   Robinhood Yes - Completely banned GME buying along with AMC, BB and others   E\ Trade No - but owned by WallStreet (Morgan Stanley)   Charles Schwab Yes   Ally Bank Investing platform shut down on 1/27 for majority of the day inhibiting all trades

Unable to buy GME on Trading212
On T212 we get this message "due to buy restrictions placed by our intermediary and every major execution venue worldwide, games top will be placed in close-only mode. New buy positions can't be initiated, existing ones can be reduced or closed"  What is this bullshit? Is there anywhere (UK) I can put in a complaint about this because this seems to be outright restricting retail investors from being able to do what hedgefunds can and just protecting their arses.
AMC Suspensions
Anybody keeping track of how many suspensions AMC has had this week? From what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs been more than GME. Absolutely ridiculous
GME at $196 Buy The Dip!
ROCKET IS PRIMED, ADVENTURE AWAITS.
BB TO 50$ BY END OF DAY? REALISTIC
There is only going to be so long that these corrupt platforms can halt trading and continue to make it seem as if stock price is falling. What they don‚Äôt realise is we will force them into a position where they will have to reopen the gates and let us buy.   What happens when they open the gates to everyone again.? There will be so much volume the platforms will freeze and price will at least double.   If you can see the momentum right now. Then buy the dip. If you have paper hands then get out of here.
They are selling borrowed shares to eachother. Do not sell hold. They will all be broke and wiping our asses for nickels

It's not just Robinhood - I can't even buy GME or AMC on my Schwab account.
Their message says:  "In the interest of helping to reduce risk due to recent market volatility, we've put in place restrictions on certain securities. These restrictions may include increasing margin requirements or limiting certain types of transactions."  Horsesh t.   Anyway, bought some NOK.

Why mainstream media's slander of wallstreetbets pisses me off regarding GME.
very nice video and explanation.
Don't Give Up
I bought $AMC stock weeks before any of this happened because I go there often, now brokerages are affecting my gains
How is this fair at all to anyone? Why am I being punished as well as other shareholders because brokers like Robinhood appeal to suits rather than the average joe?
How do I get started?
I've been reading up for the last week on what's been going on. I'm a 40 year old guatemalan immigrant who's been in the US since I was 17. This isn't a sob story but obviously I had no generational wealth or fallback of any sort, no one to teach about credit, career advice, all of the things that help open doors. So the mistakes I made through my 20's and in my early 30's really put my in a bind.    Little by little I've been able to scrape together bits of education through classes and positioned myself in a tech position that pays me okay (for Ohio) and does offer a decent future. Due to the mistakes made financially over the years, I'm really only now just getting into the ballpark of being stable financially.    The most frustrating thing is that the amount of $ it would take to really give me a fighting chance to cross from feeling financially burdened/pressured and into a position of being able to actually save for my future is so low. Though I'm making decent money now, I care for my girlfriend who suffers from some autoimmune diseases and I want to offer her a future where she doesn't have to work so much and so hard and can rest her body... and to leave something behind for her one day and her son as well.    I see what's happened this week and people's stories of being able to pay things off, care for their loved ones, build a nest egg... for me being able to make something to the tune of $10-20k would be transformative to a degree that I can't emphasize. My old personal debts are only a couple thousand, I owe about 5k to the IRS in taxes due to a stupid mistake, and I have about 18k in student loans from the classes I've taken over the years, and some pet related medical bills.    I'm tired of feeling trapped and constantly seeing my hard earned money drain away when I'm maddeningly close to having it gone. I can't save like this very well, and I've felt like I've been dying a death by a thousand cuts for some time. Working just to try and break even. Seeing all of this play out gave me some hope that I could maybe climb out of a good portion. I don't have much, meaning it's tough for me to take the step of putting a couple hundred bucks into something but I'm willing to if I had the right guidance. I'm willing to put in the work and yes even some risk which goes with the territory I understand.    But I don't know where to start. I've never played the stock market in my life, I don't know what step 1 is. Has anyone been in a situation like mine who is now knowledgeable and can give me some advice, pointers, anything to help me learn, figure out what app/site is best for someone like me and so on. I'm more than willing to support the efforts this sub is trying to accomplish, partly because yes I want to give myself more of a fighting chance in life and also kinda to stick it to the assholes who manipulate our financial system.    Thanks for reading and I know time is valuable so any time someone takes to help point a stranger in the right direction is incredibly appreciated.

We're too stupid to do that üòÅ  This is a classic scenario of telling someone they cant do something, in turn, making them want to do it more.

Is ACB a good alternative for people that can't get GME?
I am in Canada and GME is not available because of some stupid rule about showing my ID (which I know I have previously, and signed all docs for US trading).  BB is my baby but I swore to not play with that stock ever since I lost half in it when I worked for them (the shorts had complete control over the company back then).  I am thinking of buying ACB as it is another shorted stock, is that a good idea?  The Dank is a Musk favorite AND it is possible it will be legalized federally in the states... That is just potential for greatness... Or is it?  Please advice.

Robinhood blocked me from buying more GME. I went to eTrade and took an old IRA and put it all into GME. Let‚Äôs go!
Fuck Robinhood. To the moon we go!
It is time for a mass exodus from the platforms that bend over not for their users, but for their corporate sponsors.
Robinhood - The story goes that he stole from the rich and gave to the poor. Robinhood the platform appears to believe that the free market simply is not. It is a tool that the rich use to remain so by exploiting the masses. When they shut down the buy function, they are simply fucking us plebs.  Many platforms today including TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Etoro and of course Robinhood are restricting the option to purchase shares of notable meme stocks $GME, $NOK, $AMC, and $BB. These platforms are allowing institutional money to gain the upper hand on the masses by completely restricting our ability to fight the good fight. It is blatant market manipulation and should not be upheld. After your positions are in the clear, or transferable to another brokerage, make a new account and let these companies rot for what they have done.  Platforms currently restricting purchasing:  R
SoFi is allowing the purchase of GME, AMC, NOK!
If you want to thank them, you can buy a few shares of their stock:  IPOE (      They're a great buy if you do DD either way.     GME to moon! Holding the line!

I recently discovered about this whole Reddit taking Wall Street and rich fucks by the balls deal and holy shit I'm so proud of all of you guys (and in particular of u/DeepFuckingValue , rn you're probably saving and helping a lots of people's lives with this move), the Internet really can be a powerful tool sometimes. I would've loved to buy something too myself but my debit card loves the number zero on my balance so I guess it's a no-no  2020 was grim but 2021 seems to be full of hope for many right now  Keep it up, retards, you're making history   Cheers from Italy   üêµ
Today I pulled everything out of robinhood.
I hate having USD as an asset but I'll have to deal with it for a few days on principle. What's a good alternative for trading? HOLD, BOYS!
GME Is Going Down Badly. DO NOT SELL!
From 450 to 190 so far and keeps going down.. DO NOT SELL YOU FUCKERS!      \ I am not a financial adviser          (But dont sell)
My üìú  's. A cautionary tale...
I am relatively new here. I bought in on the dip a few days back and fell for the news of Melvin closing his position. I sold! My gains are dirty I want back in. The shame I feel today is unbearable. Fuck Robinhood! Give me my buy button!
Robinhood's actions today don't just affect investors.
I put $400 in my Robinhood account last year to learn the stock market since I couldn't work or leave the house. My mom needed a full time caretaker, and I'm the only child. I grew that money to $4000, and since she has since passed away recently (lost the house and all my savings I lived off last year), the gains I've had this past week on that $4,000 was going to let me pay off the truck that my dog and I are living in, AND take him to the skin specialist next week. Now, all of those gains are lost.  I literally gave up everything when my mom got sick, and now that people like me catch a break while a lot of us are applying for jobs, we get screwed. I've just lost faith in absolutely everything. I didn't want a second vacation home, a yacht, or my own plane. I just wanted to have just a little bit of light in my life while I try to move on with the next chapter of my life. I hope these crooks are proud.
This is  . Stay calm with this dip!
I fucked that up, but still
What is happening to GME?
Why is it constantly descending and then getting put on hold
IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED
GOOD LUCK,  DONT GO FULL REGARD AND HOLD THROUGH THIS.  ITS OVER GUYS.
What is happening to GME?? It tanked like a bitch today are we still holding?????
For those of us who don't have a lot of money to spare, should we honestly still hold GME at this point? Will it rebound?
Anyone else unable to buy AMC on WEBULL? ARE THEY GOING TO BLOCK US NEXT!?
I was unable to purchase new stocks with no current suspension. A message appeared mentioning the stock is un-tradable on WeBull.
Moment of Humanity among stock market chaos
I hope the mods don't delete this...   Idk any of you but I just want to say that it's touching to see us all working together, almost like a team, to buy a stock, because we like it, and also to fuck over the Wall Street big wigs that have been fucking people like us over for decades.   I've read a lot of stories many of you posted on here about how you were all hurt in the crash of '08, and how Wall Street greed and corruption has played a part in many of our lives, and this is our way of getting back at them. For many of us, its about the money. But for others, it's more personal. We don't care if we lose money, we just want revenge.   Anyway, we win together or we lose together. Its nice to know there's other people out there going through the same thing as you, who you can relate to, sharing your experience. I truly hope this works and ends well for all of us.   To the moon Brothers and sisters! Buy GME and AMC! Dont sell no matter what. The rich and powerful are trying to shut us down, strong-arm us, and beat us into submission. Every stock you sell is guaranteeing their success. Let's stick together and hold the line!    I don't give financial advice. I'm a professional dumbass
Operation Sheriff of Nottingham
Robinhood has proved itself unworthy of its name.  It is time the people summon the power of Robin Hood's nemesis the Sheriff of Nottingham  2 part action  1. Get everyone you know to signup for Robinhood. They get their free stock. As soon as you are able sell the stock and withdraw the money. Don't put any of their own money in.  2. We all withdraw our non GME and AMC money

My first post ever here. Hold the fucking line!!!
I am likely what you would call a boomer. Middle aged female new investor. Saw what was going down with GME and bought a few shares on Monday. Today, I bought even more, at   I am not selling. The market manipulation is incredible. I refuse to sell. Once those poor people from useless brokerages get their ducks in order(looking at you RH) we will force their hand. Do not sell, we can do this if we work together. I WILL NOT SELL!!

Crowd fund a public inquiry on Melvin?
Is it legal to crowd fund a investigation into Melvin Capitals financial records and their shorting on GME?  Could lawyers be hired to prove that Melvin‚Äôs and others actions lead to this?  There is true public interest in certain companies and we have diamond hands because we like this stock.
SoFi is still letting you buy
Where can I buy I want more GME tried to open a webull account it takes 2-3 days to verify, robinhood is fucking us I need more GME
That $200 trading right now is making me itch I need
Fuck RH, it‚Äôs probably time we move our tendies to a better brokerage. Recommendations on the best ones?
It‚Äôs a little ironic that a company named Robinhood would fuck over the little guys to help the rich, not gonna lie.
The Day Memes Took Over: End Of An Era for Hedge Funds [Fan-Fiction}
Gone are the days of charging exorbitant fees or commissions on shitty returns. No longer will we grovel at the knees of big funds for a measly 5% yearly return. It has been a long time coming, but sure enough, the weaponized autism of the internet has yet again come together to destroy a long-standing industry. It  started with just memes about stonks. Comedic in tone, but filled to the brim with community-based learning. We grew together, and we turned a bunch of Gen Z and Millennials into homebrewed Wolfs of Robinhood. Millions in gains and losses flooded the reddit forums by the day while the rest of the world slept. They scoffed at us and called us internet trolls, alt-right, and much much more. But how can you hurt a group of folks that identify themselves as degenerate retards? You cant. You only make them stronger.     Main stream media was so predictable in their reactions. They slandered and spread misinformation faster than they had ever done before. But all they know is political ad hominem attacks. HOW CAN YOU ATTACK A NON-POLITICAL GROUP OF MILLIONS?! YOU CANT!!! We have been subjected to shit-posts online for years. Reddit is to free speech now, like how Xbox Live Game Chat was to us in the early 2010s. We are used to this all. We embrace the hatred toward us and use it to foster love in the community, building our retard strength ten-fold.     Today we have begun the next phase of many that will come. Our beloved Robinhood. The place we called home for so long has taken a strong stand against us after everything we have done for them. Robinhood had attained the coveted Meme status and was on its way to being the app that set us free and sent us all to valhalla with papa Elon, Chamath and Cohen. This is no longer the case. We must not fret my brothers. We must win this short squeeze by continuing to play their sick game of Cat(with shotgun) and mouse.     WE ARE NOT THE MARKET MANIPULATORS HERE! We are playing a fair fight against the big boys. We are gaining so much ground faster than they had ever anticipated, much like boomers tend to do. HOLD STRONG! Have faith that our glorious leaders in fighting the Hedge Fund Billionaires soon-to-be-millionaires, as we hold LONG PAST THIS FRIDAY!     ABANDON ROBINHOOD?! That is something even I am debating. But we must not sell, and we must find ways to keep buying if your hands allow it. FOCUS ON GME ONLY! We must not abandon our strongest play.      In conclusion, I hope the SEC had fun reading this, and whatever other MSM shills. Praise be to the bag holders and supporters of this revolt. LETS SUE ROBINHOOD AND EXIT THEM INTO OBLIVION, THE SAME WAY THE SHORTS WILL VANISH TOO! They can keep trying to frame this to the boomers as if we are up to something illegal, or that we are foreign-influenced. But all that does is shine light on who is a sell-out hack with no credibility.      We. Will. Win.
WHERE ARE THE REINFORCEMENTS? I am holding but I need my brother's, remember: WE LIKE THE STOCK!
Don't fucking sell, no diamond hands for those who sell!
Power to the PEOPLE!

The shorts are trying to make you afraid by manipulating tickers with P&D
Have you ever wonder why suddenly AMC,NOK,BBBY which are non meme stocks on WSB and doesn't have much mentions are suddenly being promoted so heavily during the GME squeeze by MSM and citing we are squeezing the shorts? Even we are just aiming on GME?  If you notice NOK, AMC and BB got sudden spikes yesterday in price with GME despite only BB is a meme on WSB and was only mentioned frequently before the GME squeeze.   NOK,AMC,BBBY on the other hand is simply a P&D so that the MSM could say that we are squeezing stocks despite we only believe in GME and long BB  You should also look at the IB SLB rates,SLB rates are what interest rate short sellers needs to pay to short stocks.     If you notice, all stocks are not available for short sale despite you could easily do so on BB 2 days ago with 4 mil available for you to sell. But what interesting is that when robin hood and many brokers doesn't allow you to buy these tickers, the short interest rates suddenly spiked which means that there is some crazy shorting going on.   While GME interest rate goes down mainly due to being blocked by brokers to not allow you to buy the stocks but could only sell, which lessen some short sellers pressure.  so what should you do?  If you are all in just hold, the shorts will need to buy back eventually.  If you have the extra cash, buy the dip
I don't know about finances, if I buy gme stonks do I get rich?
Title
Cheat to win? Where is the inside info on this?
Did the hedge funds know this was about to happen yesterday? Did they drive the price up aftermarket in order to create an artificial void to short knowing no one could buy the dip? All so they could raise enough to buy their way out?  HOLD BULLY BOYS HOLD!!!

With all the powers that be that are working against us, if you are a big investor rooting for us WE NEED YOUR HELP. With Robinhood preventing us from buying more shares, please help us prevail if you believe in this cause.   I'm not asking you for the sake of making money but for the precident this sets moving forward. If you truly want to do some good in this world donate profits to a charitable cause. Let's make this world a better place. 2020 was a terrible year and I'm so sick of being spoon fed bullshit and living paycheck to paycheck. I want to see happiness prevail amongst everyone.

Message Subject: Unfair market manipulation   Message Text:   Hi, I am a concerned citizen (and military member) that is concerned over last couple of day's news in regards to brokerage firms restricting user's ability to place the trades they would like which currently includes companies like Gamestop, Blackberry and AMC Entertainment (  The brokerage firms Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers are the firms I am aware of that have restricted either sale or purchase of certain companies based on their perception of volatility and to "mitigate risk to customers". This is unacceptable in a free market. These companies have been pushed down to major lows based on short selling and manipulation. People who love these companies have banded together to stop the short selling and raise these stocks back to where we feel they belong and when these large, money rich firms got burned, all of a sudden the volatility is a problem. This is the very definition of market manipulation and I am asking that my representatives look into this and correct it. If the market is not truly free, as it has not been for many years, then only those with access to major wealth (much of which isn't even owned by these firms) will continue to trade in the market, and only these firms will be able to enrich themselves. Please look at this and take it seriously. I think that only legislative change can fix this injustice.   Very respectfully,   intellectually challenged individual.  Everyone do their   movement needs to keep going!

We also know that the squeeze has not been squozed because if all was lost they wouldn‚Äôt be pulling these manipulation tactics.

I‚Äôm gonna hold onto GME but what are some legitimate reasons why you think it will come back?
You guys need to realize that you only lose money if you sell. Everything else is a paper loss. Do not panic.
It's so easy, just hold!
We must hang in there and buy back up the moment it opens again.

HOLD STRONG BROTHERS ! 5 SHARES BOUGHT WITH FIDELITY AT THIS AMAZING STEAL
My confession üôèüèª
Forgive me u/DeepFuckingValue,  lord  and  savior,  for  I  have  sinned.  Today  I  acted  like  a  üìëü§≤üèº    and  was  punished  for  it.  I  hereby  confess  my  sins,  and  humbly  beg  for  your  forgiveness.  This  morning,  me  and  my  80  shares  were  strapped  into  the  magic  moon  rocket,  ready  for  liftoff.  And  THEN!  ‚Äì  minutes  before  markets  opened,  you  were  betrayed  from  within  your  ranks.  They  who  shall  not  be  named  (eternal  curses  be  upon  them!)  sabotaged  your  revolution,  trying  to  delay  the  inevitable  collapse  of  the  boomer  lords.  Chaos rocked my mind, and the premarket plummeted. The boomers had struck their blow. Fearing the magic moon rocket was delayed, I felt the situation called for a tactical retreat, so that I may regroup with you later for the counter attack. And so, as fate would have it, I shamefully sold half my shares @ $300 when the markets opened.  For this, I will be eternally sorry. My hands wereth made of the weakest papyrus from the most pathetic reaches of the kingdom. My faith faltered, but the crusade did not. The stock stabilized, and rallied. I see now the error of my ways, and pledge to you that the boomer lords can pry the remaining 40 shares from my dead, cold hands when the battle is over and we stand victorious. I am not selling, no matter what happens. Across the sea, we will try to hold the line until you are ready to rejoin us.  To the moon!

The GME dip is artificial, just look at the volume.
Throughout the week we have seen massive volume trading through GME, keeping the price relatively strong, however, if you look at charts today, you can clearly see the lack of volume in today's trade. While I am an autist, I can safely theorize that people are buying up the short sellers stocks at cheap prices, this is essentially a sale, so LOAD UP WHILE YOU CAN   TLDR FIRE SALE GME 10,000 PT

Where is Robinhood on all of this? Anyone heard anything from those punk ass bitches as to why they think it‚Äôs fine to restrict free trade and support crooked hedgefund interests?
Okay I'm pissed. I don't have any GME stocks anymore but I'm still pissed.
So PLUG goes to 30B that's fine. Raised   billion+ in cash that's fine. Literally all vaccines companies out there are up 2000x that's fine. But hedge fund shorted Gamestop and now TDA blocks AMC and GME. Robinhood blocks people from buying Gamestop. As a collective degenerate unit we decided to buy Gamestop. No inside trading.  /DeepfuckingValue and small players makes a lot of dough. Big players are losing money and can't get out... it is suddenly a problem.   Every news out there on cnbc is so full of shit. Money managers writing a whole load of shit articles. Why do they get a voice and we don't?  The rigged game were always in their favor.  What the fuck happens now? I'm just pissed cause I'm a broke ass degenerate that made some being in this group.
Put your legal briefs away retards
Yeah, I get it -- you're pissing vinegar because the man is out to get you and now you're starting petitions and filing class-action lawsuits etc.  You're not going to win because you have no standing and/or it's your own fault, let me save you some fees:    Robinhood  : you're sitting on your bike with training wheels wondering why they won't let you ride down the mountain.  Get a real broker instead of a 3rd party app.  They're not manipulating the market; they're trying to protect their stupid-ass users (you) from blowing up their accounts which WILL hurt their bottom line.  If you lose all your money on a GME swing you can't buy FDs next week; they don't want a lump-sum payment.    Any other brokerage  : they didn't restrict stock purchases or closing out existing options, just opening new option positions.  This isn't market manipulation, this is protecting their bottom line from mouth-breathers who don't understand impVol (1000%?  All in!!!) and don't want to be on the hook for a bunch of noob retard losses.  Have margin requirements gone up?  Damn straight; but so has the borrow rate.    CNBC  : they're not out to get you; they're not a collective intent on bringing down meme stocks any more than WSB is a collective intent on pumping meme stocks (see what I did there?).  If they report bad info, it's because that's the info they were provided (opinion pieces withstanding).  These are unprecedented times (well, at least in the past few years) and everyone's looking out for themselves, not trying to help Melvin and Citron (expect the other hedge funds).  This isn't market manipulation; it's fight-or-flight of the business world -- if you're too fragile to understand this or spread too thin to adjust, you probably should be sitting this out.

Note: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor this is not financial advice, etc etc etc
HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!
Non-Robinhood users: STEP UP
Obviously, a VERY large portion of GME shareholders trade through RH.  I, as with many others, were prepared to buy deeper into GME today, and now have funds stuck in RH‚Äôs buying power.  It will take time for us to transfer from RH, to the bank, to another investment site. We cannot buy ANY GME until this happens, and it is driving the price down, forcing more people to fall for this scare tactic market manipulation and sell.   not investment advice  Obligatory

Blocked on robin hood? Other traders are still open!
Maybe others can list the ones they use here, I have an existing trade account on Wells Fargo myself where I get free trades and they're still allowing GME trades, can grab them on the huge dip right now.  If you have an existing bank account with them it's pretty quick to set up and works right in your online banking.
Hold you beautiful bastards
What site/app should you buy stocks in?
After witnessing RobinHood's actions today, it seems only right that this subreddit redirects people to other trading sites/apps that are less likely to manipulate buyers (stopping buys from being possible, hiding stocks from search menus, etc.). I heard that Fidelity is a good alternative but I want to hear a clearer response from you all.  There is still a growing number of people who want to join in, and we need to help them feel secure in holding their stocks. We can only do this together.  DIAMONDS HANDS ONLY FORM UNDER IMMENSE HEAT AND PRESSURE. WE LIKE THE STOCK.
Let‚Äôs punish them for shorting cannabis!! $acb looks ready
What UK trading platforms are still allowing GME?
I am using trading 212 but like robinhood its shit the bed. Any immediate deposit ones allowing trade?
Fidelity is working - You can register and buy GME stonk in minutes
So do that
SSR Rule 201 on AMC and GME
Hey Team,  Can someone verify that SSR has been triggered or not?  How will SSR being triggered effect price action for both of these stocks tomorrow? Speculative.
Why I'm Holding $GME
It's not about the money anymore. Wall street clearly thinks they can just bend us over. They demonize us. They say we don't understand fundamentals. They try to destroy our community. And now, they target our trading platforms.    So go ahead. Try to create a panic selling scenario. I'll still be here. I bought into $GME not because of some ponzi scheme or because of some "coordinated attack", but because I, like many others here, saw the \ \ value\ \  in $GME. Like others, I could have sold for massive gains.    But now I'm not selling. The game is rigged, and many celebrities and icons are here with us. We are not alone. This isn't about the money, it is about the movement. And I don't care if I lose my entire $GME investment anymore. And Melvin, Citron, Citadel, Robinhood App, et al. are reading this - sincerely, fuck you.     \ Disclaimer: this is not financial advice. Do whatever you want with your money.\
DO NOT FALL FOR MARKET MANIPULATION: THOUGHTS AND SNACKS INSIDE
Following are my regarded theories:  1. Hedges do not like losing money 2. They are losing a fuckton of money every day because they are balls deep short dick inside GME 3. GME gets huge international attention with tons of newbs wanting a ticket to the moon   4. UK buyers get blocked from 212 yesterday. They start diversion   with both media and bot army to drum up NOK, BB, AMC which they are buying in tons to rocket them off. Retail gets excited about NOK BB AMC, gobbling them up. 5. Today GME is blocked from RH. Huge short sell attacks to drop the price 6. Hedges start to dump NOK, BB and AMC to create fear of universal crash, to make everyone panic sell GME.  I will be really jaded at the system after this. They do not give a fuck about the regular Joe, and everyone is willing to ally against YOU. We are under heavy attack right now.  FUCK THEM, FILE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, FILE A SEC COMPLAINT, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY:    DIAMOND   FUCKING   HANDS ü§≤ HOLD ü§≤    This is not financial advice. Do your own DD. SEC GO DO YOUR GODDAMN JOB
Hold and buy the dips!!! Don‚Äôt give up
There‚Äôs no better way to show them the power of the people. Right now they think they won. Robinhood and others have ceased trading thinking they‚Äôll drop it back. Don‚Äôt give in! They have NOT won. The squeeze is still coming.      boys!
Can and should WallStreetBets really create an investment fund?
Is that even legal?  I‚Äôd be willing to invest.   Probably with the millions of members it would have massive buying power, and I know there are some geniuses lurking into the muck here, with valuable DD and a deep understanding of market plays.  This could be a formidable financial alliance, ‚Äúof the people, for the people.‚Äù   Obviously it requires someone (probably a group of people) much smarter than me to organize it and make it happen. I guess this post is more to see how much support the idea would have.   The Average Joes can have as much leverage and market power as the hedge fund guys if we‚Äôre organized properly.

Fuck Robinhood for stopping buy orders. They‚Äôve shown me their true face. Lesson learned. I‚Äôm still holding, Robinhood, you bastard.
Fuck Robinhood and any other trading platforms that won‚Äôt let us buy and therefore drive the price down. They suck. Looking forward to moving my shares elsewhere.
Why does AMC keep getting suspended right when it starts to climb??

The Revolution Has Started. What side are you on?
Everyone thought that the next revolution in this country would be a political one. They were wrong.   Everyone thought that the government would be the one redistributing the wealth. They were wrong.  Everyone though we were sheep that will follow whatever the MSM tells us. They were wrong.  Welcome to the revolution.

What will the fallout from $GME look like?
Whenever this GME fervor dies down, what will the repercussions look like? Surely there will be no repercussions for the hedge funds, I'm certain it will all come down on us. So what kind of spanking are we in for?

File a complaint against Robinhood with the SEC. Instructions below.
If anyone would like to file a complaint against Robinhood, for their blatant attempt at manipulating the price of shares, here are some things you'll need to know in order to fill out the forms.   Go onto the page, and complete the form. If you chose to not send the information to RH, the SEC can't do anything to "help" other than log the complaint.   I'm so fed up with this crap. Let's do something about it.      Link to SEC complaint form        Robinhood Address   85 Willow Rd, Menlo Park, CA 94025
For everyone searching by new who wants to buy $GME you can buy on Fidelity
This is according to other users in the comments. You may have to use a wire transfer
So is this the time to start boycotting trading apps?
Like many I‚Äôm infuriated at the fact that I can‚Äôt freely trade (we all know what stocks). The fact big tech is putting the finger on the scale to stop the little guy is very telling.  I‚Äôm thinking about selling everything and closing the account.  Opinions?
Really?
I just wanted to pay off my debt!
ROBINHOOD CAN KISS MY ASS! FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD! I WAS BUYING GME THIS MORNING AND THEY CANCELLED MY ORDER! I'M BROKE AF AND NEED THE GAINS TO PAY OFF DEBT BUT ONLY THE BILLIONAIRES ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT! FUCKKKKKKKKK!!!!

To any newbies or those curious to a simple explanation of current market conditions
That link has a story of the biggest squeeze to happen in history until now. At the time investors shorted car companies. At the same time one of the companies was secretly bought out by Porshe. This tied up 99% of all the stock and created an "INFINITY SQUEEZE."   That is the real value of this stock right now. A bunch of idiots have shorted too much of the stock. This goes beyond what happen with VW since that wasn't as intentionally overboard as this short is. The VW short was an accident for the most part.  This is much more serious this time around. VW went from $6 to $900 with this simple mistake. This could easily be 10x worse with the potential for infinity.  That's why $1,000 isn't a meme and neither is $10,000. This sort of scenario has a historical case study from the link above. The real uninformed investors are the ones who didn't learn from this recent history and overplayed their hand to a degree of carelessness that should never be entertained after the 2008 fiasco. The real fools are these hedge funds who piled on a bad bet. They are the ones playing the casino and hoping that the house is asleep and uninformed. Because the truth is we are the house. We are the ones who fund the government. We don't get to dodge taxes because they instantly take it out of the pay check. We also have money in hand because the rich have most of their cash tied up in assets. They make their money peeling skin off of the giant that we are and try to fool us into thinking we're small.  I'll end with a quote: "I agree, the past is over."
GME is not a sinking ship, ITS A FUCKING ROCKET
TO THE MOOON BOYS  HOLD FOREVER       Position: 2 GME @ 66 (It ain't much but its honest work)
GME - Float hasn‚Äôt budged. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the price manipulation. Hold strong!
They‚Äôre trying to shake your resolve! Float is looking just fine. Don‚Äôt fall for their tricks - $1000 next stop!
This is actual fucking market manipulation, more like taking from the poor and giving to the rich, I‚Äôm disgusted.
Who‚Äôs going to lead this class action lawsuit?
Leaderless movements typically fail to execute their objectives and manage their members. It‚Äôs part of the reason why this subreddit is so easily vilified and why our intentions are misinterpreted.   Moving forward, how are we going to ensure that brokerages actually answer for their crimes? Who is going to spearhead this call for justice?
Hi, guys. Im new to the stock market! Any particular stocks you guys like? Thanks in advance!
I've got 324 dollars and am looking for an investment. What's your favorite stock?
Who Makes the Decision to STOP Buying?
I have no GME stocks, but have been willing people on to DO NOT SELL! But naturally if selling (closing) is the only option, then the price can only come down (unless nobody actually sells).  It got me thinking though...  With people unable to buy GME but only sell (close) shares, I want to know who actually makes this decision?  Also, is it legal?
E TRADE WILL LET YOU BUY GME GET YOUR TENDIES ON SALE
Halts... highly illegal!
I'm pretty sure these scum are halting at lows to scare ppl into selling and just now at a big buy jump they halted to stop the gains. People need to go to jail for this!!!
STOP SELLING!! WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU SELLING!!!! THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO!! THEY ARE MAKING YOU SCARED SO THAT YOU PANIC SELL!! FUCKING HOLD!!!!

Fidelity is allowing buying stocks that Robinhood blocking
I was just able to set up an account with Fidelity and buy some stocks that Robinhood wouldn‚Äôt allow me to buy.
I'm down with 200 shares $AMC several thousand (Was in at $16 yesterday) with #Corrupt Robinhood - HOLDING and BUYING THE DIP now on Cashapp. NOW THIS IS PODRACING
Never Give Up, Never Surrender, Fuck The System!!!
We must stay unified and fight!
Robinhood what a oxymoron!
Triterra inc is the only serious squeeze play that makes sense to me. They haven‚Äôt nerfed it yet.
I expected it from the hedge fund crowd and CNBC. Robinhood‚Äôs actions are a betrayal.
And I don‚Äôt even  use  Robinhood. Or whoever Robinhood‚Äôs nemesis   Sheriff of Nottingham? That‚Äôs probably what we should call them.   They are not working to bring market stability. They are protecting the top .01% of the top 1% of our society who are just trying to drive down prices by Friday.   They are not working to protect you. Protect you from what? Losing 30% on BB or AMC? When did any broker in history worry about you betting the wrong way? They don‚Äôt give a shit.   And they are not working to stave off a market collapse. If our market is dependent on naked short sellers then it probably SHOULD collapse.   Leave those hypocrites and enjoy the dip their actions created with a new broker. They are counting on you to get distracted and not engage in the effort.   And remember, these guys want to file for an IPO soon. They have a lot more to lose than you.

The Sho(r)t Heard Round the World
Restricting the ability to trade the stonks from r/wallstreetbets will only backfire on the hedge funds and elites attempting to stop it. Already open letters and class action lawsuits are being built up here.  Feels to me like this could be the shot heard round the world that could spark another Occupy-level of a movement.   Don‚Äôt let the bastards win.
It‚Äôs time to buy the dip $GME!!!

From UK: How Invest in $GME???
I‚Äôm finally deciding to hop on the rocket to fuck over those big business bastards, but robinhood‚Äôs not available in the UK. What‚Äôs the best alternative?
Hello there I‚Äôm new and kinda wondering what‚Äôs going on
So if I where to buy/invest stocks in GameStop in like the next 24 hours would I make money or something? Sorry, I‚Äôm just not really understanding what‚Äôs going on.
BlackBerry is still an undervalued tech stock with plenty of potential.
EXTREMELY UNDERVALUE  CYBERSECURITY, SELF DRIVING, AMAZON PARNERSHIP, BAIDU, PROJECT IVY  Warning: not a financial pro. Just a retard. This is not financial advice  But I like the stock!!!!!! Big PP move to buy/hold for longterm if you ask me.
What broker to use now?
Once the squeeze is over in GME and I feel comfortable moving my money I‚Äôm leaving both RH and TDA. What brokers would you recommend, always thought RH was on the side of retail but they have made it obvious they aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôll leave $5 in TDA so I can have their ‚Äúthink or swim‚Äù software as that was the main reason I was with them. What brokers haven‚Äôt stopped free market trading and don‚Äôt crash all the time because at this point that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for.
Sticking it to Robinhood?
What's the best way for me to stick it to RH,   hurting myself in the process. This is some serious BS today

$PTON to $200 on earnings?
Hey there,  Disclosure: Long time $PTON investor here, holding 800+ shares right now.   My 2c: People keep mentioning Peloton as a Covid-19 pandemic play but as a long time user I disagree and I think it has staying power. The stock has gained 400% over the past year, but I don't think the exercise-at-home business will decline once gyms open back up. I don't think I will ever rush back to a gym and I like being able to exercise on my own, and on my own schedule. I think Peloton is the start of a shift from gym to at-home that's going to be permanent.  I also believe the the price for the exercise bicycles will come down as well as the treadmills. Same for the $39 monthly exercise-video subscription as well. I think the acquisition of Precor means more devices in the future. Personally I am really hoping for a connected rowing machine. I also think all manufacturing issues will be solved with Precor part of Peloton now.  People are going to remain anxious to be together, even with a vaccine.     Peloton   Interactive, Inc. (Nasdaq: PTON) will release its second quarter fiscal 2021 results after the   stock market closes on Thursday, February 4, 2021.     What do you guys think of $PTON next week on earnings?

Where can I buy GME and BB?

You can transfer shares to another broker for a fee. Look at the message that's being sent - we won't put up with your bullshit.

Remember VW DIPPED MASSIVELY BEFORE THE SQUEEZE. DONT SELL, they want us scared, they need us scared. If we close tomorrow above 115 we nearly won.

GameStop was the most traded foreign stock in India this week
>MUMBAI (Reuters) - India‚Äôs small investors are snapping up shares of   retail investor favourite GameStop Corp, making the video game retailer the most traded stock on some Indian brokerages after anonymous social media posts fuelled a frenzied rally.  >This week, GameStop accounted for 19% of the trades on Vested Finance, an Indian investment firm that helps Indians buy or sell   stocks, and 15% of the trades on its rival Stockal, making it the most traded stock on both platforms.  GameStop was the   foreign stock in India, this is a global movement. While the volume is probably not as much as other economies due to restrictive foreign investment laws here, anything helping push up the price of GME is great.
Edward Jones can eat a fat one
Just got off the phone with my broker since RH is a piece of shit.  Apparently Edward Jones is also restricting $GME guys.  This is all a joke.  We, the people, are getting dicked down hard.  Hold the line!

THESE ARE ARTIFICIAL SELLS/DROPS! HOLD THE LINE!
What we are going through right now is all coordinated. We're in the final rounds of the dog fight. Take a close look at the charts and volume being traded. These are artificial drops and hedge funds are just trading with one another to make it appear like there is a massive sell-off.  Do not be fooled! The volume being traded is incredibly low for the price to actually drop like that. It is artificial.  They will rinse and repeat the strategies they are using to try and halt GME from trading as long as possible throughout the day. Combine this with the multiple platforms that are now blocking buying of GME, they are hoping retail investors panic and sell.  HOLD. THE. LINE.
Bought GME with Vanguard

Best Robinhood alternative that DOESN'T restrict trades when it hurts their hedge fund buddies?
Robinhood's recent stance against retail investors has, to put it lightly, rubbed me the wrong way. I have decided to close my account with them, but first I need to know where to go.  I'll admit, Robinhood has been a great experience. I like its simplicity, speed, and wide variety of investments (stonks, options, virtual coins). What have you guys been using that you like? How does it compare to Robinhood?  WE LIKE THE STOCK but WE CAN'T BUY THE STOCK!!!! PUT YOUR DIAMOND HANDS TO WORK  ü§≤
wish you all the luck from ISRAEl
We are coming to buy, our banks let us buy stocks from the US, wait for us. or sell and let us buy cheap :P
WE HOLD OR DIE!
Right the fat pigs and fat cats are fucken scared. They're using every trick in the playbook from restricting trades, media manipulation to pre/after hours trading. Right now this is a major battle we have to HOLD MY SOLDIERS!!

WE CAN WIN THIS. HOLD HOLD HOLD   fucking   you retards!

Censorship. Shame on you reddit
DON‚ÄôT SELL!! HOLD YOUR POSITIONS!
This isn‚Äôt over yet! Everything will be back up soon enough. Brokerage firms/apps can‚Äôt restrict new positions on public companies for too long. The underlying companies would undoubtedly sue them for the resulting billions in losses. They aren‚Äôt willing to risk that. Hold your positions!

When you get the chance, make Robinhood pay. If they lose users their IPO goes tits up
Not saying you should do it now if you use RH for a brokerage but if they all of a sudden lose millions of users leading up to their IPO that will absolutely fuck their sale price and make the banks offering their IPO think twice. FUCK them, WE have the power
Just bought BB
No idea wtf I'm doing, but I bought BB shares on 5:1 leverage   Noticed GME took a huge dip too but has frozen on my app. To the moon I guess?

Just remember the GME stock drop doesnt mean our revolution is failing. It only means GME   is going on sale! MAXIMIZE YOUR TENDIES  I am not a financial advisor

The system is against you if you are poor. No one cares about you at all. I feel like I have been cheated. I don't care about the money that is being lost. I feel bad because I lost it unfairly.   But I will hold till the end.

WE ARE EXPOSING DECADES OF CORRUPTION
This is the first time in history the broader public will truly see just how corrupt and greedy our financial system is.  It's up to us to expose these vile, greedy fucks for what they truly our.  If the people want to know why they'll never be rich, it's up to us to show them.  Robinhood, CNBC, Hedge Funds, the SEC - they all need to be exposed for the soulless cock-suckers they truly are.  Why should billionaires be raking in cash while everyone else is struggling to pay rent?  Fuck them.  Millions of eyes are on us now.  Let's show them what we've got.  Don't cower now, friends.  Brighter days for everyone are on the horizon.
Petition to get u/DeepFuckingValue on barstool with Dave Portnoy
we do not operate as an entity, we are individual investors sharing ideas. This is not financial advice and I can't stop licking windows, help    Whew. Now that's over, I think getting DFV on a barstool short would be some good publicity.   If he tells the world about  ü§≤ for no less than  , the   manipulation, we can get everyone to back the cause.

Vy Global Growth (VYGG): Low-risk investment in what could turn out to be Reddit (The Company)!!!
Hey All  This is my first post here. Been a regular over at the sub SPACs. You guys should definitely come over. Some good DD on SPACs which end up merging with some exciting companies, such as EV/renewable energy companies, and doubling in a day on occasion, all with very minimal downside risk.  I've known about this sub for a while, but I've decided to write my first post after what happened to GME which is all over the place. That is the craziest shit I've ever seen, you guys are nuts! Congrats to all those who printed alot of tendies.  On to our topic for the day. First off, for those of you autists (yeah I speak the language) who do not know, a SPAC is a shell company with no operations and which raises money through IPO. It then looks for a company it decides to merge with. If both sides can strike a deal, the money raised through the SPAC is given to the target company in exchange for part ownership in that company, meaning the holders of the SPAC's shares become shareholders of the acquired company once the deal goes through. Simple enough.  Now I believe there is a good chance that Vy Global Growth, a SPAC that IPO'd late September 2020, is likely to eventually merge with Reddit, thereby turning VYGG's shares into shares of Reddit.  Of course this is not a sure thing (nothing is when it comes to markets), but the below reasons lend support to this likely outcome:  1- Reddit CEO Steve Huffman: The Company will consider going public in the future. Source:    2- Guess who's one of the directors in Vy Global Growth. From VYGG's prospectus:  " Steve Huffman will serve as one of our directors following the completion of this offering. Mr. Huffman is the Co-Founder, Director and CEO of Reddit, the ‚Äúfront page of the internet‚Äù and the sixth most visited site in the  "  3- SPAC sponsors generally provide an indication as to the industries they are targeting. From the prospectus: "We are a newly formed blank check company that intends to partner with a technology business that will benefit from our global expertise to define the future of its industry."  4- Vy Global Growth indicates that it prefers "Founder-led companies" (sound familar?). From the prospectus: " We look for businesses that are founder-led with a long-term vision." Reddit is of course founded and currently led by none other than our Steve Huffman.  5- Link between VY Capital and Reddit: Vy Capital funded Reddit in a recent round (  it owns part of it). That gives it preferential treatment in case it wanted to take it public through an associated vehicle. Source:    6- Vy Global Growth indicated it is not prohibited from acquiring a stake in a company affiliated with Vy Capital. From the prospectus: "We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Vy Capital." Why would they include such a clause? Probably intend to exercise their right as per this clause?  As you can see, loads of datapoints supporting the possibility that VYGG is likely to end up merging with Reddit. As I write this, VYGG shares are at $11, indicating a maximum possible loss of $1 (since VYGG is currently nothing but a pile of cash with $10 of cash per share). This is how the most risk averse person should think of the downside here, though the actual downside is probably $  per share based on how its been trading since it IPO'd.  The upside? If we get lucky and it does end up taking Reddit public? Easily $20 on day 1, and higher afterwards    .  This (along with several other SPACs I currently own) offer some of the best risk-reward setups I've ever seen in my life.  Let me know what you guys think.
really put the 'rob' in robinhood
A WallStreetBets anthem
We will not be silenced. Pls everyone affected we need to leave robinhood, class action, as well as file complaints with the SEC. We need to make as much noise as possible.
Also we should leave RH and move elsewhere. TOS, fidelity, webull, anything else.  Follow link to file complaint and good luck out there boys.

Im typing this as AMC and GME are plummeting.  You have to realize, WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.  They are terrified of what we have done. They are doing everything they can to scare the noobies off.  If we want to win this, we NEED STRONG HANDS.  If you cave in and sell, they can cover their shorts and we've lost.  They have been doing this for decades making billions leaving nothing for us.  WE ARE THE RESISTANCE  WE MUST STAY TOGETHER AS ONE  DONT LET THEM SCARE YOU

Wikipedia article is up already
That was quick. Rule #1 for an event to be historical is for said event to get a Wikipedia article with multiple sections, more than a page long.  Anyway, I'm 19, and I have never before been involved in stock trading. But what I saw last night (and as my understanding of the events rose) tells me that this community is extremely dedicated and has a very large amount of potential.  I'm 19 and have never involved myself in stock trading before. Perhaps this ship has sailed (if only I could have bought even just $100 of GME several days ago, just to see what I'd get), but nevertheless I just want to congratulate all of you on managing to flip some really big and important tables - especially u/deepfuckingvalue for having the foresight to start this.  Flaired as discussion because that's the closest to what this post is.
So who is buying? THE HEDGEFUNDS
You can only sell on various brokers. There is simply no way to "buy". But who are you selling to? Not the average Joe.  THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S THE HEDGEFUNDS BUYING SO THEY CAN REPAY THEIR LOANS.  HOLD APES. No selling means no cheap loan payoff.
THEY'RE CLOSING WHEN IT'S LOW TO SCARE US. DO NOT BE INTIMIDATED. BUY NOW IT'S LOW AND HOLD.

Which brokers are NOT actively screwing their customers today with this sell-only nonsense?
Clearly Robin Hood is trying to force people to sell at a loss instead of dollar-cost-averaging to capitalize on dips (if no one can buy, the price can only go down).  I was planning to move to a different brokerage, but have at least one source telling me they're pulling the same scam.  Which broker are known to NOT be screwing their customers that way? Bonus points if you can add whether or not they let you opt out of renting your shares out.

Guys, I'm sorry. GME's collapse is my fault.
I held out on buying any GME. Yesterday before close, I finally took the bait and went bawlz deep, KNOWING I would single-handedly crash the market (I usually buy high, sell low). I'm so sorry, I should've gave y'all a warning. Good luck.
Take a look at this VW squeeze chart and tell me where you think we are. BUY THE DIP. HOLD. HOOOOOOLLLLDDDDD.
Time to Leave Robinhood
Since it's basically the Fisher Price of trading apps ("You think it's going up? You should buy a CALL OPTION sweetie!") it was always going to cave when hedge funds said so.  I have no dog in the fight but I've been on Interactive Brokers for 5 years and they're great. Yes, it's a bit less Apple and a bit more Microsoft in their app design, but way way way more thorough and powerful.  Anyway, I'll post a screenshot of GME appearing on Interactive Brokers search. You know what to do.  TL;DR: Fuck Robinhood. Move to IB.
Mm only want one thing and its fucking disgusting
What is happening with GME is disgusting
Never have I ever seen a more "1% screws over the 99%" scenario. Robinhood and ALL the international brokerages that prevent you from buying GME should be sued.
Any lawyers here? Robinhood class action
We all know this isn‚Äôt legal, and we need a lawyer to file a class action lawsuit to recover all the funds people are about to lose due to market manipulation and brokers fucking people over.

Hello All  Well looks like everyone is in for a long haul, in between the adrenaline rush a word of caution when you ultimately sell the shares it will fall as fast and you know all these free apps or even big trading platforms will then go to buffer unable to process all orders and definitely problems will arise so please follow STOP LOSS People and as always don't go to Debt for this especially latecomers .

A message from a Latin American
Maybe this is the first time I felt that I'm not alone. That I'm not the only one who thinks that this whole game is rigged and that the elites have no decency in order to keep winning over the people.  I'm from Brazil, and a big part of my country history is dictated on the elites playing a casino game with people's jobs and lives.  In the 80's, while many of my family was barely having money to eat due to hyperinflation and economical instability, the 1% was making money out of it betting on starvation and death.  We, from the 3rd world, have our lives sold or bought by the giants who owns the machine and always won . When something put that in risk, they manipulate our market, our politics, our history.  We might disagree on how we deal with this. But the fact that many other recognize how dirty and immoral is all of that put a smile on my face. You guys made me think of what strategies and acts are relevant in order to make our voices loud and clear.  Maybe I can learn something different with you, and I'm happy if we can make you learn something different with us.  I hope you guys don't see this post as propaganda, this is just a vent from someone who is genuinely impressed of what is going on!   GME TO THE MOON
Freetrade community newsletter honey - misinformation?
Here's a snippet from the latest Freetrade (large UK trading app). Surely this is misinformation and trying to manipulate retail investors? :   What we‚Äôre seeing is a frenzy of buying in certain stocks, with people hoping to get rich quick.¬†  This is being sold as an attack on the suits at the hedge funds and other Wall Street firms. That‚Äôs partly true as some of them do seem to be losing a truck load of money.  But it‚Äôs mainly a case of greater fool theory at play.¬†  This is where people buy something in the hope that it will go up and then they can pass it on to the next person - or ‚Äòfool‚Äô - who is buying into the hype to try and get rich.  That‚Äôs what makes all of this so dangerous. There are no real fundamentals or metrics here that are driving the price of these shares upwards. People are just buying them and hoping that more people will buy in to push the price up, so they can then sell off at a profit.  The danger is that eventually people start to realise the shares they‚Äôre holding aren‚Äôt worth even close to the current price. When that happens, there is likely to be a huge, panic-driven sell off that pushes the price of those assets down.¬†  For those that are lucky enough to get out in time, there are gains to be made. But for huge numbers of people it can result in massive losses.¬†  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs generally better to avoid¬†these sorts of pile-ins. It can be tempting to think that quick, short-term gains are how you make money in the markets.  The reality is that it can often lead to you getting burned, while long-term investors, looking for consistent gains, will win out over a prolonged period of time.
Guys what happened?
We need to NOT sell!!
Look familiar? This is their last dying breath
DON‚ÄôT BE A PUSSY, GRAB YOUR DICK AND HOLD
Diamond hands
Looks like E TRADE stopped GME trading
If you haven't gotten in on this yet, NOW is the time to buy
I am not a financial advisor,   stocks are only dipping right now because the hedge funds are selling to each other to give the illusion of a massive sell-off, combined with trading apps restricting the trades for regular people. But as people find other apps to buy on and keep buying and holding, the stocks will soar back up.  DO NOT BACK DOWN, WE HAVE THEM ON THE ROPES. WHEN THERE IS A DIP YOU BUY!
Lmao you Autist lost
Idk how you thought you could get away with it, but you really tried, and I have to commend the courage. You guys really should have know it was over when the the president said their would be probes, I hope you guys don‚Äôt get in any trouble though for real
Duck CSE and TD. Quit covering for the duck heads and let them get what they deserve.

Stay strong, the sky is close!
I sold ALL my stocks. I refuse to play a rigged game.
FUCK THIS MARKET. NVDA? Thought I'd be holding it for years. MDT? I loved what they were doing with medical robotics, but I can't in good conscience hold the stocks. All the other tickers too except for some bullshit positions in OTC markets that I just can't bother with and that don't matter anyway.  As of right now Im 99% CASH.  FUCK THIS MARKET.
So Wall Street is Allowed to just use cheat codes at this point?
Make no mistake about it. This is fucking cheating. This has never happened before. Even if the SEC put the stock on hold for 10 days it would still affect everyone. This only affects us. The hedge funds can still buy, we can still sell. Robinhood has created a direct line for us to get absolutely fucked and closed everything else. This isn't "protecting users from volatility". It's fucking us and tanking our positions with malicious intent. My portfolio has dropped 50% In an hour and a half.   I knew the risks. I accepted the risks. I was ok with the risks. But I didn't calculate the possibility of cheating and blatant fraud from people who are so rich they know they can get away with it.
When this shit is over we are gonna reward those holding...
We wont let them get away with this...
GO BUY THE DIP! ITS AT 153! Join the rocket, we are going to 1K!

Where to go from here?
Keep riding the high and keep fighting the good fight! But what‚Äôs next? Can we use our man-power as a way to redistribute the wealth from those disgusting hedge fund ghouls? The regular person making money in the market is not an enemy, the real enemies are on Wall Street and this is the closest I‚Äôve ever seen to class consciousness. We need to organize and stick it to them.
Halt every 5 second?
How can they continue to halt and unhalt minutely and drive the price back so hard? Yall got your diamonds in hand?

Robinhood stopped trading GME and the stock is going down. While the hedge fonds are probably now able to make a huge amount of money. So, time to talk about Cryptocurrencies/DLTs, in order to get rid of this corrupt and manipulative system.
üí∞üëë‚ú® Congratulations Everyone, We Won ‚ú®üëëüí∞
Stop selling you donkeys  ü§ö
GME Down to 150. Cant wait to buy once RH realizes it‚Äôs on the wrong side of history.
I still believe
Since no one can buy right now, you'll be forced to sell at a much lower price, SO DONT SELL, there's more juice to squeeze.
BB is getting f cked! BUY ON DIP!!!       (Not an advisor)
This is BEYOND anything we imagined, but REMEMBER they will do anything to beat us. This is their strategy!
Chances are Robinhood got hit with a lawsuit, which is why they are not allowing people to purchase our stocks. Hold the line people. They're trying to defeat us, but they'll have to try much harder than this. If you sold, I urge you to PLEASE buy again and HOLD. Your paper hands will be forgiven this once because, and I'm not gonna lie, this was all part of their strategy and it is SCARY. We're running a marathon here people! Let's pick up where we left off. With DIAMOND FREAKING HANDS.
These sneaky fuckers performed well for their masters
At every turn they seek to exclude the people from participation. Robinhood is just the last example. Once glimpse at what the people are capable of when they work together is enough for them to race to rig the market even more.    " The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was political centralisation. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one national  class-interest, one frontier, and one customs-tariff.  " - Marx     They will never, ever, let the people gain even a taste of true power and wealth. Fuck this shit
i don't have much, but i threw $20 toward AMC because fuck these hedge fund elites
haven't done much with stocks & it's okay if i lose that $20 but i want in on fucking these wall street goons over. power to the people!

We are here. This is your LAST CHANCE before $GME takes off. Be on the right side of history
THE GME THREAD IS GONE
What is going on???
Nothing will beat one day saying that I not only HOLD - but I can be buried with my share
After a frantic night of jumping in at the deep end of this unprecedented, and stone-cold fantastic, moment in all of our lives, I managed to get in and buy 25 shares of   GME  , and I was staggered to have hit the morning dip at   \~300 . But this isn't about that. (Emojis will be scarce here!)     Its about share number   23  .  Share number 23  represents my family. It represents the home I grew up in and the things that I was taught to matter. It's not a lucky number so much as a number that always makes me think on the bigger picture and on what life is about. The other 24 shares are cool and all, but they can rise and fall and do what may, I didn't buy for profits.     So share number 23 will never be sold. Ever. NOT EVER. Not when the stock is cruising to the moons of Jupiter, not when the world is all a hologram, not when there is no longer a GME in existence and the universe is gone. 23 belongs to this moment.     The reason is spite, or pride, call it what you want, and perhaps needing to keep some piece of this moment. I have never been rich, and I don't want to be. I saw the crash in 2008 and I saw everyone on Wall Street get on with their lives as normal. I had enough money to get in this morning and know that I don't give a flying feck if the stock does anything. I've managed to 'bootstrap' myself up from the spot I was born into, so let it ride!     We all want to be Batman, but it feels nice to be the Joker, to watch something burn and tell everyone  "it's not about the money" . Because that's what THEY always cared about, it's why the world is unjust and unbalanced and selfish and greedy. We were born into a machine that had been up and running for centuries. It doesn't have any deserve to improve people, society, or human achievement. It makes money and judges us all on that metric for our entire lives. To paraphrase Batman:   "Money is the weapon of the enemy. We do not need it. We will not use it."      A collective effort to push back against the hollow, greedy, individualistic society that keeps us down? Take my money. I'm paying a ticket to watch a lesson play out, a lesson they thought they would never have to learn. That people matter. Not profits. That you can't rig the game forever.  That some things are more important than money.      When 20 years have passed. I'll be holding share number 23. If I can I'll pass it on with the lessons we are seeing here. The priceless lessons. Hold. Go to the moon. Do whatever you crazy brilliant heroes want. I'm happy to be here. Happy to hold and do the same.     But I am satisfied for life: we said 'no more'. We said things should be better.   Could   be better.     Share Number 23 lives by the poetry of Muhammad Ali:  Me? We!
THE HEDGES WANT YOU TO SELL, DO NOT DO IT KEEP HOLDING, THIS ALL FALLS APART IF YOU CAVE AND SELL
oh yeah was I supposed to write not financial advice I only like the stock a lot and 2 shares @ 297
Is this a class war?
As we know most folk are not millionaires with millionaire/billionaire friends who they can borrow off. They have access to capital and friends that far exceed what we could potentially do. They keep halting buying and selling of GME. Is this how they keep us poor?
WE HOLD THE STOCK WE HOLD THE STOCK WE HOLD THE STOCK WE HOLD THE STOCK
THIS IS FINANCIAL WAR. The billionaires think they can win. Don't let them!
The billionaires have tanks, but you can only kill so many people with a tank. Sheer numbers still can and will overwhelm.  We like the stock. Hold the line, and don't let the billionaires fuck us. This is our time to take back control. It's no longer about memes, it's about taking back our society by  liking the fucking stock .
Supporting you from the other side of the globe!
I'm a Xennial or whatever we are called and after graduating during the recession the only decent work I could find that might allow me to not be poor my whole life was working on the other side of the planet. I live in Shanghai and my retirement plan is hoping something is left when my parents pass on, sadly. I was able to get one stock of GME and 4 of AMC. I support y'all and hope i make some extra money from the other side of the world. Going to bed now, please hold strong!
Massive dip before VW squeeze. Hold the line.
GME DIP MARKET MANIPULATION! DON'T SELL! HOLD! AFTER DIP BIG SPIKE! BUY THE DIP!            $GME  ü§ö ü§ö ü§ö

THE DROP IS MANIPULATION DO NOT FUCKING SELL
The trade volume is to low. and when the shorts cover the price rises. DO NOT FUCKING SELL YOU DIAMOND HANDED GODS YOU FUCKING HOLD AND DO NOT FALL FOR THIS BULLSHIT!
What just happened
Can someone explain what the hell has just happened to GME AMC and BB‚Äôs price
$GME Power To The Players
Don‚Äôt sell a single share boys and girls. GME has no where to go but up when we hold. They have our new Slogan - Power To The Players.
ALERT!!! Must Read!!! You can buy on Cash App
Right now you can buy shares of AMC and NOK on Cash App. They don‚Äôt offer GME or BB, but we can still push the others. Hold the line! Together apes are strong! Upvote to let the people know. (This is not financial advice, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor)
Don‚Äôt let them win
These fucks think they can break us??? They think we‚Äôre shifting our pants with these dips??? Do they not understand who they‚Äôre dealing with?! Fuck Robinhood and TD and whatever bitch ass brokerage that decided to go against the people. Together we stand, divided we fall. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!
Buying the Dip! Canadians to the Rescue!

My dad is working on this aswell
My dad knows quite a bit about stocks and tell me the plan and ill inform my dad about it, he wants to help.
Personal opinion: they are restricting trades on GME to buy time for hedges/lenders to buy shares to cover their shorts. When they have enough to cover the shorts, Robinhood, etc. will reverse their decision and say sorry about that...   already took off though, and lost trust forever.
Anyone else?
For whatever reason (can't  possibly  imagine what that reason may be...) I can't seem to be able to register with any site other than RobinHood, which we have established sucks greasy donkey balls because they shut down stocks as soon as they gain any value.   E-Trade is flat out not letting me register, and webull is saying it will take 1-2 business days to process my application. Anyone else having similar issues, as though they are trying to deter you from registration?
HOLD THE LINE
don‚Äôt sell GME, this is the hedgefunds trading amongst themselves at lower prices to scare us into selling, if we hold, or better yet keep buying, we‚Äôll be able to do this
Do not sell!!!!! ROBINHOOD restriction does not mean to sell!!! HOLD HOLD!!!!
Do not sell!!!!! ROBINHOOD restriction does not mean to sell!!! HOLD HOLD!!!!     Do not sell!!!!! ROBINHOOD restriction does not mean to sell!!! HOLD  HOLD!!!!
WHEN THIS BOUNCES BACK IT WILL BE GLORIOUS
I cannot wait for the massive jump back up after they fail to shake us with their dip - halt - dip - halt spam they're doing.
Robinhood market manipulation lawsuit
Obligatory not a lawyer here. But it would seem that Robin Hood and by association citadel just massively screwed themself by making us unable to buy GME, BB, AMC and other stocks.  Now if we lose money on any of the stocks they closed us out of, then we should be able to sue for how much we would have when does the stock was at its max value. This is because they manipulate the market and directly cost us money.  If anyone sues them and wins that would set a precedent that should allow everyone else to win as well.
Has etoro sold out? It says the market for GME is closed?
I've no idea how this works it's my first time trading. But I'm on etoro and it says the market is closed for GME, does this mean that they done a RobbinHood? Any advice appreciated.      (mandatory rockets)
Boys I got a problem
Robinhood restricted game stop trading. Wtf do I do? Advice?
This is their hail mary
They know that whatever fines they face for manipulating the market like this are nothing compared to the money that they stand to lose if they can't force the price down.  This is them pulling all the stops. Blatantly breaking the law, because just like last time in 2008 where they got caught with their dick in the cookie jar, they know that they can buy their way out afterwards. All they want to do is scare you as much as possible to cover their own asses.  Ignore them. Hold. Every single person who was watching saw this coming. We knew they would cheat, we knew they would use fear tactics. This is the same thing that they have always done.   Hold. Do not let them get away with it. At least that's my take on it, as someone who is just a normal dude with little to lose on this.
GME
Hold your bets, wait them out. If you couldn‚Äôt get in earlier now is the time. Artificial drops are trying to scare us. Hold.
Don‚Äôt sell hold! Hold!
Why?
You guys literally fucked many of people out their money and I‚Äôll be getting you guys shut down
Bough more BB from Spain!
We support you from Europe fellow retards!  Im putting my mensual invest here!
I just want to say, I am so fucking proud to be here.
What an honor to be a part of this movement. It isn‚Äôt about how much we as individuals lose or gain anymore, this is we the people vs the corrupt elite. I am so proud to stand with you, diamond hands on hands. We are tiny, but we are mighty! I wouldn‚Äôt rather fly to the moon with anyone else.  You people are my people.
We shall not be stopped AMC to $100 GME to $1000 switch to fidelity today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not only im not selling, I‚Äôm no longer trading with Robin Hood. Im Holding, its all or nothing for me. But after this is over I‚Äôm moving EVERYTHING to other trading apps and closing my RH account.

Be the rat my brothers and sisters. SHRED THEM.
INDIANS GOT NO RESTRICTIONS AS WELL! BUYING MORE GME!
Fuck corporate hedge funds
Honest question, I love what you all are doing and fully support the short squeeze, but what is the long term goal?
Genuinely curious, what happens when people can't afford to keep buying and pushing the price of targeted stocks up? Those in WSB who bought high will presumably want their money back at some point, I imagine most people can't afford to leave their investments in the targeted stocks for decades. If the plan is to just keep buying, then it feels like a pyramid scheme, those who bought in early need more buyers to avoid a loss. Not trying to be a backseat driver because I'm not active on WSB, but it seem the initial squeeze of 10X would have accomplished it's goal to fuck the hege funds, but pushing above seems to only leave the WSB community at risk of serious losses when people eventually start selling.   Again, I'm all-in on using the power of the little guy to take on the wall street cunts, but it seems there is an obvious issue with fostering a bubble.
STOP SELLING APE STRONG TOGETHER
STOP SELLING APE STRONG TOGETHER
TRADING FIRMS RISK TOLERANCE
SINCE WHEN DOES AN APP, BUSINESS, OR ALL OF FUCKING ABOVE GET TO TELL ME WHAT MY RISK TOLERANCE IS.  IT IS MY TOLERANCE NOT THE COMPANY I AM TRADING WITH. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE - IM FILING EVERY SINGLE FUCKING COMPLAINT AND LAWYERING UP.  IF I WANT TO BUY A STOCK IM GOING TO BUY A STOCK - IF I WANT TO GO TO A CASINO I WILL GO TO A CASINO. THIS IS MY CHOICE AND WHAT IS OCCURRING ACROSS NUMEROUS PLATFORMS IS AN INHERENT HINDERANCE ON MY RIGHTS AND THE ‚ÄúFAIR AND FREE‚Äù MARKET.
Fellow   the rockets must come down let them be nukes. HOLD
Fellow piss üî´üî´drinkers, as longtime dumbass and first time forum poster, I ask please HOLD. If they will force the rocket   down let them know it comes with a nuclear payload. If there is something every retard here can get behind is a huge load. STAY STRONG!!!!!
I DON'T CARE, THIS IS PERSONAL.
It's been a lot of fun watching people talk rockets and diamonds, and when I initially got on the train it was about making money AND sticking it to the suits.   I spent 4 years being depressed and broke trying to chase a dream of making my first game where the total production value was under $30,000. Money these people wouldn't even bat an eye lash at. I wasn't even able to buy new clothes. Now I've put aside some money since its release and I went in half on this. I'm angry, my day is about to start and I'm losing money, all the apps are literally gating us from succeeding, and I've decided I don't care. If I come back and I have nothing I don't care, I don't want to be that person who caves and continues to let them do what they do. If they are going to do it anyway I'd rather take a stand.   I'm so angry that they can just do this and block our buys. I. AM. ALL. IN. BROTHERS. I know there's a bunch of paper hands panicking out there but I WILL NOT, when I went into this it's because I understood as I grown person this might not play out the way I wanted, SO BE IT, I'm not going to walk away wounded at a loss.  I'M NOT GIVING OUT OR DROPPING OUT!!!!!!!
If retail can only sell, then who is buying your shares/calls? That‚Äôs right, THE INSTITUTIONS ARE BUYING THEM.
DON‚ÄôT LET THEM STEAL THE FUTURE MONEY-MAKING OPPORTUNITY FROM YOU!   Hold until this all blows over and normal trading resumes.  I‚Äôve never been more enraged by the people at the top than I am right now.  Positions: NOK & SPCE LEAPS.
HOLD
Who said it would be easy?? You think the elite are just gonna roll around and let us bust them? We got them by the balls and they are cheating to claw their way back. Don‚Äôt mistake this for a sell off it‚Äôs all synthetic selling and buying to make the algorithms go down. GME WILL SHORT SQUEEZE JUST HOLD AND BUY. We got the whole world against us. The billionaires, OUR OWN BROKERS. It‚Äôs just us against the world and there will never be another fight like this. Diamond hands until the end retards. We are going to the moon with or without you.
Don't use Revolut, they won't let you buy
Order is stuck "processing", the cancel order button appears to work but does nothing, their status check shows problems with stock trading and customer support, basically they're sitting on my money and won't give it back

I feel like I have been violated, my $40 is now only worth $20.

Petition to stop any screenshots of trades/wins made on robinhood.
When this is all over, we should literally stop users from submitting any posts where they're trading through Robinhood. Fidelity, webull, anyone can stay accept these backstabbing bastards.
Stop Selling
For the love of god don‚Äôt panic, you are letting them cover
LISTEN! DONT SELL, HERES WHY!
GME might be down, but it won‚Äôt be down for long. They are censoring us, and the hedge fund are taking it over as we scramble to find places to trade, but they won‚Äôt have control fo long. IM DOWN $250 BUT IM STILL HOLDING, THIS ISNT OVER, REMEMBER THE CALLS THAT ARE EXERCISED TOMORROW. WE WILL BE UP NEXT WEEK!
Down 10k and holding, you can too
There‚Äôs a reason why they‚Äôre only giving you the SELL button!!! Do not hit the ejection button!!! We‚Äôre going to the moon
Holding AMC longterm, I'm not going anywhere.

Moving forward from Robinhood
I'm not the first to say that what Robinhood is doing to traders is disgusting and probably illegal.  I would like to say thank you to the diamond     that have kept their shares through the expect volatility of today and tomorrow.  Once a lot of you WSB users close your positions/ shares in Robinhood, where do we go? This should be a learning experience for us and them. 1. WSB will not tolerate blatant market manipulation through bullying by from big businesses & 2. We can always find another investment platform to use that's not tied to HFs and Wall Street.  Thoughts? This needs to be discussed.
Worst mistake of my life - cutting my losses and selling
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!
NOW is the time to buy.   Buying all the way down and all the way back up!
You can still use Webull to buy/sell some of the positions that RH won‚Äôt allow. Couldn‚Äôt buy AMC contracts, but I‚Äôm loading up on Nokia. Haven‚Äôt tested anything else yet.
HOLD GME
I thought we were supposed to hold this shit but all of you pussies are selling? tf  I just like the fucking stock!
Uhhhh... to the moon?
üò∞
I‚Äôm holding till the bitter end. But can we really recover from this?
It just keeps tanking. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, can someone with a bit of knowledge explain how there‚Äôs a way back from this so the newbies hold fast?
There are   Degenerates in WSB what is stopping us opening our own brokerage service and fuck RH now and forever
Yall dumb af if you sell today

What is Order Routing, why there is a conflict of interest between Robinhood, Schwab, Citadel and Melvin Capital
Robinhood and Schwab have a conflict of interest due to using Citadel for Order Routing, while Citadel is investing in Melvin Capital to help them weather the short squeeze.  It is a conflict of interest for Citadel to be routing orders for GME, and by Robinhood and Schwab stopping new orders for GME and AMC, they've likely broken their fiduciary duty.  The SEC should investigate why new orders were stopped.    Order Routing   >Order routing is the process by which an order goes from the end user to an exchange. An order may go directly to the exchange from the customer, or it may go first to a broker who then routes the order to the exchange.  >"Smart" order routing attempts to achieve best execution of trades while minimizing market impact. It is designed to help firms in an increasingly fragmented market to search for hidden liquidity, find opportunities in dark pools and use algorithms to maximize results without moving the market.  >In stock trading, it is a common practice among brokerage firms to route orders to certain market makers, who then "rebate" 1 to 4 cents per share back to the brokerage firm in exchange for the directed order flow. This practice is known as "payment for order flow" (PFOF).  Source:       Schwab's disclosure   >As part of a common industry practice known as Payment for Order Flow, Schwab receives rebates from liquidity providers and certain exchanges based upon the order flow executed at each destination. Some orders require us to pay associated transaction costs, but most orders result in rebates. Net rebates received by Schwab are used to offset transaction and order processing or handling costs and help us maintain very low commission rates for our clients. Rebate rates are substantially similar among the various securities exchanges and liquidity providers, although they vary based upon order characteristics ( , marketable vs. non-marketable).  >At Schwab we put our clients' interests first. Therefore, best execution for our clients always takes priority when determining where to route orders. Any eligible rebates from a particular market center are not a consideration in order routing decisions.

They totally conspired against us. Now they will say, ‚Äòsee we told you so‚Äô, when in fact they rigged the game. Robinhood needs to go bankrupt.
Help me help you
I have a large sum of money that I'm willing to put into GME. I don't care if I lose it. I intend to HOLD to stick it to the hedge fund assholes. I have never traded stocks before, all I've done is some paper trading on an app called Best Brokers, with some success.  I'm trying to sign up for Robinhood, but it doesn't work, and I heard that they're blocking people from buying GME. I'm trying to sign up for Webull, it doesn't work. Both websites just keep loading.   How do I buy GME stock as fast as possible?   (I'm currently in a Western European country, not sure if that matters.)
Just bought 5 shares each of KODK, UONE and GNUS
Decided to jump on this train. Am I doing it right?
You can still BUY GME on sofi app
Robinhood to Stash?
Has anyone tried transferring their stocks from Robinhood to Stash? Is it worth it, will it take forever, or are they trying the same bologna Robinhood is? Had shares for GME to process this morning and both got cancelled. Either way I‚Äôm holding and hoping for the best.
GME THEAD: RETURN OF THE RETARDS
Call your Senator or Congressperson!
MODS Please do not remove, this is the way.  Don't  let them get away with this. We the Retards need to use our actual  right to assembly to make real change. We proved the game is rigged now  let's bring it home. Let's make some real change.   Collective power isn't limited to wall street.  You're locked out of robinhood? Don't sell and Call your Senator.  They froze trading? Don't sell and Call your Congressperson.  Explain  to the polite intern who answers what is happening in a calm reasonable  voice. Explain that it is wall street who is acting irresponsibly. That  wall street was stuck in a bad trade and wall street changed the rules  to ensure they always finish on top. Remind them that the US Government  bailed out the banks in 2008 and left our parents out to dry. If they  want us to believe the system still works there should be investigations  into citadel and robinhood. This is untenable.  I  have time, if you have time, keep calling until they do something. If  we do nothing they will side with the banks again. Send them a post  card, send them an email, call them a 7th time.  Find your representative and senators contact info here:

New to stocks. How do I buy more GME with Robinhood blocking it?
TRADING SHOULD BE HALTED IF PEOPLE CANT BUY STOCK
Trading should be halted if people can't buy stocks. This is fucking absolute horse shit. Imagine if brokers all of a sudden did not allow these hedge funds to sell these stocks? There would be lawsuits everywhere. FUCK this bull shit.

The only real stock is GME everything else is noise
The amount of astroturfing going on is unreal. Eyes on the fuckin money boys. GME is the only stock where they're historically overleveraged. Buy the dip. I just yolod like 15 k because I like this stock.   This is not financial advise.
AMC TO THE FUCKING MOON
Let‚Äôs get it   20c March and 10 shares
All day yesterday everyone in the media and powers of position said they wanted to protect the retail investors and this is about looking out for the little guy
So their solution to that was to ban buying on positions they know you currently own and making it impossible to buy, and only sell. The writing is on the wall. But hey, atleast they can protect us from randomly upgrading or downgrading a stock they own positions in!
Noob here :)
I have looked at multiple stock exchange platforms, and data services, and i am no sure ehat to go for. I know some services are straight up scamming, and i could really use some advise :).  I am not planning to invest a lot of money, just going to see what i could do.  Figured many new people also had some questions ;)

App to trade outside US? Looking for Advice
Hello guys, looking for a recommentation yo trade outside US that I can use with a debit card. I have read about fidelity, webull, sofi but dont know if they work for people outside US. I would love to buy some GME
[Serious] Why do people use Robin Hood?‚ö†Ô∏è
Unless I'm reading this wrong ( , Robin Hood sells order flow and data to trading firms, allowing the firms to front-run and scalp their customers (sounds kinda like what happens in the book 'Flash Boys').  I've done comparisons between by boomer bank and another discount brokerage. Boomer bank gives me a slightly better price (few cents times many shares more than makes up for the trading fee), the orders are executed more quickly and I'm (fairly) confident they aren't selling my data to external parties.
GME is nearly below the big jump yesterday

‚úåÔ∏è out RH
Just started reading and it doesn't seem to make sense to trade with a broker that is so obviously owned by big business.  Pulled out all my positions and going elsewhere. Amy suggestions my friends?
Do we hold or no
I bought 10 shares at 298 so I‚Äôm kind of worried right now
HOLD as people move to other trading platforms such as Cash App! Fuck Robinhood
Let people have time to adjust to the piece of shit Robinhood criminals and transition to other platforms. HOLD and BUY on down days  EDIT: Can‚Äôt buy on cash app. Go for Fidelity! ADAPT and HOLD THE FUCKING LINE
This is a fake selloff purely from Market Manipulation. Do not sell.
Look at the volume. It's barely above 2 million. The only reason it is going down is because Buy orders are not allowed to be placed. Every broker than runs through Citadel is having this issue.  Doesn't matter, I will  never  SELL my shares at this point. I will do my part to make this as financially painful as possible.  Position GME 67 @ $15
STOP FUCKING SELLING
Question about the restriction of GME sales
How is it not market manipulation when these trading apps restrict the ability to trade certain stocks, but this subreddit is accused constantly of mm when we‚Äôre here just talking about what we‚Äôre trading.
Long time user leaving WSB
Hi There,  Been active here since 2016 on this and multiple accounts. I am very sad about this community blowing up. I spent hours here everyday and now its gone to shit. Its been going to shit for awhile, but the influx on new noob users is diluting the already few high quality DD's. I can't wait for another cleansing. I've made this point to a few friends who just found out about it and they all tell me I'm being selfish. That might be true, but this is a huge part of my life and the only community I have that understands my struggles and this is a very lonely profession. This is becoming StockTwits. I no longer have a home.     Until the great cleansing....
Fuck Robinhood, you can easily buy on Cashapp
It took me like five minutes. I don't support the bullshit Robinhood is trying to pull, buy on Cashapp and FUCKING HOLD!
BUY MORE YOU FUCKTARDS GME IS ON SALE
TO THE FUCKING MOON WE GO            /u/
They‚Äôre getting away with it. Went from $21k to below $10k
Holding GME? I got in this morning BEFORE the dip. DIAMOND. HANDS. HERE.
Anyone still holding GME despite the blatant manipulation going on? I have no choice to. Win or lose it all.
Is there any light at the end of the tunnel as to when we will be able to buy again on ShitHood?
What‚Äôs the end game here keep us locked out from buying $GME and other stocks? When will this end? The market today is almost at its halfway point and we still can‚Äôt buy? How long can they continue to lock its users out, drive the price back down to $30?

Same thing happened before!
STOP PUSHING NOK
NOK has a ridiculous market cap and only a small % of shorts. It's a distraction to the GME cause.    NOK with market cap of 22Bil at time of writing compared to GME at   Meaning you need to dump another 22bil to double it's value (to the moon) and with only   short the squeeze will not be like GME. Is a total distraction trying to get people to dump their money elsewhere.
Just put in a buy order for AMC as soon as it unfreezes. First time I've bought stocks in 5 years.  ‚ú®
Put some of my money into BB for help paying off my computer, and now I‚Äôm fucked because of Robinhood? This story line is fucking insane, we are changing America boys, let‚Äôs go  üèª

$AAL ADDED ON THIS LIST. WTF. I got in on some calls BEFORE they locked out. SOMEONE OR SOMETHING IS MONITORING THE SUB TO NIT PICK AND LOCK CERTAIN SECURITIES!!
Who else is independently rubbing their hands with glee at when Robinhood does an IPO so they can absolutely short the living fuck out of them? I‚Äôm going to try my hardest so that any investor in Robinhood gets ground into the dirt
Europoor Holding the line, fuck em.
I'm a europoor retard in ‚Ç¨5000 on GME. This morning I had no problems trading stocks before NYSE open, however the moment it opened my broker crapped out for >30mins, not allowing me to buy GME for cheap. Meanwhile GME price went up to new ATH, now from what I've heard on here very little people were able to buy just like me, so why did the price go up? It's obvious this was an orchestrated action that took place all over the world.   I'm not selling. If I lose the money so be it.   Using degiro btw, lemme know if any other Europeans had the same problems. I want to start legal action against these platforms in EU too, just like Americans are starting to organise.
VW 2008 had a huge dip just before the squeeze!!!! just like GME
This huge dip in GME may well be similar and the theory is that if they reach a point where they think they cant tank the price any lower they may start buying back shorts triggering the squeeze. I know Shit all about this stuff but it would make sense to tank the price before you buy.
Hey WSB Family
PLEASEEEED HOLD!!!!!
Interactive brokers not letting me buy GME?
I'm retarded and new to this. Trying to buy one stock of GME. Literally one. I got logged out, had to re enter my password, ny verification code, got told it was close-only trade, selected market-on-close, order immediately failed. Wtf is going on? Is it me?

Thank you for normalizing autism.
Time to discuss societal gains. Autism isn‚Äôt well-understood by many and so folks with autism experience prejudice associated with that ignorance. This subreddit has highlighted the atypical thinking and behavior associated with autism with regards to outside the box trading and in doing so lionized autism as something beneficial.  As someone who has a few people with autism near and dear to his heart, I thank you for what you have done and I encourage the continued positive use of the comparison.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST REEEEEE
If it's free, you're the product. Order flow is how RH makes money. And fines are cheaper than a squeeze.
So robinhood and others aren't letting people buy, which is tanking the share price, we all know this. Robinhood uses Citadel as it's primary market maker, and Robinhood makes their money buy selling order flow to the market maker. Basically citadel is the one that butters their bread.   Citadel is also one of the main bag holders of shorts. So, this is absolutely egregious market manipulation (we know this).    But here's the really shitty part. The fine is cheaper than what would happen in a squeeze. So they don't care. The SEC is toothless.
GME is now on sale; if you haven't gotten in yet, now's the time! Market manipulations to decrease the price will only work in our favor    DO NOT SELL
[REPOST] calm down people. this is a psychological warfare at this stage. also mods please dont shadowban. people really need to hear this
the market may not be doing well today because of scumbag robinhood and its hedge fund goonies but it doesn't matter. we're gonna get through this shitstorm stronger and more united than before. don't worry about GME for now. there are still frontline fighters on webull and fidelity holding the line for us. spread the word about robinhood and get a good night's sleep. tomorrow will be huge because of 1) a fuckton of ITM calls expiring and 2) fuckton of puts expiring as well. the stock may be tanking crazy right now but there is nothing to worry about. this is a question of supply and demand. the shorts will have to cover eventually. it is impossible that they just sit on their asses and keep paying extremely high interests for their shorts. we just have to keep an eye out for the short interest everyday. days to cover, as well. this is a sure fire win for us, but we must first pass this test of resilience and faith in GME. this is where the paper-handed MOFOs are phased out of the game and bound to a life of regret. we are at the phase where we are about to take off but cannot because there are some minor issues with the window that are blocking the view. once we get past this, we will reach tendieland soon. trust the process and DFV. he has led us into this battle against one of the largest hedge funds and we are my penis' length away from defeating them. remember :    and obligatory     for the tards who can't read.
What's on here?
I WILL LOSE EVERY SINGLE FUCKING PENNY BEFORE I SELL MY GME. BUY THE DIP. APES TOGETHER STRONG. DONT LET THEM STRONGARM US INTO SELLING, HEDGEFUNDS AND WALLSTREET CAN SUCK MY DICK.
Is Ally invest manipulating like robinhood?
I have been unable to access my ally account all day. When I log in I receive the message "we can not show these accounts right now" which pretty much means I'm dead in the water. Anyone else here use Ally and getting the same message?

Memers saving America
If a few million of us memers can bring back companies from the grave and make companies like Robinhood shit their pants, what's stopping us from saving the economy? Literally, if more kids actually got interested in these kind of things early on, the change is gonna be big and it's gonna be inevitable. Now stop reading this shit and go buy some diamond tendies.
SHOULD I SELL
AYO I BOUGHT 250 SHARES OF NOK CAUSE I FUCKIN WANTED TO AND NOW IM WONDERING IF I SHOULD HOLD LIKE EVERYONE ELSE OR IF I SHOULD SELL THAT MF AND TAKE A LOSS
Robinhood has to be the stupidest trading platform in the history of mankind. Do they honestly think they will get away with this? When the dust settles, they'll have no where to hide. RIP Robinhood.
seems you can buy AMC with cashapp investing
robinhood as fucked us but viewing cashapp investing I can buy AMC but not BB or GME     Stash,and a few other apps are also currently overloaded  after now attempting to buy another AMC on cashapp it has given me a connection error  wonder if they are trying to choke us out
Hold line.
They are trying to scare us away from NOK!! Buy Buy Buy!!

It's Time to Mobilize Our International Retards!
Hey fellow autists! Your American friends could use some help. We've been locked out of our market by brokers sympathetic to rich hedge fund ass-hats. We need our international brethren to buy the dip and help us eat the rich. So buy you spaghetti eating retards! If you had beans for breakfast you need to buy some BB.  If you had rice for breakfast today, you need to buy some GME. If you speak anything besides truck stop American, BUY! BUY! BUY!  Help us teach these boomer hedge fund billionaires a lesson and take the power back.

Update on Brokerage bullshitery
Brokerages increased margin on all meme stocks, meaning you have to pay more in a margin account. Lots of people haven‚Äôt realized this and are calling brokerages asking what‚Äôs happening, and the brokerages explain what‚Äôs going on, then TELLING them to liquidate or forcing it.  I know because I have a ROTH IRA with tasty. Tasty doesn‚Äôt allow margin on Roth‚Äôs. They sent me an email telling me I had excessive risk due to an AMC position (400 shares, -2 calls short, 2 calls long).   I asked why and they explained that margin had increased on basically every meme stock ‚Äúto protect customers and the platform‚Äù. I asked if they were going to force liquidate and they said I would have a few hours to cough up cash, close out at a loss, or they would force liquidate.  But my Roth IRA doesn‚Äôt allow me to use margin, everything was owned directly by me. I told him this and he realized his mistake because he had been telling people who had margin accounts over and over again during the day to liquidate.   IF YOU STILL HAVE SHARES NOT IN A MARGIN ACCOUNT, HOLD. MARGIN ACCOUNTS a sHOULD REDUCE UNTIL THEY‚ÄôRE NOT USING a MARGIN.
GME is at 153? Tf?
can someone explain
YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING AWESOME AND IT NEEDS TO BE SAID
I don't invest much, i'm mainly here for the memes BUT HOLY SHIT.  YOU GUYS LITERALLY SHOOK THE ENTIRE COMMON WEALTH. EVEN HERE IN FRANCE U MADE IT IN THE HEADLINES.   This just warms my heart seeing that the power is still in the People's hands, and i would like to thank you my fellow epic autists for proving all these old farts in suit that THERE IS HOPE IN THIS SHIT WORLD. KEEP FKING HOLDING I JUST INVESTED 5K IN GME.

Now a lot of people should be in the red, you have no reason not to hold out!!
HOLD, THIS LOOK SUPER SUS
you are saying they are all dropping with less than 1million volume in 5 minutes on a stock thats 71million shares short?
I'm not an American investor, but to those in the US, is there a regulatory agency that can get involved to force Robinhood and other platforms to allow buying? It seems like clear market manipulation to only allow selling
Just wondering what the options are for traders on those platforms besides holding and possibly launching a class action lawsuit later.  Is there any chance of an emergency intervention?
Here's the reason we cant trade the stocks that we love
mods please dont delete this.      TLDR: Robinhood will be the fall guy for the GME squeeze.   My prediction:   Robinhood will be the only victim of what has happened these last few days. As much as I hate to say it, the hedge funds who shorted 140% of shares will walk away without any problems just as they did in 2008. These massive hedge funds know that nothing illegal has happened on reddit or in general so trying to shut us down for market manipulation wont happen.  So how will they take their revenge? By bringing down Robinhood. I would not be surprised that Robinhood was forced to prevent retail investors from trading amc, gme, bb and nok to manipulate the market enough for these boomers to recoup some of their losses.    Why do I think this?:    Right now, as we speak RH is prevent retail investors from buying any of these "volatile" shares.  We know that robinhood front runs orders so citadel and others can see retail investors moves. I am willing to bet all my tendies that RH will be the only casualty from all of this. The vast majority of us have been trading on RH. With the insane amount of volume and calls going through RH, the SEC will investigate them and determine that there was most likely wrongdoing (because naked shorts apparently are fine).   This is not advice to withdraw the money from RH, but we know the rules dont apply to the rich and the billion (probably only million by now) dollar boomer hedge funders are out for blood.    There have supposedely been more 100% out of money calls bought through RH than anywhere else. This alone would probably get them investigated by the SEC. But NOW they are preventing us from buying GME, BB, NOK and AMC. The MMs are trying to shake us. They are trying to cause such a drop that we sell our shares to their over leveraged boomer asses out of fear of losing our gainz.   The hedge funds are going to try to shut RH down or severely cripple it so its harder for retail investors to ever do anything like what happened with GME ever again.    What am I going to do about this?   I am filing a complaint with the SEC and you should too.   If you read this far, thanks and stay strong out there!!!
REMINDER: you only lose money if you sell at a loss ü§≤  forever holding
It‚Äôs time to sit on your bets boys. We went in for a reason, it‚Äôs time to stay in and ride it out. Don‚Äôt sell away your savings to the funds at a loss. Hold that shit and buy more when your restrictions are gone cause fuck em that‚Äôs why!   Good luck and love you all, papa bless
Why this won‚Äôt get coverage
Too much shit is happening in the world right now. Or at least the United States.   They‚Äôre not gonna give a flying duck about us unless bigger figures step in like Elon musk or that rich investor that bought calls.   We have blm movement (been quiet for a minute now though), the Trump squad hitting the Senate, and just random shit here and there.   This is the least of their worries.  We need help

Guys just hold. This is the big dip right before a huge squeeze it‚Äôs normal
They know tomorrow is gonna be a big day. So they‚Äôre trying to scare us. HOLDD
GME SHORT FLOAT STILL ABOVE 120%
It doesn‚Äôt matter what happens to the stock today or tomorrow. As long as you hold the squeeze will still occur, the only difference is at what price. If you continue to hold and buy if you can, they will get squeezed at a higher price. They are trying to drive the price down and cause panic. That‚Äôs all. Keep holding
DO NOT FOLD
You guys have to realize that this is a psychological GAME now. They WANT you to be scared. They halt the market then dump out shares to scare you to sell. Do not fold.
DO NOT SELL! This is what they want! HOLD!
Why are they calling you guys Nazis?
I'm not a participant of this subreddit, but I know enough about reddit to know that all but a few subs are left-leaning. Many heavily lean left, and the really big subs unanimously lean left.  So why is the mainstream media calling you guys Nazis, alt-right actors, and comparing you to the people who stormed the capitol?  I'll tell you why, because it's something that has been happening to us moderate, right-centrist conservatives for years now, at least since 2017. You've done something that the main stream media and other powerful individuals don't like, something they  actually  don't like. You've done something that goes against the narrative they'd like to create, that goes against the power structures they have put in place, and you did it using their own system against them. So they resort to their tried and true tactic: you're Nazis. You're greedy, selfish fascists, alt-right radicals, possibly terrorists, even!  You know you're not alt-right radicals. Most of you probably hate even moderately right-wing views. We probably wouldn't get along in any other context, because I lean center-right. You know that these groups are straight-up lying about you and your political views.  Welcome to our world. It's been happening to us for years now. Any time we protest (I'm not talking about the capitol, but things like people going in their cars to protest lockdowns - not even outside, in their cars), it's "alt-right radicals," "neo-Nazi proud boys," etc. When really, it's just ordinary people who don't like the status quo and want to change it.  That's what's happening to you right now. You are living through it. I have sympathy for you, because I know what it's like to feel like I'm being lumped in with violent radicals and racists when I'm none of those things.  You know you're not Nazis. I know you're not Nazis. They know you're not Nazis. But the masses who know nothing about Reddit's political tendencies, have never heard of /r/wallstreetbeets and don't even know why there's an r in front of it, and who are just now hearing about this in the context of articles telling them there are "alt-right connections" and "parallels to Nazis" here don't know that, and they'll believe the lie because they've believed the same lie over and over and over again.  The next time you read about an event "organized by Nazis" or a group "with ties to the alt-right," just think about this moment, and ask yourself, is that the truth? Or is it just narrative? Dig deeper, and find out if it's really the alt-right (because yes, sometimes it really is), or is it ordinary people who are tired of the status quo finally trying to do something about it?

HOLD GME!! BUY CELH!! GET THOSE    !! THEY BLOCK, WE PIVOT!

I bought $AMC weeks before for fun because I go there often and had spare change, so why am I being punished by brokers in a FREE TRADE market?
How is this fair to the average person? Manipulating the market and hiding shares so you cannot buy them, this only makes tensions higher and affects shareholders negatively. I only put $30 into AMC but money is money and in a free market NO broker should ever have this kind of power over the will of the buyer/seller
Switch to REVOLUT guys - still allowing GME/ BB/ AMC buys.
The Big Boys are trying everything in the book to separate you from you share - Don't let them do it!
Working people get squeezed every damn day of the week and no one bats  an eye.   Wall Street gets squeezed for one day and it‚Äôs a national  emergency.   Power to the people, hold your GME tight and strong!  If your brokerage won't  trade your stock switch over to one of those boomer brokerage like  Fidelity.
Solidarity from The Little Guy
Got in late like many of us, couldn't afford GME anymore, and only maanged to get one measley share of AMC before Robinhood turned cloak.  Just wanted to say, as insignificant as it may seem, I am not selling, and I hope anyone in my position will do the same. I don't have nearly as much invested here as some of you, but I support you and feel like we are in this together.   Those of you who put so much energy and funds in to this, know that regardless of stakes, we rise and fall as one.
ARE YOU PUSSIES SELLING???
One online broker tries to stop us and everyone is jumping ship?  I was late to this party and I'm still holding and as soon as me webull account gets approved I'm buying more on sale!

So my brother bought AMC stock last night. I opted out because I had never bought stock before and didn't want to take the risk with a lot of money for a first time buy. Well, it's doing incredibly well now, and he says if I'm interested in buying stock now I should aim for Nokia (he says the subreddit is planning to buy it out at some point). I would like to know when however, so I can buy too.
DON'T PANIC!!
A short squeeze is a roller coaster ride from hell.  Keep your head on straight.  This ALWAYS HAPPENS in a short squeeze

TastyWorks has halted buying of GME.
I pulled up my TW account after Robinhood gave GME the banhammer and suddenly a bright red "halted" square popped up on GME. It's now sell only.
Who can I get in contact with regarding a lawsuit against Robinhood? I had a pre-market order for GME stock and they just canceled it on me without fulfilling it. No warnings, plenty of capital to cover the investment.... they just didn't honor it.
If anyone knows a good lawyer, I'd love the details. Thanks!
What's wrong ETRADE????
Ok, I was trying to become a retard and ride the     on Robinhood but I don't think my transfer was going through for some manipulative reason. Then I saw that those asshats at Robincuck are cancelling trading of GME. SO, I try to make an account with Etrade. I get a notice that they aren't able to process my application at this time and to call them or online chat them. Guess what, I call them saying I'm making a new account and THEIR LINES ARE DOWN DUE TO "TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES." That's some hot BS right there folks.
My money gone!

Cancel Robinhood Gold
The title is the whole post. I know a lot of you are probably using Robinhood Gold. So cancel it today and tell them why.
This is hunt Brothers   (story time)
Back in the big silver rallies decades ago, the face were 2 rich bros that were worried about the US being solvent, we were off the Gold standard & budgets were getting out of hand. The hunt Brothers then started buying large comex contracts, but unlike most metal traders, these guys stood for delivery üöö. They got many arabian oil OPEC nations to start buying silver as it was a better form of payment than fiat USD.     Fast forward the price of silver skyrockets, since like $GME shorts selling shares that don't exist, the bouillon shorts were selling metal that they don't actually have. Today it's estimated 100 paper golds is backed by 1 physical gold, and 200 paper silvers backed 1 by 1 oz of physical.     Now here we are, the hunt Brothers look like they have won, despite the constant margin raises by the COMEX/SEC, those crooks took it to the next level. "Liquidation orders only", in other words you can sell but not buy. Literally the same plan wallstreet/sec/government/NASDAQ is doing today. They have conspired with all the $0 trade platforms and are only allowing liquidation orders to fuck us all.   The hunt Brothers were made an example of, don't let them do the same to us. Melvin Capital still needs to buy back 140% of those shares back, don't sell, don't give then liquidity. At this point, its not about the money, I want to see them collapse.    This is not financial advice, only storytime.
They pulled out all the stops for this. Actually scared of us.
Tbh I am fucking livid. They repeatedly slandered us, said we are "basement dwellers who couldn't take risk", called us alt right, fascists, nazis. They flooded this place with bots spamming other things to get other people to not buy GME. Every article, every clip in the news, every fucking reporter talked about how this place is some sort of economic terror group, when its everything opposite of that. And now they decided to go all in.  I didn't think they would stoop this low to actually straight up force brokerages to stop selling and allowing us to buy GME. I get slander, but this is a whole new level. Anyone have a total list of every broker who banned GME?  Never thought I would get actually angry at Wall Street for this kind of bullshit but here we are.
#RIPRobinhood
Make that hashtag trend on Twitter! We need them to understand that we WILL leave them to fail if they keep playing with us! WE hold the power, without us they‚Äôre worthless. Let‚Äôs all start looking for other platforms, it‚Äôs clear that Robinhood doesn‚Äôt want us to reach the moon.
How do I buy gme outside of us?
First time trading anything. Just want to invest to be part of the train with a small amount. Like 50-100‚Ç¨ max.  But how do I buy them?
I would rather guide my dad into my mum, than selling my stocks. Hold strong fellow retards, it's gonna be rough but the reward will be sweet. $BB $GME to the fucking end of the known universe
Reactivated my old stash account and purchased GME & AMC last night and they seem to have gone through.   Is stash a good app to do this with?
What‚Äôs done is done so I‚Äôm riding it regardless. Just wondering what the general opinion of stash is as an investment app.
SMOOTHBRAINS! THERE'S BIG BRAIN SHIT GOING ON! READ THIS! IMPORTANT!
First off, this is not investment advice, this is just my stupid opinion and theory(ies).  Don't delete your Robinhood just yet.  Remember it takes several days to verify accounts for other trading platforms, and several days to get your money flowing into it, and get you trading. Effectively taking you off the market for a week or more.  Also, now that TD Ameritrade has banned trading on GME, the only one left for us Americans, that I know of is WeBull. Who knows if they'll stand.     Now, let's think about what's going on here.   All retail trading platforms are disabling buy options for GME, openly manipulating the market to drive the price down.  Now what's this squeeze we've been talking about? All the Hedgefunds shorting GME, will have to buy all their shorted stonks at market value. Well if they drive the price way down, guess what? It's the perfect opportunity for these fuckers to eat their shorts, with way less damage.  So if you sell, you're giving money right back to the Hedgefunds! They will use this opportunity, today, tomorrow, next week, I don't fucking know, to reduce their loss.  HOLD!!! (for now)     NEXT PART! VERY IMPORTANT!  Here's where it gets more insidious (And I start to understand a little less gud, so correct me if I'm wrong.  Right when the Hedgefunds are buying their shorts, or whatever, at market value, would be a good time for all the retail brokerage platforms to enable buying again. If they time everything right, We will see the option to buy again, and the STONK going UP, simultaneously, and we'll all freak out, and go BUY! BUY! BUY!, But, the hedgefunds will already have boughten in, and will be riding our wave, and then they'll DUMP us, and leave us HOLDING THE BAG!  What do we do? I DON'T KNOW! I'm assuming HOLD!, but I don't know what's next. This is for someone with a bigger brain, a bigger dick, and a bigger wife's boyfriend to figure out, So upvote this shit so they can see it, and figure it out!  Position: All in   shares GME (I'm poor)

I wish I had the money to buy rn the stock looks so good
GME - this happened 3 days ago.
What you're seeing right now is a retrace to before GME gapped up 130% yesterday. If you want to compare symbols, remember VW also had a very sharp pullback before the massive squeeze up.        Today's chart:             Jan 25th.      Processing img 7c9dcvfsk3e61...   See how the stock rose up massive in the AM and then dumped and then recovered at 9:30 PST (12:30 EST).
Pull my cash from Robinhood?
Hello, I had created a RH account this morning to buy up some stocks, but the ones I wanted are no longer available for purchase. Should I pull out my money from the app before making any purchases? Is there an app I CAN use to get on this rocket to the moon?  Sincerely, Soon-to-be-retard
Don‚Äôt sell! It‚Äôs a trick

STASH Complaint?
I am a humble retard with two questions:     1. Can I file a complaint against Stash using  ? 2. What other platforms can I transfer to that isn‚Äôt robinhood/we bull or anyone of these assholes trying to shut shit down?    Either way, I have the backs of my fellow retards ‚ù§Ô∏è
That first half I lost $30k and Robinhood did nothing to protect me. That last line is where I made $70k and they protected institutions from me. Thanks so much!
Download SoFi to buy the dip! GME and other aren‚Äôt blocked. You can invest today, no need for new account approval like TD, Webull, etc.

AMC Crashing Again?
So AMC was poised to rise again then suddenly dips again this is going to be a fun time, thank you Robinhood for cucking everyone same with Webull and Cashapp for trying to get rid of the free market
would a robinhood class action lawsuit apply to only rh users?
Or would us who lost money under other brokers (that still allow trading GME) also have a case?
This is pure manipulation. Breathe and hold.
The volume is too little to cause this much of a sell off, the bid and ask spread is too large. This is exactly what happened before the VW squeeze; they are using dirty tactics to make you scared and sell. But we don't fucking sell. This will moon. Hold.
We're in This Together
WSB now
Stay strong you stallions and HOLD. We rise this to VALHALLA!
Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.  It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.  DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.  These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.  Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.  Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.  This is a repost!!!!!!
This is a beautiful thing!!!!!!
Let this be a lesson that Wall Street does not care about helping anyone but their cronies, I will continue to hold but most importantly, this should show everyone that you need to support local business owners and not huge corps, they want you to bring down local mom and pop shops to help prop up their buddies and bring the working man to his knees. RETURNING GOTHAM TO THE PEOPLE!

RUn UP DOGECOIN
Robinhood just made my life a whole lot easier.
What's that? I can't buy any more GME? What a scarce and valuable stock...      Better keep Everything I have, since I can't get more.     I really want to HOLD more than ever before in my life. My conviction to HOLD has suddenly skyrocketed to the star system where this stock is going. I can't buy more? Better HOLD. Especially since this isn't just about money, it's about so much more, I just can't help but have an insatiable desire to HOLD. And especially since this is good community of people doing good, helping the underdog, I just have this insatiable desire to HOLD.     I think I finally truly understand what it feels like to have diamond hands. Thanks, Robinhood. Also, we're gonna sue you.

Volume is LOW. Which means the price falling doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the big boys backing out. It‚Äôs purely because RH won‚Äôt allow buying which brings the price down a ton. It‚Äôll bounce.

The Robinhood BAN Conspiracy Theory
What Robinhood is doing is illegal. They know this, we know this, and the hedge funds know this.   They will be forced to reopen trading on GME very soon. This ‚Äúban‚Äù is an attempt for institutions to cover their shorts and/or get long at a great price. They know they cannot stop the public.  Stay woke.
I KEEP BUYING THE DIP TODAY, THIS IS AMAZING, I INITIALLY GOT IN AT $350 BUT TODAY KEPT BUYING AROUND $250 AND NOW $127, I WILL KEEP BUYING AND HOLDING, WE HOLD THE SHARES, THIS IS OUR GAME, FULL SUPPORT FROM CAN TO US
I think Robinhood will take the fall for the GME  squeeze and here's why.
mods please dont delete this.    First I wanna say, if you bought GME, welcome to the           TLDR: Robinhood will be the fall guy for the GME squeeze.   My prediction:   Robinhood will be the only victim of what has happened these last few days. As much as I hate to say it, the hedge funds who shorted 140% of shares will walk away without any problems just as they did in 2008. These massive hedge funds know that nothing illegal has happened on reddit or in general so trying to shut us down for market manipulation wont happen.  So how will they take their revenge? By bringing down Robinhood. I would not be surprised that Robinhood was forced to prevent retail investors from trading amc, gme, bb and nok to manipulate the market enough for these boomers to recoup some of their losses.    Why do I think this?:    Right now, as we speak RH is prevent retail investors from buying any of these "volatile" shares.  We know that robinhood front runs orders so citadel and others can see retail investors moves. I am willing to bet all my tendies that RH will be the only casualty from all of this. The vast majority of us have been trading on RH. With the insane amount of volume and calls going through RH, the SEC will investigate them and determine that there was most likely wrongdoing (because naked shorts apparently are fine).   This is not advice to withdraw the money from RH, but we know the rules dont apply to the rich and the billion (probably only million by now) dollar boomer hedge funders are out for blood.    There have supposedely been more 100% out of money calls bought through RH than anywhere else. This alone would probably get them investigated by the SEC. But NOW they are preventing us from buying GME, BB, NOK and AMC. The MMs are trying to shake us. They are trying to cause such a drop that we sell our shares to their over leveraged boomer asses out of fear of losing our gainz.   The hedge funds are going to try to shut RH down or severely cripple it so its harder for retail investors to ever do anything like what happened with GME ever again.    What am I going to do about this?   I am filing a complaint with the SEC and you should too.   If you read this far, thanks and stay strong out there!!!
I Still like the stocks and I‚Äôm not fucking selling

Why this is bullshit, what is happening, why to hold
Basically all retail brokers are now limiting GME. Retail traders are restricted, institutional traders are not.   The affect is a distortion of supply and demand. Retail can't buy, but are being encouraged to flood the market with sells, pushing the price downwards to effectively help hedge funds out of the short squeeze.   Total bullshit.   If you listen to financial media a big 'concern' is retail holding the bag. That was never a given. The most popular thesis behind GME's surge was that shorts must cover, at any price. THEY would be the ones holding the bag  the people who shorted a stock in excess of 100% of its float. The people who took on an unimaginable level of risk.   Hedge funds created the conditions for what is now occurring. Not retail. WSB users were just smart enough to exploit the opening that the hedge funds created.   With their move today, Robinhood set the stage for retail to lose. Other brokers followed their lead. They are elevating the supply side, gagging demand, pushing the price down to fuck us over and let the greedy hedge fund players off the hook, despite the risk they've taken and the conditions they created. It was their doing. Now Robinhood is taking action that can leave their own clients holding the bag, which is shameful.   To me this proves we are not their customer, we're the product. Citadel is Robinhood's largest market maker, who at the same time back the funds responsible for this short. Bet they had something to do with it.   If the line is held, if enough traders don't sell, we can keep supply at bay, and the demand by short sellers to cover their positions will still be there. The shorts are yet to be sharted. This is not financial advice.
BE LONG TERM GREEDY -- HOLD GME, AMC, BB
Be long term greedy, don‚Äôt give up at the first hurdle. Going to be a lot of starts and stops. Start with the end in time, figure out how to get there along the way.
What platform is everyone switching too?
Fidelity? ETrade?
Which trading apps still allows trading for GME? DIP OF THE LIFETIME!!
Ameritrade just unlocked my acct
I'm not advocating any positions but I will say I've been somewhat active on some trades recently. Ameritrade restricted my acct so I couldn't purchase.  I had a few K that I just transferred, an additional couple of K that I earned in the last two days, and no positions so it kind of pissed me off. Can't liquidate if I don't have anything to liquidate. I called their line, they called my bank to "confirm" funds. I honestly think it was a very convenient mistake blamed on my bank but Ameritrade has fully restored my acct.  So if in doubt, call them. It may be a "mistake" on their end. Shits getting dirty.
CNBC - time to consider those on xfinity to find new providers - they are treating today like it is a usual day in the market and none of this push back is real
Almost like nothing happened... and this is how survival mode looks... Jimmy Chill silent - sqwak bax playing naive card ... they are playing the sucks to be u card....  if u have xfinity, time to switch
Not an L TILL YOU SELL. BUY THE DIP & HOLD ON BOYS THEY CANNOT WIN
YOLO on GME - let‚Äôs burn these hedge fund managers down. I almost starved to death in 2008!

Is it worth buying 1 or more $GMT stocks?
Hi ya'll, I'm a 15 year old amd as any other 15 year old I wanna make some money. Anyway, is it worth it to buy one of those trading stocks at the moment, $GMT no matter it's cost?  I've got a good few hundreds of euros and my parents agreed in buying one of those stocks. Now, I don't really know anything in stocks so I am not sure if I should buy $GMT stocks or not. I also don't know when to sell it. I will stay in this community until someone won't start selling or something like that
Go buy AMCüí∞üìà

AS SOON AS ROBINHOOD LETS GO OF THE HOLD, BUY GME AND BUY AMC
These Wall St big dogs are trying to scare you into selling. Don‚Äôt fucking sell. Hold and double down. We‚Äôre squeezing these fuckers and they‚Äôre trying to snake their way out - but it‚Äôs time to choke out this snake.
If you sell you are doing exactly what they want
Negatively review Robinhood RIGHT NOW! Get on Revolut! BUY $GME AT A MASSIVE DISCOUNT!
im scared
someone please tell me this is gonna be okay. I put in 1600 this morning and its now dipping lower than it has in the past few days
Bought another 24 shares through Scotiabank, buy and hold!!!
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
Just watching my stock plummet, but f$$k it I'm all in.
This is the doing of the SEC.
In order for the brokerages to have delisted the stocks, they would have to have talked and gotten permission from the SEC. This was market manipulation done by the SEC. The SEC and the brokerages and the big money and the government are all in bed together to fuck us.  Sue. Protest. Whatever the hell we have to do. This is not the difference between Republican or Democrat or Liberal or Conservative, this is the difference between the rich establishment and the poor working class.
STOP SELLING YOUR FUCKING GME SHARES NOOBS   HOLD HOLD HOLD DIAMOND DICKS
Take these mother fuckers down boys.  .  .
I‚Äôm a brand spanking new autist and wanted to get in on the ground level yesterday with GME. Fidelity is down. Robinhood has obviously shit the fucking bed, and now none of the exchanges are giving me a chance to buy. Boo fuckity hoo for me, but I am cheering you mother fuckers on. Heaven  fucking  forbid the little guy gets to finally win, and I am enjoying the show from the sidelines. Make your money and burn this fucker to the ground. GME to goddamn Pluto
ITS ALL OR NOTHING BROTHERS

HOLD THE LINE! this is the part of the story when things get seemingly worse before they get better.    !

Looks like the APP rating is getting trashed. Good.
Reminder to Exercise call options, the shorts are going all out today and don't have the shares to cover
HOLD
Tastyworks (due to ApexClearing) has also halted buying of GME, (AMC, KOSS)
The government should bail us out!!
If we are forced to waste our taxpayer dollars on the shorting idiots in hedge funds, then we should be allowed the same protection!!  Why protect shitty institutions but not your own citizens!?
How to get into stocks you can‚Äôt search on robinhood
robinhood has stopped allowing people to search for stocks that are super popular right now.   Use this to get into them. I don‚Äôt know for sure if it works because I don‚Äôt have Robinhood but please try and let us know.    [the ticker for the stocks]
Lost most of my money... this was my entire savings, I have my last $300 paycheck in the bank right now and that‚Äôs all. Thought of selling when I was up $600. Oh well, don‚Äôt really have much more to lose
To the panic sellers. You're going to miss the squeeze.
Dumb dumbs. But the dips
Everybody. Drop Robinhood and bring your  ü§≤ to a new Fidelity account. Leave your GME from robinhood untouched though.
Stock price is going lower than $130 as I type. Just create a new Fidelity account and do it from there.  Keep only your GME on robinhood, drop the other shit and bring that cash to fidelity to buy more
Market Manipulation: Wall Street don't mind the fine.
Think about it. If GME goes to $1000+ they will lose tens, maybe hundreds of billions, if they manipulate the market they will at most get a couple of billion dollar fine.  This is what happens when Wall Street knows that no matter how hard it fucks up it will get bailed out and no one goes to prison.   They can't get away with it this time.
The suits won again
Paper handed bitches gonna let them win
HOLD.
When the price reached $450 my only regret is that I didn't buy more at $80. Time to go in, BUY AND HOLD! WE GOT THIS!
Evidently, everyone has shit themselves
The prices have tanked and all you   hand shit posters and   abusers have pussied out  I am still holding but what now, realistic answers please I'm in way too deep
MMs got Robinhood buy the balls
Here is my overly simplified guess at what happened, but I am an idiot so I am probably wrong.  MMs that all these brokerages deal with sold their calls and covered them based on the delta at the time (delta \[0,1\] is the change in option price/change in share price, OTM calls have really low deltas so if you sell a call option for 100 shares and the delta is   you by 10 shares to cover it). As the stock price increases and the calls become more in ITM the delta goes up and the MMs have to buy more shares.   Maybe the MM didn't adjust their cover over the last few days and so to do it they are halting buying for retail so that they can drive the price down and buy themselves to cover.      I cant see why Robinhood who makes money on selling order flow to MM would stop only purchase. They have no stake in the share price at all, but if MMs said halt or we wont buy your data anymore....
Transferring Shares
Can this autist transfer her shares to Webull from Robinhood. I will not fucking sell but I for sure don't want Robinhood handling my money.
HOLD AMC UNTIL ITS THE SAME PRICE AS A TICKET AND A REUSABLE POPCORN BUCKET

If you're worried, here's what you should do

WHY ARE YOU ALL SELLING? WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS WAR!
HOLD AND WIN
Requesting a legal guide for Robinhood users
No idea what I'm doing, aside from losing money. How do I start? What evidence can I be collecting?
Just filed my first class action lawsuit against Robinhood Financial, LLC. Here's all the info you need to fill out a form!!
If any of you guys are as mad as me about blatant market manipulation that happened today by these cocksuckers, then go ahead and take 5 minutes to file an SEC complaint about the company. I'll help you out and give you the info you need to put it before you write the detailed complaint.      Firm Name: Robinhood Financial, LLC.   Typer of Firm: Broker-Dealer  Address information: 85 willow road menlo park, California 94025  Then under security information put  Type of security: Equity Security  Security Symbol: For example, for AMC this would be NYSE:AMC, for GME it's NYSE:GME.   Name of Issuer of Security Issuer: Find official company name. Gamestop Corp. for example.      For the complaint, write it in your own words, but what they did was pure market manipulation. They cut off retail investors while allowing hedge fund investors free pickings. This can't go unchecked.
Here is the VW short squeeze chart. Huge dip before the massive cover.
IM GETTING IN AT 126‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è IF I LOSE IM MEGA SCREWED
According to mainstream media, it‚Äôs greed when working people try to make money out of the stock market... But not when the richest 10% of Americans own 87% of the stock market or when US billionaires hoard another $  trillion to add to their wealth during a pandemic.
Legality of our Current Situation
I'll start off by saying I do not have any positions in GME, I'm poor and didnt hop in when I had a chance. Sad times. That being said. I've been in AMC and as of yesterday EXPR, both being heavily shorted and both saw a wild increase in their prices. So now my question is this, this morning we watched the majority of trading platforms either "Crash" or straight up deny those stocks from being bought. Can anyone clarify for me what the definition of Market Manipulation is? Why hasnt anyone in power stepped in to discredit the major corporations in power that are causing this?
READ THIS
IM NOT 100% SURE BUT THIS IS THE TACTIC.  Let‚Äôs say they have 1,000,000 shares  For every 10,000 shares they sell, they drop the next 10,000 by $10 to the point that the stock is losing money and not being consistent as it was.   EXAMPLE:  GameStop = $1000 with a volume of 10,000,000  They sell 3,000,000 shares starting at $1000 and the next 100,000 shares after the initial the price goes down by $10 leading all the way to a lower price point for said stock.  THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION    CORRECT MY RETARDED MATH IF IM WRONG  THEY ARE JUST GIVING IT ALL TO SCARE US BEFORE THEY LOSE A SHIT TON OF MONEY BY THE END OF TOMORROW   THEIR CONTRACTS EXPIRE TOMORROW, IF GME STAYS ABOVE $200 WE WIN.  DO NOT SELL. HOLD.   I AM RETARDED, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL EXPERT OR ANYTHING. I AM ONE OF YOU. DIAMOND HANDS BROTHERS AND SISTERS
So
How many chicken tendies have ya‚Äôll lost?
They convinced apps and brokers to restrict buying today so they could close out their positions while the stock plummeted. WE WILL GET REVENGE. Good luck in the lawsuits you absolute wankers!
I want to start a GoFundMe, and file a lawsuit by EOD tomorrow.   These cunts just saved BILLIONS by convincing brokers to shut it down.
I'M FREAKING OUT! HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS TO MY FAMILY?
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the crash today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is gme dropping? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I spent all my money and my sister's money too. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought gme was going up???? This is so fucked.
GAMR ETF which is 27% GME still available on Robinhood! Won't rebalance until mid-March!
This all could‚Äôve been avoided!
If these hedge funds would‚Äôve posted their loss porn for all of us retards to beat off too we wouldn‚Äôt have so much pent up aggression. Not only is it their fault for shorting, it‚Äôs also their fault for not studying their enemy.
For The Ones Late to the Game
HOW THE FUCK DO WE BUY STOCKS IN THE US? Fuck robinhood  Help!
BOYCOTTING ROBINHOOD IS THE ONLY WAY
We will all make it thru this. People are already signing up for other brokerages. Everyone should get on top of this asap. Open accounts at TD or other brokerages that aren‚Äôt being pathetic sore loser sympathizers. Robin hood is completely fucked and bowed down to the wrong side here. They will pay for this in a way unimaginable. We will turn their backs on them. And we will prevail. GME And AMC  ü§≤. Be strong brethren.
PSA: Fidelity is still selling $GME
Class Action Lawsuit shouldn't just be for Robinhood Users
Everyone is getting fucked over by this. I use Tastyworks and they still allow (for the moment) for GME & AMC shares to be purchased. But when a large bulk of shareholders can only sell or hold there's only one way a price can go. This market manipulation impacts every single shareholder of AMC & GME.  I want in on the class action lawsuit. This is straight up theft in the largest of magnitudes driven by a company with the most ironic of names.
Third world countries. Let's all unite our autistic hands and help our friends.

It‚Äôs time to delete Robinhood after the Short Squeeze. Fuck Robinhood fuck these disgusting corrupt corporatists pricks. For now hold the line
I can‚Äôt fucking believe this. The app is literally called robinhood you would think they would be about returning wealth from the rich to the people but of course not. They are totally beholden to Wall Street hedge funds and corporations who‚Äôs entire business model is betting against other companies and other people‚Äôs livelihoods and yet they fucking shut down trading to protect the billionaires asses? They fucked us all over. They‚Äôve made it possible to sell only so that once the sell off starts people panic and sell more while the hedge funds can recalibrate their positions. THIS is market manipulation by an APP, not us. I‚Äôm done with robinhood after this. Once this is over I‚Äôm withdrawing my funds and moving to another app. I‚Äôm deleting this shitty corporate shill of an app because they‚Äôre trying to rig it against us like they always have. It‚Äôs time for an FEC Investigation and a nationwide class action lawsuit for anyone who had shares. They need to be shut down at this point. Regardless, hold the line for now, try to get through on another platform and hold retards, don‚Äôt let them win, don‚Äôt let them see that market manipulation works and that they can silence us if they own our trading platforms. I‚Äôm proud to be called a true retard alongside you all, brothers
Robinhood can never do an IPO, SPAC, or reverse merger. WSB will short that shit to oblivion for what they did today.
ALL MY AMC BROTHERS AND SISTERS üëÇ UP
We missed the hype for GME, but we are in this fight as well. They are doing this on purpose, DO NOT SELL. Once the movies open back up it‚Äôll rocket anyway, it‚Äôs a smart investment either way. HOLD THE LINES LIKE YOU HOLD YOUR WIVES BOYFRIENDS DICK WHEN HE PEES
How I‚Äôm doing my part
I have BB and NOK. I‚Äôm holding for the long haul. I‚Äôm doing my part my upvoting content encouraging people to buy and to hold forever   üèΩ
When you sell, I sell, we all sell together. This isn't about money. I don't care about money. This is about standing up for ourselves.
AMC and GME down, BUY THE DIP
I just bought a load more shares while in the dip, do not fear!   We will beat wall Street, they're trying to scare us when In reality it's them who're scared!  Holding gme to ¬£1000 Holding AMC to ¬£20
Buy into aal
Just speculating
STILL NOT SELLING    - HEDGIES GET WEDGIES
I've withdrawn all cash from Robinhood. Who else is with me?!
This shit is fucked.  Let's hit em where it hurts. Will this create a margin call on robinhood? IDK.  Will I continue to boycott their services, fuck yea I will.  Only do this with your CASH.  There is a painful $75 fee to transfer shares to another broker.  If you sell your shares now to transfer, it will only contribute to the decline in price. Dont forget that YOU LIKE THE STOCK, same as ME!  Other brokers are free & quick to set up.  I heard Fidelity allowed for 10k to trade instantly.  Eventually I will leave the platform entirely.  Obligatory I am an autist, not a financial advisor.
Melvin first, then robinhood
Robinhood wants to shut down our art down so bad, yea okay they got us for now,   MILLION STRONG. We managed to max melvins losses to the roof, and of course even more     links are available for this exact reason. Let us, speak our words, MAY A REBELLION ARISE!!!  STRIKE ROBINHOOD!!! STRIKE ROBINHOOD!!!    SEC complaint page:    Robinhood contact page:    FINRA complaint page:    Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. I am not a financial advisor. I am not a fiduciary. I am a just a retail investor.  As of this post, Robinhood has locked out buying on various stocks including GME. In my opinion, this is clear, deliberate and unethical attempt at market manipulation.  I‚Äôve left the links unmasked for those that wish to copy and paste them elsewhere. You have my permission to do so. I prefer you do not credit my username so my inbox isn‚Äôt flooded.

Well fu#  what happened huh
F$ck robinhood
I'm using Trade212, can't buy GME, BB, AMC, NOK. THEY NEED TO GO THE F DOWN AS WELL
$GME super on sale right now, if you can find a way to buy it
Everyone has been asking for loss porn. I started December 14th and have only invested $800. At peak today with only GME in hand I hit 92k. This is what it looks like now due to market manipulation. HOLD THE LINE   üèª
DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT
"Do not go gentle into that good night,  Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Stash App
Not as fast or savvy as RH, but stash app let me get in my orders when the market opened this morning. I just bought more GME, AMC, BB!
HOLDING UNTIL THE END OF TIME
VW experienced a serious dip in price before the squeeze. HOLD MOTHERFUCKERS.
Revolt blocking AMC buys and bb stock buy still pending after 3 hours.
Is this legal?
I know one of you autist has a speciality of law, is it even legal how RH are fucking us? Some of us are minors on our siblings account for gods sake!
FYI you can still buy Nokia on cashapp
wish they had gme smh  edit: I think you can still buy AMC too I just tried we‚Äôll see
A YouTube streamer is showing his apps listing gme at $237 but all my apps say $136 . They are manipulated so we will sell
This is a class war
AMC
Anyone stilling even trying for amc?!?
So when RH gets sued...
Can part of the lawsuit force them to change their name to NottinghamSheriff?
ROBINHOOD CANNOT STOP US MOVE TO FIDELITY
Fidelity allows for 10k instant deposit and is still allowing users to buy GME     . Screw those market manipulators over at Robinhood they cannot stop us
Cashapp just let me buy amc
Eat the rich üí™üèæüí™üèæüí™üèæ
Buy FAZ!
FAZ was around $60 in February, previously in the hundreds. We all hop on it will run!
Time to let robinhood know how we feel
So I know a lot of people can‚Äôt close because they‚Äôre holding, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt hit them where it hurts. Robinhood is sitting on a healthy chunk of positive reviews on the App Store that are undeserved. Let‚Äôs get them down below 3 stars by the end of the week (or sooner) and when we‚Äôre done pumping GameStop to the moon we can close our accounts
YOU ONLY LOSE IF YOU SELL AT A LOSS  - HOLD
USE WEBULL TO BUY IF U ARE USE TO USING ROBINHOOD !!!üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
you can trade all stocks on WEBULL pass the massage around ... give the ratings they deserve to Robinhood on the APPStore
Any broker that's not allowing GME, AMC, BB, etc. purchases right now should be boycotted after this.
I'm not even holding GME, but this is pissing me off (I wanted to buy GME last Friday but the Canadian account I opened on Wealthsimple has a 3 day hold on deposits because of something called "risk management").  This is just my opinion.  This is not financial advice. I'm holding 3 shares of BB, 1 of AMC.
The Only reason this is going down is because they've stopped our ability to buy the dip.
They stop our ability to buy  They push the price down to get you to sell.  Price cant go back up right now because we can't buy. Its that simple.  This price isn't the price. It's what they are trying to make it appear.
Ban Robinhood from app store, sign petition!!!
So can we file a class action suit against the brokers preventing normal people from buying stock?
Seriously, Robinhood and TD Ameritrade should have every single penny they have earned from their business stripped from them.  Fuck them for being in bed with wall street.
HOLD THE LINE BOYS, WERE IN
HOLD HOLD AND HOLD AGAIN
The dream has ended. Can‚Äôt buy or sell bc brokerages love billionaire dick in their mouths. These people deserve to rot in prison
GME available to buy on TD Ameritrade website
Saw the crash and have been trying to check options on it all morning on mobile and obviously it wasn‚Äôt working on the app. I was able to buy shares when I opened up their actual website though. Sorry if this is old news.  Note: I have gotten zero work done today trying to get on the gimp train with the rest of you retards.
Can I get a flair for not being one of the peasants who joined WSB in the last 2 weeks??
I‚Äôve been losing money in Robinhood for 2 YEARS. I was around when WSBGod turned 2000 into 4m on TSLA. Now I know there are those of you who have been here longer but at least I‚Äôm not one the   others  .
I fucking love you all
Just wanted to say it and have you know it. I am learning a lot about investing from you all.. and additionally (recently) you have brought me some renewed faith in our society.
As more and more people are restricted from their right to trade in by the likes of Robinhood and other platforms, I am here to propose my solution. A Decentralized Stock Exchange
A year ago I start production of creating a decentralized stock exchange that would allow people to trade without the median party interfering. I got pretty far in the project but I had to table it to focus on other businesses. But Since now is a better time than any to introduce this, I will offer both the video explaining how it works and the foundational code of this project to hopefully build something for the people. I expect this to be a community collaboration with the open opinions of r/wallstreetbets navigating fellow community of developers to weigh in on how they wish this project to progress! If this gets a lot of support we can turn it into a foundation where the people contribute.     The Code:       The Explainer Video:       My Documented Journey before I tabled it:  '     Mockup:
Yall toilet paper handed newcomers are probably panicking right now but I've been here long enough to not even flinch. I'll hold this all the way til it's over.
THEY ACT LIKE WE DIDN'T WITNESS
Literally thousands of people storm the capitol because they felt like something was stolen from them and think it couldn't happen to them! Remember occupy Wallstreet
NOK what‚Äôs up?
Can someone explain why NOK is dropping?
[GME] Can I get some karma for taking a bath from all you autists panic selling

Stay strong
Stay strong, I bought GME at $90 and it dropped to $60 then back up $90 then I sold. Never again. We can do this. Hold    Processing img wbxw0v9vm3e61...
It's over. Huge decline.
Get out of your position before there's irreversible damage to your profit.
So why the huge dip?
If us retail investors are, in theory, not selling $GME, why has it lost 50/60% of its value? If hedgefunds are doing it, doesnt it mean they are as well losing a lot of money?   Thanks for clarifying this issue!  Ps: Hold the fucking line!!!
Please upvote !!! You can buy on amc and nok on cash app !!!
THIS WILL HAPPEN SOON IF YOU DONT SELL NOW. HOLD. THE. FUCKING. LINE. PRESSURE CREATES DIAMONDS . DON'T SELL, THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO DO
BUY BB!!! 35% Loss today plenty of bags to be held!!!
I need tendies yolo‚Äôd on BB this morning help me with your diamond hands retards!!
Fck the hedge funds! Stay strong! üí™üèΩ
HOLD!
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
Revolut not accepting buy orders on GME
I‚Äôm trying to buy the dip and it appears Revolut no longer accepting buy orders.

I'm buying more. Diamond hands. Apes together S T R O N G  Edit: Just to be clear, this isn't advice. I just Like The Stock.
What apps are good for trading
Where do you all do your trading like I‚Äôve seen plenty of apps but I‚Äôm sure like most I‚Äôm pretty skeptical of it do y‚Äôall use websites or apps And ngl yes I‚Äôve come from all the game stop stuff figured this is a good opportunity to finally get involved
Ameritrade it is
They‚Äôre desperate and it shows.
They‚Äôre fighting dirty, pulling out all the stops. Yesterday failed to save their asses and now they‚Äôre throwing one last Hail Mary in a desperate attempt to stem the bleeding.  The longer we hold, the more they hurt. Don‚Äôt let up. Step on their fucking necks.
To the OG degenerates of wsb
Do not sell. Hold the line! I repeat hold the line!
DO NOT SELL  I WOKE UP WITH ANXIETY BECAUSE OF A NIGHTMARE AND ALL OF THIS IS WORSENING IT BUT IM STILL NOT SELLING     üèΩ
I saw this reposted a bunch:

DO NOT SELL! HOLD THE LINE! Down 60% - All because of RH.

So, who will ultimately end up in jail over this?
My guess is no one.
Yo Robinhood. IF WE CANT FUCK MELVIN, we well fuck with you. We about to cancel your whole fucking app.
Stop Selling Idiots, Buy More
This is an artificial lowering of the price by hedge fund algorithms meant to scare you into selling, DON'T FALL FOR THE TRAP. This is just a discount for us, buy MORE.
"Help me get more Tendies" - u/DeepFucking Value Part 4 of 7
huh its weird that they aren't halting trading during an absolute genocide of gme. such a joke and i bet they are laughing thinking there is nothing we can do but watch
is there anything we can do?
Fuck RH. Where are we moving?
Forgot to cancel stop loss at $200. What app can I move to? Webull won‚Äôt let me look at GME.

SEC needs to stop all trading until we are given the option to buy again
We were in a pitched battle and they took away our weapons, giving us only the ability to stay or retreat.  We are still in this - it goes back up if we can just get our fucking weapons back.
GME   NOW IS THE TIME TO BE BRAVE
Down over 20k this morning. STILL HOLDING. Remember that you haven‚Äôt lost a single penny until you decide to sell. Buy the dip if you can, and HOLD GME LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!
Diamond hands on stocks
i got diamond hands on $AMC and $NOK since i‚Äôm not able to buy $GME since everyone is fucking us over
Can't buy GME on Fidelity now it seems...
It appears I can't buy more shares of GME or AMC on Fidelity now. Bid/Ask is 0 and price is falling fast.  Anyone else able to buy on Fidelity?
Make ethical companies rich again!
I think if all of this has proved anything it's that we have more power than we thought we had.  The idea that we can reward companies that treat their workers correctly, treat the planet right, etc etc is just beautiful.  As the saying goes - hit them where it   bank accounts. Reward companies that do good, and screw everyone else. By screwing them they will be forced to change!  I know this is a very simplistic view of things and people still want to make money but anything (ANYTHING) is better than the current system.  Well done redditers, you beautiful b\ stards.
Large shareholder sells stock
IMPORTANT! DO NOT SELL, ITS MORE MARKET MANIPULATION WITH TRADES BETWEEN FIRMS TRIGGERING STOP LOSSES. 2k IS THE TRUE ASKING PRICE. DO NOT SELL.

GME suspended at 153. This is what manipulation looks like. Never forget. Hold. Buy more when possible.
Is DFV still holding GME? Wtf the plunge?!
IF WE SELL, THEN WHO WILL BUY
Hold your stonks. This is not about money anymore, it's about sending a message.  If all that you or I can do is sell, then who is left to buy the stock at a liquidated price?  Hold the line.
IBKR is doing it too
Black Thursday
What happened to the community...
Wheres everyone that said they would hold GME? Wheres all the 100k people that upvoted posts saying to hold... I thought we were in this together. I'm still holding, but i can't do it alone.
lads this is getting intense, hold me tightly and tell me everything will be okay
"NOT SUPPORTED"!? ü•äü•ä
Robinhood no longer supporting AMC, NOK, BB, NAKD, GME, &   about market manipulation) Where can I rightfully buy freely? Also, do you think Robinhood will support these again? If so, I say ROUND TWO! ü•äü•ä

Why did they halt trading when the hedge funds were losing their shirts but are not halting trading while the brokerages are clearly manipulating the market to cost the regular guy?
Fuck Wall St and everyone involved in this rigged fucking game!
TOTALLY UNFAIR YOU WALL STREET BASTARDS
So the suits are banning trades and platforms.   WHAT A FUKING JOKE  .  Free markets my ass.    We should all band together and CRASH this ponzi scheme. Shut us down because we were winning???  Let us teach them a lesson: that the POWER OF THE PEOPLE is stronger than the 1% elites.  I am going to   YOLO SHORT   this market NOW via leveraged products.   # My favorites:  SPXS and UVXY.  Only asswipes reside on Wall Street.  Lets all F them up!!!!!!

LOL they are trying so hard to break us!! But it‚Äôs all so cheap, BUYING MORE NOW
LFG !!! I‚Äôm back in on GME and still balls deep on AMC!!!!!‚Äô
Opening TD Ameritrade. Anyone got a referral code?
This was all coordinated, short laddering combined with RH blocking buys
Take a look at this screenshot:    You'll see a tiny amount of volume on the right causing insane reductions in price. This was all coordinated. They blocked buying on Robin Hood, then they went on to short ladder GME. This results in insane reductions in price from tiny volumes, with millions of people being blocked from buying the stock. This is insanely dirty.
THIS IS NOT A SELL OFF THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION
GUYS Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.  It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.  DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.  These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.  Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.  Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.  This is a repost!!!!!!
Realize where we are and where we are going...
Wealthsimple having a blast at scaring people. Scums ! Down 60% :(.
Options Expiring Tomorrow - Fraud of the highest caliber
I'm sitting on a pile of $BB call options that expire tomorrow, the restrictions placed by these brokerages hit any option holders particularly hard.  Everyone holding will likely recover a lot of their losses, but option holders are fucked.
Fuck these clowns. Not selling.
I'M IN BOIS
"It hurts, doesn't it? Look at all that loss. But we can make the pain disappear. All you have to do is sell, peasant. We still allow you to sell. Close your position. Do it. DO IT."
Nah, I'm good fam

Buy AMC NOK NAKD and help a brotha out and buy some HEMP. Hemp is the future that company must turn around eventually.
Volume is LOW - Hold!
MM are attacking viciously,   but volumes are low    -Many platforms are down which is very suspicious -GME and BB tickers buy orders are blocked on some platforms -MMs are selling at lower price to create fear and force paper hands to sell    Do not give up    Volumes are low, which means imo this is all manipulation!  This is class warfare.    this shit and buy more!!!    Friday this will go up as options expire  (Not fin advice, i'm a retard)
Institutions are having a FANTASTIC day today trading those options.
History is about to repeat itself. HOLD THE LINE BOYS

Why are you stressing! We predicted this would happen a few days ago? Stay calm and buy the dipü§≤

I DECLARE THE WSB ANTHEM!! BUY THE DIP AND HOLD!!
STAY STRONG WITH GME!
They're pulling down the price because they're afraid of tomorrow - the lowest they can bring the price down to is 0, and when they do that, WE NEED TO STRIKE! We brought the price up to $480 before, and we can do it again! This needs to be co-ordinated, everyone needs to stay strong - GME will be above 400 EOD if we stay together in this
Everyone please relax. It isn't even friday. No one can buy on robinhood so this is not retial who is buying your sales. Hold the fucking line/ get in on discount.
This is not financial advice.

Honestly,it could work if everyone did it. Also glad I don't use Robinhood. They should be sued to th ground for what they did.
I WILL NOT SELL. FUCK YOU ROBIN HOOD. IM GOING TO THE MOON. BB, GME AND NOKIA TO THE MOON!
Do not sell, there is no volume on GME today, this is just another short ladder that the citadel, Melvin and Robin Hood are doing to make the price fall. Nobody is selling, not me.
Any $BBW holders in here?
Is it normal for TD Ameritrade to review your new account for two days
I just tried to open up a new TD Ameritrade account. they said I have submitted all the information but it is under review and will take about 2 days  Is this normal?
Schwab sent me an email restricting me from trading
I was messing around with my 9 stocks of BB yesterday and I got an email saying one or more trades weren't clear under accordance of securities industry regulations and they were restricting my trading. Did I fuck up or is Schwab trying to fuck me over?
Don‚Äôt you dare sell.
They can‚Äôt stop the Buying power at their own whimsy. It is a trick and the valuation will return. Hold your spot or regret it later you numbnuts.

Any brokers allow new accounts to deposit and make purchases the same day the account is opened?
If not Robinhood censorship may cause GME purchases may lag for several days before price can continue to rise at full speed again.
Fuck you robinhood I hope you go bankrupt
I‚Äôm down like 30% right now because they stopped letting people buy BB   Fuck this and hold. We‚Äôll drive it back up   Fuck everyone of these assholes manipulating the market like this
Chapman Albin: Now Accepting Names to Build Class Action Suite Against RobinHood

Please help me buy GME stocks
Im a 16 year old Indian and my dad is blissfully unaware of the GME stock situation. I want to convince him to buy some stocks. Please help me how would I do that
What the fuck is going on why is ask price 2k
Which Brokers can Americans sign up immediately, use transferred funds immediately, and buy GME immediately?
Title says it all, only one of these 3 questions is ever answered in the other posts.  Answering all 3 is the key for Americans to get in on this anyway.
Reason for the GME price drop
Citadel just restricted all trades on GME. 40% of all trades of GME were happening via Citadel (Robinhood etc use them) which just effectively froze a massive chunk of the supply.   If you're still able to trade, DO NOT SELL. Take advantage of the price drop to BUY. Once Citadel unfreezes trading, we're going to the fucking moon. The same thing happened with Volkswagen in 08. NOW IS THE TIME. I LIKE THE STOCK    This is not financial advice
Fidelity Still Pushing Through Buy Orders!
Yesterday I bought a stock of GME. First time doing all that. HOLD the line, Godspeed from Europe!
I love what's happening, people. History is being made. Could not afford to spend more than the proce of one GME stock but, hell, every single bit counts.        Losing right now, but don't care. I was poor before, only thing I can do is improve. Fuck it all and HOLD!

$ABNB AirBNB time to shine
What a dip - been long on AirBNB since the last dip, love this morning.     Hotels are out - there hasn't been any stop on personal landlord renting out houses / rooms regardless of this pandemic. The best way to get out on vacation without dealing with 'restrictions'. The due diligence is there, just my 2 cents i think this is the stock of 2021 (along with gaming)
I‚Äôve never been so calm about my portfolio going down 55%

Melvin Capital paying RH to stop trading?
I heard this rumor online and it makes a lot of sense. If this is true, this is market manipulation at its peak. Wtf? Anyone know if this is true?
THIS WAS A COORDINATED ATTACK
This was nothing short of forced selling. Why did the shorts not get forced to buy to close out their position instead of longs being forced to sell? This is collusion and needs to be stopped. This calls for a revolt.
eToro UK closed market for GME
Fuck the market manipulation
Why do our 2 important tickers keep getting halted and then dropping $30 and then getting halted again
Is this some ACTUAL manipulation to help Melvin capital back in?
What‚Äôs happening now happened in 2008. It‚Äôs their last throw of the dice. Always  ü§≤ my brothers. We‚Äôre heading to the moon
We have more power than we realize
This will probably get lost in new but fuck it, here goes nothing.   You boys have got me and several others to redownload reddit. You boys have brought millions of people together for one cause. Sure, it‚Äôs a meme cause, but that still counts towards something.   Current day politics have people at each others throats, people are currently bracing for civil war. Unity is desperately needed in the US. Label me a conspiracy theorist or whatever you want but I have reason to believe this is on purpose. The elites and top wall street investors want people at each other‚Äôs throats. It keeps their money safe. Shit like $GME threatens their power. They want the common man to hate each other so they can keep making money and stay safe.  So what‚Äôs the point of this post? Well I believe that we could potentially change the landscape of US politics. You see how scared the Hedge Fund guys and Robinhood are. You boys have brought everyone on either side of the political spectrum together. You boys have created unity, and it‚Äôs important to keep this unity up. This could be the beginning of a shift in power. Apes together strong, it‚Äôs time for the 99% to rise up. $GME to the moon   . Let‚Äôs fucking do this boys.
If Anyone has Chase Checking Account you can instantly open chase investment account and fund your account. They are allowing GME as well.
This is war. We need your help
So many people went all in on these plays and they are cheating to take everything from us. Today we took a hit as is expected in war. Do everything you can. If you dont have  enough funds to make a major difference you have a voice. Do not let up on social media. Do not stop going after these crooks. Do not stop petitioning the bigger guns to help. We have already stormed the castle, now we must fight for our freedom. Stand together, stand strong, do not give up. We are all in this together.
Here's the Manipulation!!!
1. Brokerages  have suspended buying on the GME -- but not stock... guess why? It's to allow their friends and investors to buy. 2. The stock went to 500 in the pre market and yet is down now... sentiment has not changed so what is the price action right now? Its probably hedgefunds shorting to themselves to scare you! 3. They were not able to scare through media videos, news outlets, bots, short laddering bringing the price down throughout the day, making after market red yesterday, and so now they're trying to make the whole day red to get you to sell.  4. They're trying to get out of the gamma squeeze as much as possible for Friday, however, they still are going to get squeezed! 5. Since you can only sell -- who the fuck s buying?? the hedge funds themselves, eventually they'll run out of shares they can buy back at some artificial price -- they can't buy from themselves to cover. 6. T-2 If you sell you cannot buy back for 2 days. That means no gamma squeeze and so they're forcing you out for Monday and Tuesday as people get paid.  Call the SEC if you feel you've been wronged! clearly market manipulation because they think big money owns everything, and are against the law.   1.
PSA: This dip is manufactured
The volume is only 20 million, this is a manufactured sell-off like what to what happened post-market yesterday. Many predicted this would happen and are still holding.   This is a manufactured dip by the shorts. It will moon again.   ü§ö and hold. GME will squeeze to 5000, don‚Äôt miss out. Buy more if your broker isn‚Äôt fraudulent and allows you.   If you can‚Äôt handle the stress uninstall the app until tomorrow
IRONY OF AN APP CALLED ROBINHOOD FUCKING THE POOR
you cant make this shit up  POS 1 GME @ $60 AND 1 BB AT 20
NOK and AMC still available for purchase on Cash App
Let me stat by saying HOLD YOUR GME FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY  With that being said, since most of us are locked out from buying more, now is a good time to purchase some NOK or AMC and you can do so on Cash App still, as of now.  Use this link and I think you'll get like $10 too:

Full Interview - CNBC & Chamath Palihapitiya - January 27, 2021 (YT keeps taking it down)
Youtube keeps taking down this VERY important and VERY informative video. They've got all hands on deck today with damage control and trying to control the conversation. We must stay ahead of them. Share this wherever you can. So far I only have a google drive and vimeo link, but if anyone out there knows of other great video hosting sites that aren't on such a short corporate leash like Youtube, I'll gladly upload there as well.

DONT LISTEN TO People saying you don‚Äôt make a dent if you sell you do... you made a dent because you   are now taking each other‚Äôs money
We have won the battle against hedge funds. But we are in a war to recapture out money. Do not fight amongst ourselves. As people of the community we need to find the next target. We need to control the narrative. I present you operation Kroger. Kroger has a 2 b short on its head. Why Kroger? Kroger has consistently helped special needs and LGBT communities ( I‚Äôm talking to you gay bears.) how can the media flame a company that has helped so many people. They have 30b market cap identical float to GME. CONTROL THE NARRATIVE
Who has balls of steel: Us or Hedge funds? HOLD YOUR GME YOU COWARDS. Selling makes the situation worse.
WSB right now
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE!!!!!!!! APE STRONG TOGETHER
DONT SELL. HOLD STRONG FUCK THE SUITS
Our owners are showing their true colors.
The ruling class isn't hiding behind closed doors now. They've played their cards out in the open, FUCK US. They give no fucking shits about us, they don't want us to win, they are pissed that we can even think critically about our free market. Which is actually not so free.        Please do not falter, if you have your life savings in this I don't shame you for getting out, but the fallout of this week will ring bells in the hearts and minds of the disenfranchised citizens of the world. Come together WSB's, reddit, liberals, conservatives, EVERYONE. Change must happen.

SEC Complaint Form - time to spam the SEC with Robin Hood complaints!
Form Link:     Info you'll need:  Address:  85 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 United States   Complaint: Robin Hood is intentionally manipulating stock prices by blocking its customer from purchasing certain securities,   GME (listed in form below).  Robin Hood IS allowing these investors to sell.  This is putting immediate downward pressure on the stock price.
Who is the best lawyer to represent us in a class action suit?
We need to take RobinHood out of existence, prove that they were colluding with the short Hedge Funds, and ensure that we get the money that we deserve!  There are loads of pitbull lawyers out there....  we need the nastiest son-of-a-bitch to help us fuck these guys!
MAKE SURE TO REVIEW ROBINHOOD IN THE APP/PLAY STORE
We need to destroy that mf company.
REVOLUT
one word: Revolut   If you're not in the US you can use it. The only problem is that it can take some time to verify your account (you need to send a photo of your ID etc). Also I'm not sure if you need to wait for a Debit Card from them to start using them. This delay might affect us but I want you to know that ...     I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING
What‚Äôs up with the huge GME selloff? Why robinhood ban GME? E TRADE FTW
Did we lose?
We must stick together
Im typing this as AMC and GME are plummeting.  You have to realize, WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.  They are terrified of what we have done. They are doing everything they can to scare the noobies off.  If we want to win this, we NEED STRONG HANDS.  If you cave in and sell, they can cover their shorts and we've lost.  They have been doing this for decades making billions leaving nothing for us.  WE ARE THE RESISTANCE  WE MUST STAY TOGETHER AS ONE  DONT LET THEM SCARE YOU
Image of the VW Squeeze. (HMmmmmmm)
Im telling you this is Thursday, the day before we leave the orbit. They are playing tricks to scare you.
They tell big companies like RB to not sell the stock anymore, because they knew they would cause this dip. People buy dips, but they try to prevent them from taking advantage of it!
This isn‚Äôt over
Call your house rep Call your senator File an sec complain Do everything you can to make sure these bastards don‚Äôt get away with blatant market manipulation. The stock can go to 0 it wasn‚Äôt about the money it was about sticking it to the suits. Lets do that now
WE ARE AT THE DIP. HIT THAT BUY BUTTON (if you can)
Duck you, duck you, and duck you.
GME just dipped HARD
WHERE IS THE GME LIVE DISCUSSION
Fines cheaper than losses
What are the chances that "suits" see fines for market manipulation to be cheaper than actually losing money?
Guys I know it hurts to watch but please hold. Do y'all think it will rise again?
Who Makes the Decisions to STOP Buying?
I have no GME stocks, but have been willing people on to DO NOT SELL! But naturally if selling (closing) is the only option, then the price can only come down (unless nobody actually sells).  It got me thinking though...  With people unable to buy GME but only sell (close) shares, I want to know who actually makes this decision?  Also, is it legal?
Are we losing for is it ok?
Edit: evidently we‚Äôre ok???
$17 billion of market cap wiped in about 1 hour, just imagine what these fuckers have been doing for the last decades

We Ball
I don‚Äôt know about the rest of you but when I read  u/ssauronn ‚Äòs post this morning and a bunch of the comments. I was brought to tears because it reminded me of EVERYTHING I went through as a teen because of these scumbags! After that bitch baby cry sesh I turned on Spotify and the first song to come on by random was We Ball by Ace Hood. So dearly BELOVED I WAS MADE FOR THIS. DOUBLING DOWN ON $AMC through cash app because we won‚Äôt be silenced.
HOLD! We have them, they are deploying every dirty tactic possible, we WILL WIN, just HOLD!
Shove it Robinhood
Here's how I see it. They're going to have to unban buying GME at some point, maybe today or later tomorrow but it will happen. When it does I no longer see this as an investment, I see it as a 20 dollar fractional share of a big fat middle finger. I don't care if it goes up or down I'm not going to get rich off this anyway, I don't have enough money. But I do have a couple bucks to contribute to the collective fuck you and that's worth it.
Just make a Fidelity account to buy the sweet tendie dip

How is this remotely fair?
I‚Äôm just shocked because I woke up today and I was looking at being debt-free and now the hedge funds get to be covered but not me. I did absolutely nothing wrong and they fucked up but they get to be saved.
DO NOT SELL
The only reason GME is down is because people are selling and can't get back in tomorrow they'll be a gamma squeeze so don't sell no matter what remember if u/deepfuckingvalue isn't selling why should you
Incredible chance to get on the GME train right now if you haven‚Äôt already
Stocks don‚Äôt go down, they just go on sale.
Hold and get ready for lift off!
IM HOLDING BABYYYYY
I‚Äôm just a person who believes that ‚Äúit‚Äôs your money and you need it now!‚Äù So...
If you are one of many people trying to get your cash from robinhood, the fastest way to do so is to get their debit card, open a venmo or cashapp, link the card, send money to your very trusted family member or friend, and get them to send you the money back. From there do an instant transfer to your bank and you can reinvest in other platforms such as webull, fidelity, or if you have a chase bank account you can open an investing account and buy GME, AMC, and others.   Fuck Robinhood.
Citadel just robbed EVERYONE on this sub
NO ONE can buy GME except for their designated market makers and likely citadel who are picking up GME on the cheap and dumping it onto other brokerages.   Robinhood users can only sell which further compounds the losses suffered by every robinhood user.   We're getting robbed in broad daylight! How the fuck is this legal?
Where to move money from Robinhood?
Suggestions? My wife‚Äôs boyfriend is a dividend stocks guy and is looking really smart today.
Chapman Albin interest form available
M1 app no restrictions, buy buy buy!
GME
Get in on amc it‚Äôs a good one especially when everything opens up again too
Just purely speculation
This GME dip is pure bait. Buy up, we are so close to putting these hedges out of business
WEBULL JUST SHUT DOWN TRADING FOR $GME

Am I the k my one worried AMC won‚Äôt go back up? LOL
I‚Äôm 7 contracts deep
Let's talk about Cryptocurrencies/DLTs
Robinhood etc. stopped trading GME etc. and the stock is going down. So, the average Joe is not able to trade and make money. While the big hedge fond is now able to make a lot of money with their short positions. Let's talk about Cryptocurrencies/DLTs in order to get rid of this corrupt and manipulative system.
Fidelity or Schwab?
Hold onto your $SNDL $GME $NOK and $AMC!
Only one place to go boys!    üåïüåïüåï
DID YOU THINK YOU MISSED YOUR CHANCE, HERES ANOTHER!!!
Everyone coming in from the news, seeing what happened waiting for their chance, you lucked out this is the dip of a lifetime.  BUY THIS FUCKING DIP MILLIONS OF SHORTS CLOSING TOMORROW.  They saved all of their firepower for this moment, they knew they needed a massive landslide.  Buy this fucker up and the squeeze multiplies infinitely, BUY BUY BUY     Edit: Use Fidelity to buy
Where‚Äôs the GME containment thread
Mods?
HOLD THE LINE BOYS
THIS WAS ALL PLANNED WE ARE NOT STOPPING UNTIL WE HIT EVERY MOTHERFUCKER ON WALLSTREET
Why Would My Bank Place a House Call on My Account When the Only Options I Own Expire Tomorrow?
Have only seen a house call on calls that have been exercised. But I've exercised nothing and my call options all expire tomorrow. Is this because I hold AMC options? I have Ally banks. Never had this issue before (was able to cover the amount they told me to transfer into my account to cover the house call, so that's no problem).  Been on hold for an hour so I'm not gonna get answers from them soon, and would like to be prepared when I do if you have any advice. And if this is happening to anyone else today. Thanks!
HOLD YOUR SHARES, BUY MORE IF YOU CAN! THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME TO   üèª
Fuck Robinhood and the Wallstreet dick they are sucking. This will not be resolved today so just don‚Äôt fucking sell
The New administration is crushing those trying to change the old system...
Unite
If we get people to join AMC we can start a war that can actually beat the shorts
Sorry to sound like a retard but how did y'all screw over Wall Street?
Again, my apologies if I sound idiotic but what exactly did you lot do to cause this chaos? It's all over the internet but no one is really explaining what happened. Thanks.
List of brokers that did not disallow full trading of GME
Mine (Ally) is no longer accepting GME buys among others such as Robinhood. Which brokers are the good ones?
Flood the courts with temporary restraining orders to get this resolved today.
All we need is one judge.  We just need one judge to file a temporary restraining order, and we can force the brokers to back down as early as today.  Everyone with a lawyer friend, get it done.
Gamestop is now falling
VOICE YOUR COMPLAINT
So obviously many in here are absolutely disgusted by Robinhood actions today. They are completely trying to manipulate the market. So the simple answer to this problem is to leave a review on the App Store of your experience. We can‚Äôt let them go on with this. Protect the common people and warn them.
BUY THE DIP   üèº
I am on Robinhood so someone buy a share for me );   Position   shares @ 330  (This is not financial advise, I like the stock)
Talk me out of selling
Seriously what is the next step from here? If literally most of people who can‚Äôt even buy then what hope do we have that‚Äôll it‚Äôll shoot up? I don‚Äôt want to sell but damn it‚Äôs getting my nervous
The crash on GME is my fault guys
I've always had bad luck when it comes to   anything really. I bought my first GME (only 3) and then it started going downhill.  I'll hold my measly 3 till the end because I'm an idiot.  SORRY for buying in and ruining all the fun!
THE LOWER IT GOES THE MORE WE BUY
Fuck these guys, they think they run this shit. We the people are proving them wrong, fuck the shills who are selling. Simply hold and buy. Next week is armageddon
ALMOST THERE
TO THE MOOONNNNN
WHY YOU SHOULD STILL HOLD! (please pin @ mods)
#BECAUSE u/deepfuckingvalue IS STILL IN!
Listen up! This is how the billionaires buy back their stocks and make their money back. They get Robinhood shut down, force people to sell, then they can buy back stocks on their contracts for cheap, then sell when it‚Äôs goes to the moon again. Hold your      hands.
Robinhood alternative let‚Äôs all leave
How is this possible?
Yeah I know the rich run the game but how would the Elite stop this from happening again? Couldn‚Äôt we just do this with the next stock that gets short traded? They‚Äôd have to stop trades permanently.
BUY $AMC & HOLD! WE WILL TAKE THIS TO THE MOON
They thought they could stop us .. what they did is make us realize how much more powerful we are in numbers and together. Hold your stocks buy more amc, bb and gme and nok.
TURN OFF YOUR PHONE
I just played a game of who can hold longer (in balls deep BB & more recently GME     üåõüåõ) dont sell dont even fucking look at your phone, your app, this is the very tactic designed expertly by the big boys to separate, and make a whole bunch of soggy pant wearin paper handers to play into the fear. Forget till tmr, next week, next month  Stay strong see you in Valhalla
Canadian Mom checking in. Yes I am a reddit lurker. No I am not a bot. Yup I'm over 40. No not a MILF. Yep I bought 3 GME at way more than it is now. Hold boys and girls. Hold. This is big. This is brutal. This is important.
We are watching. Your northern neighbours are helping if they can. The international little guys and main streets are helping if they can. Remember to get to the bathroom if you feel sick, don't just barf everywhere. Keep fighting. Keep raising your voices to the abuse and corruption of these systems.  We remember the ruined families, and futures of 2008, of the years before and after.. We know who is accountable for that.     Hold tight.
Nervous as shit
Give me strength guys, I'm over here nervous as hell about the dip. Jumped on for 1st time crack at this, probably ill advised, but y'all inspired me.
WHAT DO I DO?!? GME
I‚Äôm an idiot
TANK THEIR RATINGS. SHORT THEIR IPO. ROBINHOOD IS A SCAM COMPANY BY MANIPULATING WHAT I DO WITH MY MONEY AND I DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH MY MONEY (MY OPINION ONLY)
KEEP HOLDING
GME is getting halted and the hedges are selling to each other between the halts to knock the price down. The halts are repeated to bring it down and scare the retail. On top of this, they blocked buying GME from multiple platforms so we can only sell, to manipulate it further. This is straight corruption. Fuck you Malvin, fuck you citidal, fuck you hedges. Keep holding!
Everyone keeps posting about holding AMC &GME
I‚Äôm gonna need you to disregard that and BUY BUY BUY
[Part III] I want to briefly go over $NOK financials while the market gets fisted
Hi everyone. I understand this is stressful for everyone invested in any WSB favorites, so I am putting this together to help everyone better understand why $NOK is more than a meme.  Please   discussing the $NOK situation in detail with a focus on options. If you're interested in seeing more up these, follow my profile - I'll be making these posts daily leading up to the 04 February 2021 earnings report.  TL;DR at the bottom.  As I'm sure everyone is aware, several brokerages have blocked stocks like $NOK, $GME, $BB, $AMC, etc from being purchased. Most notably is Robinhood. Prices are going to take pretty significant hits due to what is some of the most blatant market manipulation in recent history.  I just wanted to briefly discuss Nokia's financials and how they compare to the overall 5G market as we move into the future. Why? Because it's important that we understand that $NOK isn't  just  a meme, it is a real company with legitimate prospective growth.    I don't care how financially illiterate you may be, please read below. I will make it as short and simple as possible.    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # The 5G Market  First, let's take a glance at the 5G market which Nokia is heavily involved in.     Please check out     for Nokia 5G, where they have announced major infrastructure agreements.    The compound annual growth rate of 5G is expected to be \~43% from 2021 to 2027.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # Financials  Okay, now let's go over the financials for Nokia and we'll compare it to Qualcomm, one if their biggest competitors with similar books.    $QCOM $NOK   :- :- :-   Book Value $  Billion $  Billion   Total Debt $  Billion $  Billion   Repayment of Debt $  Billion $447 Million   Free Cash Flow $  Billion $  Billion   Net Revenue TTM $  Billion $734 Million     Market Value     $176 Billion     $22 Billion       What do these numbers actually mean?      Book Value - How much the company is worth based on the their assets.   Total Debt - How much money they owe   Repayment of Debt - How much they paid off in the last 12 months   Free Cash Flow - How much extra money they company has to spend on growth/development   Net Revenue - How much money they made in the last 12 months   Market Value - What the companies value is according to the market    What can we take from this data?    Nokia is  very  similar to Qualcomm in the not to distant past. Nokia has a higher book value, less debt, and relatively better FCF. Why is the market value so much lower? Because Nokia has yet to generate earnings that would encourage growth - until now.   Well, sort of. Nokia has a big day coming up next week.   They will release their Q4 2020 earnings, which will be a huge indicator about the direction they are heading.   Expectations are generally quite high, and based on recent developments with Nokia, so are mine. More exciting is that, even if the Q4 2020 earnings aren't amazing, the prospects for 2021 are pretty awesome based on new business that Nokia has acquired. Again, I encourage you to  .  Why didn't I compare it to a different 5G company like Ericsson? That's because Ericsson's books are really not comparable at all. The company is a different size, with vastly different book value (over $276 billion with $47 billion in debt). Qualcomm and Nokia have also been directly competing with each other over patents and markets since the early 2000s ( .  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  # TL;DR -    Nokia's earnings report on 04 February 2021 could mean big shifts in the companies valuation in the short term. The long term prospects for Nokia are pretty fuckin' solid, no matter what happens.      Also, fuck Robinhood and TD.       Please consider filing a complain with the SEC    .    Or file a complaint with FINRA      .    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Disclaimer and my Holdings -  I currently own 10 of  . Those are $5 Call options that expire 16 July 2021. I'll be holding these for a while  .  If you see anything wrong or something that should be changed, please let me know!   I am not a CFA or any of that, just a curious investor who likes numbers, so this is meant to be an informative post and not a recommendation.
GET SNDL WHILE ITS LOW
It‚Äôs gone up to 95 cents consistently, run it up
I LEGIT SOLD MY SHARES OF GME @ $400
Thank you retards for not selling earlier, allowing me to unload my shares at the literal peak! I am ordering an iMac at this very time, thanks to all of you!  EDIT: To all those hating: How did it feel to watch your gains vanish into thin air? Tell me more about it. üòä
Solution needed
Guys I know we are in a hard spot right now. We have already filed multiple lawsuits against Robinhood. That app will never see the light of day again. EVER. Here‚Äôs what we need to do. Everybody list in the comments what they use instead of that Garbage app and people can transfer over to those apps.  EDIT:  please upvote this so others can see.
eToro still selling GME, NOK, NAKD and others
get in and buy, hold the line boys
DFV should start his own trading app against RobinHood
With that little fortune of his and a kickstarter it might just work  u/DeepFuckingValue
IF YOU SOLD BB TODAY LEAVE THIS SUB
Bb actually has potential in the emerging EV AND CYBERSECURITY market. THE PRICES RIGHT NOW ARE AN ABSOLUTE STEAL DUE TO THE MARKET MANIPULATION TODAY. IF YOU MISSED OUT ON GME, BB IS GOING TO BE FRUITFUL. TRUST ME.  I am not a financial advisor I like this stock
Rich killing the Poor: Robinhood restricts trading on companies targeted by Reddit users
BUY NOW. DO NOT ALLOW FUNDS TO SELL CHEAP GME TO MELVIN WHILE ROBINHOOD IS HOLDING THEIR DICKS. SLURP IT ALL UP
We lost the fight. I'm losing so much money now... Thanks for the fight guys.
Robinhood just incurred millions, if not, billions in losses for its users in attempts to ‚ÄúProTect tHeM‚Äù
Cancel Robinhood. Hold GME.
The NEXT STONK GOING TO THE MOON

Were in the dip before the boom, show these fucks we have balls of steel. Lets go get our money at the top! (This is VW 2008 when a similar event happened)
Whats Interesting About GameStop is WHY it is happening.
THIS IS THE FINAL STAND. HOLD YOUR POSITIONS AND WE WIN.
Post your beginning/end Robinhood portfolios
THEY ARE DRIVING THE PRICE DOWN TO LESSEN THE BLOW TOMORROW, HOLD THE LINE
NOK and BB are down, buy the dip! Let‚Äôs get them talking about these as well!
We will break them if we just HOLD THE LINE
They are pouring in resources to try to break us.  Hold the line.
So in the end you were all fucking scammers pumping like in many other forums..
I never entered in any of those fucking pumping scams where you know the only people who wins were the first ones who bought. But this seemed different. There was a purpose on this. A reason to hold and wait until the big ones suffered. And I was caught by you and your elevated quest.  All fucking shit. The moment I entered, the stocks went down 45%. Fucking shit. I will never trust any of you scammers again.  HOLD HOLD TO THE  MOON.  FUCK YOU ALL REDDIT
Cash App is allowing you to purchase stocks!
Heads up! Cash app is allowing you to purchase NOK and AMC. But not GME or BB! What the hell gives?!
BUY GME AND AMC ON FIDELITY!!!
You can buy and sell AMC AND GME on fidelity!!! Dont sell BUY!!! I just bought the dip
FUCKING USE REVOLUT TO $AMC
SEND IT TO THE FUCKING MOON GENTLEMEN AND WOMEN
This is not WSB selling. It wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price. These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares to each   are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling. Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid.
My wife call me Scott now...
I sold 23 shares of GME on the 19th at $42. Bought in again at $90 and sold at $123. I am    . I am Scott.
MELVIN CAP IS ABOUT TO COVER
MELVIN CAP IS CLEARLY ABOUT TO COVER. They're trying to dump the stock as much as possible to reduce their losses. Volume is still SIGNIFICANTLY lower than 10-day average which is allowing them to move stock drastically with less liquidity. Also watch NFLX, PINS, SNOW, etc. as they are Melvin's longs and will probably start selling them off to get ready to cover.   IM HOLDING  EDIT: REMINDER THAT GME NEEDS TO STAY ABOVE 60 BY FRIDAY. ALSO IF DFV IS HOLDING I CAN TOO
If this is war on HFs are there other fronts to be fighting on? Or are we putting all troops on $GME Beach for VT Day (Victory over Tendies Day)?
I'm super new to this, but the war on old rich guys angle intrigued me and really pulled me in. $GME is now way out of my scope but still feel like I want to contribute to the battle in whatever small way I can!  Keep The Sand Out Of Your Weapons. Keep Those Actions Clear. I'll See You On The Beach.
Who here is going full retard?!?
GME AMC NOK are low  BUY AND HOLD!  Putting another 1k in.  FRIDAY IS COMING!  TO THE MOON
Don‚Äôt blink
Yeah, you.  The one who‚Äôs sweating, watching their GME AMC and BB.  Don‚Äôt you dare sell.  This is a stare down, blatant naked market manipulation.  They want you to be afraid.  They want you to panic.  But don‚Äôt give them an inch.  They‚Äôre staring us down, waiting for us to fold.  Look straight back at them.  We stand at the precipice.  Don‚Äôt you dare fucking blink.
HOOOOOOOOLD THE LINE!!!
Hedge funds aren't a monolith. For all we know the could've been pumping with us and now selling, leaving us out to dry.
There needs to be accountability for this blatant manipulation.
These cronies will pay a small fine for the blatant market manipulation but it‚Äôll likely be a lot less than the short squeeze that was supposed to happen. We cannot let them get away with this. This is bullshit and needs to be addressed. Call your fucking senators! We want to see jail time for these crooks.   Hold your Damn GME shares!
DELETING ROBINHOOD ONCE WE FINISH MAKING THE HEDGE FUNDS BLEED.
Thanks for the bags. Still not selling. 25 shares at $380
üëè
Everybody, sign the petition. We must bring Robinhood to justice
Hold BB?
Will it go back up or just sell now to minimize losses?
Robinhood posts message that they are protecting us from ourselves. Absolute bullshit.
I had a $500 order in over night that was cancelled this morning. Then I get this message that I am being protected from myself. Bring on the lawsuits.
The best way to get back at Robinhood? Transfer all your cash and stock to another broker! Robinhood was built by this community, they are fools to think they can continue to succeed without us.
Robinhood was literally built by WSB. Their move this morning to restrict trading on WSB related stocks is an epic business mistake of titanic proportions. Why bother using a broker if they won't let you buy what you want to buy? Why trust a broker with your money if they won't let you use it when you want to? There are a myriad of other brokers out there who now offer $0 commission trading that don't have the same draconian restrictions that Robinhood has put in place. Let the free market reign!
There are still open ruins for $GME
I‚Äôm not an advisor, I think my last post got deleted   I know there are a lot of angry people trying to hop on the train (I am one of them) I learned that SOFI has not shut down $GME. Obviously I‚Äôm not saying to buy or sell, it is crashing currently. But I thought this might bring some clarity
I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!
You heard me!
READ THIS ABOUT GME
Its normal that price is dipping deep. If u cannot buy the stock there is only one way to go and its down. But hear this: Volume in this moment (after locks) is all time   are manipulating the price go down just with few stocks. That dosent matter becouse majority is holding. Once the buy option comes back live the price will shoot up again. Even without buy option the squeeze is inevitable.
HOLD THE LINE MY BOYS AND GROW A PAIR
GME down 36 percent as of fucking now and I‚Äôve gotta say, DONT SELL HOLD THAT BITCH LIKE ITS YOUR MOMS BOYFRIENDS VIRGINITY. Test these billionaires for all they‚Äôre worth. Make their house go under foreclosure. We‚Äôve got the upper hand if we just hold. REMEMBER: we are here to listen to them bitch and moan that   MILLION FUCKING degenerates are ruining their weekend. LETS GET THE FUCK BACK ON THE TRAIN AND KEEP POUNDING THEM HARD. GME TO THE FUCKING MOON
ü©∏ ü©∏ ü©∏ RATE THEM DOWN ON GOOGLE PLAY / APP STORE
Upvote so more people see it. Robinhood and the other brokers doing market manipulation to save their daddys hedge funds. Vote them fucking down on Google Play and App Store. Hurt them where it hurts.
where can i buy GME AMC NOK and other now that robinhood wont let me
This has been posted a lot, but guess where we are right now? I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING.
Robinhood alternatives?
Alternatives to robinhood to set up a new account and buy today?
Robinhood manipulates the market. Forcing users to sell to billionaires that needed a bailout.
Robinhood restricts users to only be able to sell   buy  ask yourself.  Who are they selling to?  The billionaires who shorted and needed a bailout that is who.    How is it r/wallstreet bets gets blamed for "Manipulating the market"?   Seams to me the real manipulation is happening elsewhere.
Can we short IBKR ticker?
Lets do it
Help!
What stocks should I buy right now?
Tastyworks joining in with the BS Manipulation of GME
New af here and in stocks.
Quick easy question. Do I buy AMC right now AT $  a share???? Idk how much I would even buy help pls
THE BROKERS HAVE SPOKEN! They don‚Äôt want us to make money. I think what they want is for us to sell everything that is not $GME. It‚Äôs not a free market anymore, I bet a couple million degenerates can trigger a market crash
Not a financial advise. Just some crazy autistic thoughts
TODAY SHOWS THAT WE CANNOT EASILY BEAT THE TOP DOGS AND BIG SUITS. WE START TO WIN, THEY SHUT US DOWN IN THAT WE CANNOT TRADE GME AMC BB NOK
Just goes to show, we are very powerful. They have to FORCE us to lose cash in order to win. Today is not our today in our pocket books. But KEEP PRESSING ON IN TERMS ON LEGAL MATTERS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED!
1 Quirky Tip for Harder Hands (Hedgefunds hate him!)
Think of it like this.   There's no such thing as something for nothing.   We lost a lot of great men today. But the victory will be realized for those who hold strong.   You want the tendies? You must endure for the tendies.   For the ones who make it, we will see you on the other side.   For the ones who didn't, we spill some out for our fallen brethren.
"Help me get more Tendies" - u/DeepFucking Value Part 6 of 7
I am down   A   percent loss. Not selling jack. I am seriously considering selling my TSLA AMZN stocks worth 155k to buy GME.
Just as the title says. Should I do it? I am shaking right now. I am literally shaking. It is 1:30am in Korea. Still up to support you retards :)
I will never sell.
You can drop this 100%, I will lose all of my money for my principles, the purpose of this was for a demonstration of the problems with the stock market. We have achieved this, to all my brothers who will go down on this ship with me, I'm proud of you, we will recover. This will be a win no matter what. Hold brothers.
BUY THE FUCKING DIP - DD WHY THIS IS JUST GETTING STARTED
This is the dip of the century. Play the long game and    harder than you can imagine.     Notice 17 MILLION reduced short position. That's why this thing DOUBLED IN A DAY AND HELD yesterday. This is unheard of, and was the shorts positioning for today. This is a scare tactic to drive out retail investors and hype.  If we hold the line and drive the price up to another gamma squeeze this dip will be no different than the dips we saw last Friday and Monday after big spikes up.    We have 5 million volume on a 40% swing. I think this hypothesis is highly plausible and given the quantity of shorts in the <$100 range from yesterday they're still bleeding HARD. In theory this game of shorts doesn't do anything except slow down upward momentum. At this point the share price is high enough individuals / retail impact to the market is SIGNIFICANTLY lower, and will only be offset by this remaining viral and under everyone's eyes. There are still big whales in this with a long interest in the $25B+ vision of gamestop.  The future is bright brothers and sisters! Many gorillas strong!
Fresh content first yolo with delta paid off spend $3k bought at $  at lowest point got   shares $3k->$5,477
BLACKBERRY WENT TO COURT WITH FACEBOOK AND QUALCOMM AND CAME OUT ON TOP. THEY WILL OBLITERATE ROBINHOOD IN COURT. SEE YOU ALL IN ANDROMEDA WHEN THEY ANNOUNCE THE LAWSUIT.
Also, Robinhood knew that this would destroy their reputation. They were likely coerced into doing it by Citadel or some other big money. Robinhood doesn't have enough money to pay for all the damages, but the people who asked Robinhood to block sales of $GME and $BB do.
The Suits are OUT of ammo!
Stay strong... just buy MORE!!!
Will BB Rocket, Let's check it out...
YES YOU DUMB CRAPS! BB was hyped up before all this even happened so dont be stupid once WSB is done with gme and want to hype the next stock it will be BB. WE have been planning for this. BUY THE FUCKING DIPS! I just cant stop buying these dips because look what happened with gme, we had resistance and doubters at first and now look at it. Dont doubt our power and lets get BB moving baby time to make some tendies. If you own it, hold it, it takes time to make money.
This is the moment of truth. Hold. The Motherfucking. Line.
This is where the strength of mankind must succeed. I have seen people from all over the world come to the assistance of the Ameritard hamburger men. This is it. Hold the fucking line.    ... To Infinity, and Beyond.
Anyone else having trouble with FreeTrade deposits?
Tried depositing twice from Apple Pay and it‚Äôs taken the money but not showing in my account
Noob here, I stupidly bought tootsie roll.. What do I do?
I bought 6 shares at   it‚Äôs at   right now -33+ loss. Will I be able to hold and recover?
Make the switch? How and Who?
Obviously Robinhood is the crook, do I sell off my stocks (none in GME or AMC, missed that train) & delete the app? Can I just move them over? What app should I use, is Fidelity free?   Sorry if this sounds dumb, I‚Äôm just trying to screw over robinhood without losing too much of my invested stocks.
Fidelity app is so bombarded with account creation that it's timing out
Attempted to create an account 5 times now and keep getting no response from their server. Most likely a good sign that others are trying to get in.
My dad has been fascinated with this movement. This text is not just for me, it's for all of us.
Some big names coming out to show support. Let's hope some of them understand the short ladder that's being implemented right now to artificially lower the price.
Follow this guy's livestream, great coverage of GME stock

Damn thank you guys
You did a real good job fellers
HOLD HOLD HOLD DIAMOND HANDED AUTISTS !

DEAR NOTTINGHAM, GOODBYE.
You don‚Äôt deserve the name you carry. You built up a foundational notion made of mud that you‚Äôre for the average joe; the platform for the little man to have a seat at the parent‚Äôs thanksgiving table. Instead, you, along with your treasonous counterparts, caused thousands, if not millions, of people to lose at the profit of a handful of rich. You stole from the poor to give to the rich. What‚Äôs worse, you helped perpetuate the very cycle you swore to break. So basically, you‚Äôre done.  See, we expected this kind of spineless, ball handling by the likes of TD and other snakes. And believe you me, they‚Äôll get their just desserts. But you, Nottingham, you betrayed the very people responsible for your continued existence. You get special treatment, your own nice cozy level of class action hell, nestled right in between Leman Brother‚Äôs cage and Maddoff‚Äôs retirement plot. You may win the battle today, but the war for your head just began.   HOLD. THE. LINE.
Bought and HOLDING from New Zealand!! Be brave retards we gonna get to the moon all together as one
I'm feeling sick looking at what is happening right now. The ability to trade in a free market is at stake here.

Where else can I buy gme
I dont even care I got cash set to the side and wanna lay some more down. TO THE FUCKING MOON. Is etrade still allowing gme or no? I plan on leaving rh after the squeeze, and obviously td isnt a place I'll go either.  REMEBER APES HOLD THE LINE. IM SO FUCKING PROUD TO BE ONE OF YOU
MODS PLEASE POST STICKY OF OTHER PLATFORMS TO SWITCH INSTEAD OF ROBINTHEHOOD ONCE THIS IS OVER SO WE CAN MASS MIGRATE.
Or someone for the love of god.
Should I buy AMC rn??????????????? Is it going
GME
So we all know Robinhood fucked us but WHY did they? To protect wall street cause we‚Äôre getting rich?
Lurker here, joined just to rally GME. Using the subs FAQ to find a broker, Alpaca is listed. At this time they are not restricting what you can buy. Bought in, holding for the squeeze
Just thought I'd share, since a lot of people are not using the FAQ that was literally made by the sub.  Alpaca is listed there, I used it since RH was fuckery when I first got in.
New to this whole thing, who or what should I use to trade and invest?
As the title says I'm new and not sure where to go from here any advice would be great! Also I know not to use robinhood.
Even HTMW won‚Äôt let me trade, and it‚Äôs fake money!
For fucks sake let me fake-buy the GME dip so I can win this contest.
WE NEED TO START COORDINATING
I've been a pretty passive investor in the last week of insanity but I can't sit idly by while these crimes against freedom continue. My only issue is I'm a finance  noob and don't know what to do. My goal of this thread; to organize a coordinated response of how to proceed from here.   What apps do we switch to in order to keep investing?   Where do we file complaints to? What moves do we have left to make? Most importantly, how do we stop the hedge funds from winning?   I have zero answers but I'd be more than happy to organize our path to victory. We could do this!
EXPERT DD ANALYSIS, HOLD HOLD HOLD

Do your part and drive home the message that this is bullshit. I‚Äôve always hated RH for being a shitty platform, didn‚Äôt expect them to jump on the manipulation train. They need to get fucked.
any chance rh and every other firm will lift their restrictions on $amc $gme etc today and it‚Äôll bounce back up or

Still able to buy GME on eTrade
I‚Äôm still able to buy GME on eTrade. Don‚Äôt believe the listed price. I put in a limited order (it won‚Äôt accept market order) at 30% OVER list price and the order took a long time to fill. There‚Äôs just no supply out there hence the list price is not accurate. Hold the line. Buy more if you can.

Never done stocks or anything similar in my life, where and how should I get started?
What is going on?!
Can someone please compile a list of the best Robinhood alternatives? I am not as familiar with other apps since I primarily used Robinhood, but fuck all that noise. Time to go elsewhere.
Imagine being a paper handed puss. The squeeze has yet to begin and ppl are willingly losing their money haha.
I wish I could by all these low ass shares but rh fucked me good.  Not worried though cause it‚Äôs still gonna go to 1000 whether you believe it or not, no way Melvin smelvins getting away from this.
CLASS ACTION AGAINST ETRADE. I was a BEAR a few minutes ago and attempted to put in a sell order. It was rejected because they said I did not have enough shares in my account. I still have more than that amount of shares in my account
Etrade lent out my shares to someone and wouldn't let me sell.
What is a realistic prediction for the rest of today and tomorrow?
It's all fun and games just shouting HOLD!!, but really, some people are set to lose a lot of money if this doesn't rebound.   Can someone with any real idea about what's going on please give their two cents?
How I feel now after spending all my savings on GME at 410
Volkswagen had a similar dip before their rocket ride!
History is a good lesson to learn.
NOW THEY ARE DOING MARKET MANIPULATION. LOOK HOW ALL THE SHORT INTEREST STOCKS ARE GOING DOWN.
Shoutout to FIDELITY!! üóΩ üóΩ
Real story, been a customer for over 2 years. One night it was a Sunday at like 11pm EST, immediately preceding a Monday federal holiday and I had a large pending transfer I needed to cancel absolutely asap. And real shit, I was off the phone with a friendly and polite US customer service rep in 30 seconds with a successful cancellation email. At 11pm on a banking holiday weekend.   Can‚Äôt speak for RH‚Äôs actual customer service people, but Fidelity‚Äôs are the best in the business. Good support at their in person centers too. I‚Äôm a treasurer for a non-profit that has a corporate brokerage account with them and they‚Äôve never charged so much as a single fee.   Fidelity has been one of the few brokerages today that I also haven‚Äôt seen any limiting of securities from. I already closed out of all my rh positions and got approved for options in about an hour. Deposits available to trade instantly afaik.  Obviously pick a brokerage that suits your needs, but my loyalty rests with Fidelity. Fuck Robinhood!!
The only money I have left in the world is in my IRA, which I've had for the last   years. I think it's time. To death do us part, my lovers.
WE LIKE THE STOCK APES TOGETHER STRONK
FUCK ROBINHOOD THREAD
Fuck Robinhood!

I like the stock. I own the stock and wish to purchase more.

I've lost 40 grand in 3 hours. That's everything to me. I have 1/29 200 calls so I'm horribly scared that things won't go back up in time for me.   Please for the love God don't sell while I'm out.

ROBINHOOD IPO?
kinda new to this but, i heard robinhood was creating an ipo. can we short sell them as payback? bleed them dry?
ThinkOrSwim. Transfer your account to them or E Trade. Robinhood fucked over GME today, don‚Äôt give them your service.
These fuckers dropped GME from 500 to 120. Why? Cause the people they sell data to are losing money and they can just flip the switch.  It‚Äôs fucking stupid this is allowed.   Im still holding I don‚Äôt care about the profits at this point.
DON'T TURN ON EACH OTHER. THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT WITH THE ROBINHOOD OUTAGE. STRENGTH IN NUMBERS. HOOOOOOOLD

WEBULL COVERING ACCOUNT TRANSFER FEES FROM ROBINHOOD
Enough said
A personal experience of short selling
During the financial crisis and on the run up to the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008.  I noticed the degree to which the hedge funds can essentially make the market at the cost to many.  I used to work for a UK bank and on leaving in 2007, had some ¬£17k in shares.  I always took the view, as many others did, that the banks were "too big to fail".  In a normal market that was likely true but without the uptick rule or it's equivalent, when a stock is on decline a short position is clearly going to be advantageous to those with capital they are prepared to lose.  I tried to arbitrage my shares as they declined and spread my money across the various UK banks.  It seemed peculiar that each day the share price would rise until 3pm GMT (when the Dow opens).  Then all of the days gains would be eliminated and the day closing price would be lower than at the start of the day.  Then I watched the ticker for the various UK banks and could see a major short position was put on at 3pm every afternoon for days or weeks, by a major US Hedge Fund (probably not the only one).  The short position was closed at   GMT when all UK trading was due to stop.  Essentially the hedge funds who had gained from the Mortgage market collapse were now betting on the failure of the UK banks.   I guess they eventually won, given the results.  It's easy to kick a share when it's down, the more you kick it the less chance it ever has of getting up.  The rich get richer and the poor or uninformed do nothing.  So glad to finally see a real attempt to level the playing field, keep it up!
Nokia makes a nice phone
I'm just saying.
HOLD THE LINE! The reason they restricted purchase is because they want us TO SELL and prevent us from buying this MANIPULATED DIP
DOWNLOAD A VPN RIGHT NOW U RETARDS!!
you can still trade gme in other countries like canada, so download a free vpn, put that shit in canada and buy the fuck out of gme while it‚Äôs still on sale.
Who's pulling their money out of Robinhood?
RH is 100% going to be investigated for this. Only allowing sell orders on a stock? Completely illegal.  Where to next? Fidelity? Charles Schwab?
GME TO 100‚Ç¨
When you hear about a stock on the news, you might be a little too late to the party. #Autism
Apparently Robinhood now "no longer supports" any stocks with significant short interest, including Bed Bath and Beyond and American Airlines
GME GANG DONT GIVE UP YET WE GOT THIS     WE NEED TO GET TO THE MOON AINT NOBODY STOPPIN US üìàüìàüìàüìàüìàüìàüìà
Robinhood is exactly the opposite, taking from the poor and giving to the rich
Doing this will get harder. Hedge funds are getting out of single stock short positions like they were poison. WSB has permanently changed the market.
To be clear, they can‚Äôt get out of their shorts instantly.  I don‚Äôt know where GME goes next. But the big firms aren‚Äôt going to put themselves in this position again anytime soon.
NEVER SELLING FUCK YOU ROBIN HOOD
FYI Huge Reddit outages occuring
Unreal.
GME DOWN TO 130$!
Why I'm not worried.
Ride the dip and keep your
Just got some more $GME and $AMC. Wall st.     ain‚Äôt gonna scare me. Gorillas strong
AMC needs support. We need to group tight together.
The manipulation has dropped the stock by 60%, and now it‚Äôs still early enough to join the gang. Please group up tight and buy/hold.
GME is done. We need to regroup and short squeeze SPCE
As the second most shorted stock and available for trading everywhere, we need to take action and keep the ball rolling. GME and AMC are done obviously with so many traders unable to trade the stock. Fuck Robinhood and Wall Street. We need to keep making our statement. Short squeeze SPCE and buy as many shares as you can.  Positions: 312 SPCE Shares  SPCE $51     2/5 C
CANADA READY TO FIGHT" PUT SOME MORE BUY ORDER AROUND 126 USD. IT IS NOT GOING DOWN TODAY MOTHAFUCKER SOME MORE IDIOTS ARE COMING. MAYBE THEY SHOULD WONDER WHY SO MANY RETARDS ARE JOINING THE FIGHT
MAYBE THEY SHOULD WONDER WHY THE PEOPLE ALL FUCKING OVER ARE PUTTING THEI FCKING MONEY ON THIS GME STONK, MOTHAFUCK WEALL GOING TO THE MOON THEN FCKING PLUTO MOTHAFUCKA
‚ÄúLong stock positions will require 100% margin and short stock positions will require 300% margin until further notice,‚Äù Interactive Brokers said in a statement.
GME average volume is down   shares since yesterday.
Please hold fellas. Everyone is selling because they think we‚Äôre ducked but this is just another short attack/ market manipulation right? I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of individuals saying ‚Äúfun while it lasted‚Äù or ‚Äútake your money and leave‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just sold‚Äù. Do us all a favor and go fuck off if you‚Äôre selling. We here at WSB have iron balls and diamond hands. We‚Äôve got this boys, do not let them divide us
Make sure you screenshot your loses in GME, AMC, BBBY, BB, NOK, etc. on Robinhood if you have them! It will come in handy when lawsuits are filed against Robinhood for market manipulation
Take screenshots of your positions on Robinhood.
Where is the GME thread?
I need to see a ton of people telling me to hold so I can still feel the magic!
NO CIRCUIT BREAK ON GME? Ask yourself why when it was going up it was CIRCUIT BREAKING everytime. HOLD!!! DONT SELL!!!
HOLD THE LINE
THESE TARDS IN SUITS THINK THEY CAN BEAT US?  WE DO NOT SELL  WE DO NOT WAIVER  WHEN THEY OPEN BACK UP WE HAMMER THE STONKS $GME $AMC $NOK $BB
ITS GOING BACK UP!!!! HOOOOOOOLD
KEEP HOLDING
Y'all, we knew this was going to happen. Don't freak out and stick to the plan. They're doing everything they can to drop the price. If anything buy more while it's lower. I just submitted an order on Fidelity and got part of it fulfilled for GME
I just submitted an order for 10 more shares in fidelity and only 3 got filled. That means that there are more buyers than sellers and this stock price decrease we are seeing is artificial and temporary... As long as we don't all panic sell. Tough it out, log out of the app, hide your phone up your ass, whatever. Do. Not. Sell. That is what they want
Would tanking robinhoods rating in app store help?
It would help convince people not lut money in this piece of shit app
DO NOT FUCKING PANIC SELL
IF YOU SELL THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE WINNING AND WE ARE LOOSING $AMC TO $30 $GME to $1000 $NOK to $25 LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THE BEAST IS CORNERED! CONTINUE TO HOLD!
Short shares available 9000. This is their last play  The beast is cornered.  THIS IS CLEARLY MANIPULATED.  HOLD THE LINE!  If there is a ladder attack they need to un-do their actions before of the trading day! It'll spike back.
LET IT BE KNOWN. ROBINHOOD BROKE BEFORE WSB DID
FILE A REPORT AGAINST EVERY TRADING PLATFORM
I personally use thinkorswim. I receive alerts all day long pertaining to anything that is effecting stocks. I received no alert whatsoever from TDameritrade that robinhood was blocking opening trades on certain tickers.  Any shareholder in any of these tickers is going to be at a loss as a result of them stopping incoming buys on (correct me if im wrong) the biggest retail trading platform. I take into consideration that everybody will be able to purchase any ticker while I analyze risk before taking any trade.   They interfered with the law on multiple stocks that many of us had exposure to. How is this legal? All platforms who sent out no warning to its clients that this obstruction of justice was taking place must be held accountable. We must treat this with urgency.
Help a dumb lurked transfer assets off from Robinhood.
I have a fidelity account from long time job 401k and want off Robinhood quick.  To transfer is Robinhood titled as Robinhood Securities LLC? And obviously it‚Äôll take time to transfer the assets, can I still sell and buy from Robinhood until the transfer is complete (even though they‚Äôre blocking half of my shit)?  Or any other suggestions for an idiot like me?
Sofi cut us off GME as well!! 10k GME or die trying!!!!!
Has anyone found where to buy more ?
Is GME And AMC closed from trades across all platforms?
We hold and buy, this is just a battle in a war. We win today and they are seriously depleted on resources and ammo. Hold. Buy. Beat wallstreet. Win the war.
We need deepfuckingvalue now more than ever. Are you holding sir? You must give us hope

Oh and I love the 5 min halts every time it jumped. But they let it drop without a single pause.   Why can‚Äôt I buy at 125 üò≠üò≠üò≠
Anyone try searching for gme, amc, bb, nok on   are not coming up in the search report. They are hiding these stocks!!!

Should I do it
I‚Äôm thinking about taking my IRA and buying GME. What do you think, do I send it boys?
We are right here, hold and squeeze!
REPOST: DON'T SELL, DIP IS FAKE
not a financial advisor   GUYS Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.  It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.  DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.  These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.  Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.  Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.  This is a repost!!!!!!   not a financial advisor

This is the reality. Those big guys had the choice of manipulating the market and paying a fine or going bust.   From tomorrow, we‚Äôre going back to business as usual. In 5 years they‚Äôll be convicted, pay their 10 million fine and life goes on. Some business schools will have written a case on GME.  This is the reality we have to deal with.
STAY STRONG, HOLD!!! MARKET SEEMS TO BE CRASHING! ROCKET MAN
I don‚Äôt know why my post didn‚Äôt go up earlier here is a way to see GME still not possible to buy though because of RH‚Äôs market manipulation tactic
I need a new brokerage app or service
Hi all,  Admittedly I was never going to go all in onto a GME position, however, I am no longer confident in Robinhood's service. My money does not feel safe. Can someone recommend a good brokerage app to use that will not single out specific stocks? I am already feeling dread over reopening the same positions I have on Robinhood onto another app.   Any suggestion would be great.   Thanks on advance.
SAY IT WITH ME!!! IM NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!
Everyone can file SEC complaints for the actual market manipulation that‚Äôs going on right now here‚Äôs the link
Ridicolous volume for selling orders, this is blatant market manipulation. I‚Äôm still not fucking selling.
War is not over
Those fucking Wall Street cunts are blatantly manipulating the market today.  First off restricting trades, even the stock market is halting AMC trading.  They think that they can double down their short positions and drive the price down so we will be scared, but fuck them, I am a retard and I am not scared of them because of being retarded.  Disclaimer: this is not financial advice as I'm just a cunt that pees his bed.  Positions or ban: GME 200 shares bought back in September.  AMC 200 shares. 3 calls strike 5 and one strike 18.  Doubling down today in AMC
BB IS FALLING WE CANT LET THIS HAPPEN! WE CANT LET THEM WIN THE SHORT

The stocks Robinhood is limiting to position closing only are $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG

GME bid is at 190 and the ask is at 5000. What does this mean? I'm in the red btw because I bought at 300 but I don't give a fuck and will join you all retards in this revolution.
REMEMBER ITS ABOUT THE MESSAGE ,DONT GIVE UP NOW
HOPD THE LINEESSS STAY STRONG SOLDIERS
I feel like every one in the media,stock brokers and hedge funds have merged hands to bring down $GME stock, while claiming wall street bets is manipulating the market. Hypocrisy and Manipulation in the purest form.

üö®MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WILL READ ALL DAY: $AMC/NOK/BB/GME/NAKDüö®
It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).  Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.
Someone list some apps or sites I can still buy from.
This has gotten real. Hold the line and buy the drop. Need some avenue to spend my rage cash.
Just bought more !
GME        .... HOLLLLLLLLLLD !
Hargreaves Lawson and Trading 212 VS. UK banks
I had accounts on both and trading 212 have legitimate commuting daylight fraud. HL jumped o  the train  too with their fill/kill only option. Absolute scums of the earth. Turns out my own bank allows to trade NYSE stocks and after asking about AMC, NOK, BB and GME they said you cam buy whatever you want. Their fees are high but you can still buy and sell shares.
What to use instead of robinhood?
I literally just learned about this shit yesterday when it started blowing up on the news, and I applaud you all. This is amazing!! And now I‚Äôm super interested. For someone with almost zero knowledge, where do I begin? What app do I use? I understand that it may be too late for GME and AMC, but I am interested in other options as well. Any help is appreciated.

Letter to my congresswoman... Please write your reps.
Hello Ma'am,  I hope this communication finds you well. I am a veteran, 8 years of active duty service, husband, father of 5, of African and latino decent. I do not come from a wealthy family nor do I know my families history. Much of it is a mystery as my ancestors did not originate from this country.   I work hard and am a law abiding tax paying citizen. I have been working really hard to create opportunities for my children to achieve their dreams and live the lives that were not possible for my wife and I. I save, work, save and work. I learned that investments are the way to create generational wealth and opportunities. This creates the opportunity to pass down private equity.   Recently, I series of unfortunate events have occured in my personal life that is set to put us back into the poverty... My insurance company is attempting to cheat me out of a claim for a leak that caused extensive damage in a home we purchased and haven't lived in for more that 5 weeks... However there was a glimmer of hope. I got lucky and invested in the right stock opportunities that appear to be on a surge. This is an opportunity to amass a small amount of wealth, for a common person. However this wealth is being taken from me, a private investor, living paycheck to paycheck by a company, ROBINHOOD, who has and is supporting large hedge firms or OTHER by limiting the investment opportunities for us, the people. They have halted all ability to purchase shares for the stock GME. Robinhood offers no explanation as to why this is happening except, "volatility". So what? The market is volatile, as our political landscape and current state in the economy. There are risks associated with everything.   There are millions of investors who are being stripped of an opportunity to become wealthy financially due to this egregious halt in trading GME. I am not sure what power you have to raise the awareness that this company is manipulating the market but I figured I would try. I filed a complaint with the SEC as well.   Have a blessed day.  For WSB: All of these things are true here. I am just trying earn a living here man. Please write your reps.
Bought 1000 more $BB, if you‚Äôre debating on doing a YOLO play, NOWS THE TIME
ALRIGHT YOU FUCKS LISTEN UP  BOUGHT 1000 MORE $BB  IM NOT FUCKING SELLING EVER and sure as FUCK not when a hedge fund wants me to  BB & GME ALL THE FUCKING WAY          CURRENT POSITIONS $GME- 200 $BB- 3000

Basically what the title says. In the US and trying to buy stock, what can I use to do that?
Can someone explain to me what the fuck is happening

Can anyone tell me a reliable trading app that is currently allowing new accounts to be opened????
Please
Clear manipulation on GME from level 2 data
Sorry for the potato quality but I took this during a halt. Look at the insane spread between the ask prices, retail isn‚Äôt selling.  As soon as the halt ended look at this insane sell wall, it was up briefly to cause another halt and then removed. This is insane and needs to be shared everywhere.

To the CEOs of Robinhood, Vladimir Tenev & Baiju Bhatt,
You officially screwed yourself. The entirety of the American people despise you and will run you into the ground with lawsuits. You ruined your life's work and I hope it feels good to sleep at night thinking about what you did for greed.     Sincerely,  The entirety of the American people     Note: This is not financial advice, please make these guys' names known so we can expose them for who they really are.
Going out to buy a new console
Seeings how wallstreet fat cats can just shut down buying stocks I'm going to go out and get myself a nice shiny new console from gamestop.   If we can't buy stocks then we can increase profits right? There's nothing a broker can do to stop you from spending money on retail goods from a retail business.   Only question is: which game console and games should I get?
Robinhood playing for the Big Guys
From 120k to 12k but diamond hands i guess
Guys help where is the sell button??
I am trying to find the sell button but I don‚Äôt know where to find it?? Is it next to the BUY MORE $BB $NOK $GME $AMC button?
How many of you actually bothered to close your Robin Hood account today? Or will you let RH IPO and become millionaires themselves?
Or are you going to just sit there and take this ass fucking by Wall Street? I closed my account this morning.  They are going to IPO in a few weeks, and everyone at Robin Hood is going to become millionaires because you sheep can't get your shit together and close your accounts?  Close your accounts and fuck their shit up. Fuck up their IPO and make sure the CEO and all their employees don't become millionaires by fucking us over.
Deepfuckingvalue is still holding, and you should too
"The night is the darkest just before the dawn"    Don't let their feat tactic get to you. DFV is showing us the way with his action. HOLD.
I've lost 600 so far but I'm still holding. Let's stick it to these fucks!
BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD.
IT'S HIGH TIME TO BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD!!!   TRANSFER (DO NOT SELL) YOUR SHARES AND BUYING POWER CASH TO ANOTHER   WEBULL, CHASE, FIDELITY, E\ TRADE, ALLY, ETC!     BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD AND SHOW THEM THE LITTLE GUYS CAN CHANGE THE RIGGED SYSTEM!
LITERAL TIME MACHINE
You have been handed a gift. Do what you will with it.
Keep it coming, the best part of the rollercoaster is the drop. #Hold4Ever
FOREIGN MARKETS HAVE OUR BACK
Foreign markets don't use Robinhood. All kinds of famous people are watching and coming together in solidarity. Sit tight, we knew this was going to get wild. A massive lawsuit is on the way. Find a new trading account ASAP. Whoever buys now will have a massive upswing tomorrow when people have the ability to buy again.
Where is the halt on trading now?
As of typing this the stock has dropped $237 -> $132 in a matter of 20 minutes or 55%! I thought halts happened if changes +/-10% or greater were experienced within a 10 minute timeframe?
I don‚Äôt know why my post didn‚Äôt go up earlier here is a way to see GME still not possible to buy though because of RH‚Äôs market manipulation tactic
TICK TOCK ROCKET TO NOK!
GET IT WHILE ITS LOW! IM EXPECTING A YACHT NEXT WEEK
I will never sell.
You can drop this 100%, I will lose all of my money for my principles, the purpose of this was for a demonstration of the problems with the stock market. We have achieved this, to all my brothers who will go down on this ship with me, I'm proud of you, we will recover. This will be a win no matter what. Hold brothers.
HOLD THE LINE
Buy the fucking dip
OWNERS OF ROBINHOOD ARE ALSO THE OWNERS OF MELVIN CAPITAL. DONT GIVE INTO THE FEAR BEING INDUCED. We're on the moon, Uranus is within arms reach. Hodlllllll
Hold my bully boys hold.

Ommgggg please help, I spent my life savings on this, are we still going to the moon? Is this the squeeze,? Did I miss the sell?   pleas fly again
I don‚Äôt know why my post didn‚Äôt go up earlier here is a way to see GME still not possible to buy though because of RH‚Äôs market manipulation tactic
Open letter to NASDAQ and SEC
Hey you uncorrupt beautiful human beings,   I would just like to ask, to NASDAQ firstly, why did you want to halt trades for GME if they seemed ridiculous then not halt them now when the price is ridiculously dipping?   Also, to the SEC, why are you reading this post instead of looking into why every single major trading app that refused to allow us to buy GME?   That is all. I‚Äôm sure you all are stand up human beings not under the pockets of the hedge fund managers and totally aren‚Äôt scum that will definitely do the right thing.
DON'T LET THE DIRTY FUCKING TACTICS SCARE YOU INTO SELLING!!!
Found this on the Yahoo finance board by a used called "Andrea":  Look I feel I need to break this down especially for new people. The Float is 34 million shares because Cohen bought 13% with the option to go to 20% however he publicly has not came out probably due to this all out war. Anyway that leaves a tradeable float at 34 million and you have 71 million shares short. Then you NOW have   million CALLS all IN THE MONEY. That's 220 million shares so the market makers and others are net short this stock 291 million - 34 million float for a total of 257 million net short. There is NOT enough shares to go around plain and simple. The float is shorted by about 8X and they are completely stuck. They are doing everything to talk this stock down through media, print, TV internet even these boards are full of these paid shills to get you to sell. It's all a scare tactic. They stopped selling the CALLS today because they finally looked at the numbers and had a epiphany of how bad it really is. Ameritrade stopped trading in it. It's a HUGE game of manipulation and you know what I AM NOT SELLING. These funds that wrote the CALLS and shorted the stock are liquidating a lot of other positions to bring this down. Don't get manipulated by them. These shares are golden and soon you will be able to name your own price.
BB RALLYING GROUP (We like this stock)
I know I know, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy anything but GME‚Äù is the notion that‚Äôs been going on. But BlackBerry is a great investment, and an even better one right now with the dip that‚Äôs affecting us all. BlackBerry no longer sells phones and are shifting their views to software and cyber security. They have a huge Amazon partnership and their partnership with Baidu is only gonna implement them in a better position in the near future. Outside of giving it to the shorters, BB looks primed to rise in the future. Selling right now is NOT THE MOVE. BUY THE DIP. This company is going to grow by the EOY and beyond! WE LIKE THIS STOCK. I‚Äôve lost almost 1,000 right now on BB but I‚Äôm gonna double down and buy 50 more shares once I find an app that allows the purchase of the stock. BUY GME, BUY BB, WE LIKE THESE STOCKS. SELLING IS FOR LITTLE TODDLERS.
Join It
Just google Ruqqus‚Äã
The stocks Robinhood is limiting to position closing only are $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG

holding üòîüçø
tomorrow will be better
Y'all, we knew this was going to happen. Don't freak out and stick to the plan. They're doing everything they can to drop the price. If anything buy more while it's lower. I just submitted an order on Fidelity and got part of it fulfilled for GME
I just submitted an order for 10 more shares in fidelity and only 3 got filled. That means that there are more buyers than sellers and this stock price decrease we are seeing is artificial and temporary... As long as we don't all panic sell. Tough it out, log out of the app, hide your phone up your ass, whatever. Do. Not. Sell. That is what they want
Out $545 in GME and AMC. not upset about losing the money, more upset about how the Everyman can‚Äôt do what the rich have been doing consistently. How is this not a bigger topic in media???
Anyone try searching for gme, amc, bb, nok on   are not coming up in the search report. They are hiding these stocks!!!
Bought 1000 more $BB, if you‚Äôre debating on doing a YOLO play, NOWS THE TIME
ALRIGHT YOU FUCKS LISTEN UP  BOUGHT 1000 MORE $BB  IM NOT FUCKING SELLING EVER and sure as FUCK not when a hedge fund wants me to  BB & GME ALL THE FUCKING WAY          CURRENT POSITIONS $GME- 200 $BB- 3000
Give me tendies or give me death
Just bought more !
GME        .... HOLLLLLLLLLLD !
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big club, and you ain‚Äôt in it!‚Äù Yellen makes $292,500 from Citadel speech.
Make sure you screenshot your loses in GME, AMC, BBBY, BB, NOK, etc. on Robinhood if you have them! It will come in handy when lawsuits are filed against Robinhood for market manipulation
Why the fear, guys? I am more than ready to buy if it falls below $100, even down to $50
Remember YOLO!!!
DONT SELL, LOOK AT THE LAST SHORTSQUEEZE!!!
Imagine being a paper handed puss. The squeeze has yet to begin and ppl are willingly losing their money haha.
I wish I could by all these low ass shares but rh fucked me good.  Not worried though cause it‚Äôs still gonna go to 1000 whether you believe it or not, no way Melvin smelvins getting away from this.
IMPORTANT: THERE ARE ONLY 5000 SHARES THAT NEED TO BE BOUGHT FOR GAMESTOP TO BE $400. DO NOT PANIC SELL. MOST OF THE ASKS ARE $400 AND ONLY THE SHORT ATTACK IS DRIVING THE PRICE DOWN.
Do you think GME is actually a good investment at these prices?
Or is it just about burning the shorts?
OPEN A FIDELITY ACCOUNT
FUCK RH OPEN A FIDELITY ACCOUNT, DEPOSIT A CHECK, AND GET THAT GME BABY

I'm a new retard and have a bid/ask question
GME bid is at 190 and the ask is at 5000. What does this mean? I'm in the red btw but I don't give a fuck and will join you all retards in this revolution.
GME & AMC CANT BE BROUGHT SO STOP SELLING TO SHORTERS. GME BOYS THIS IS OUR TIME!!!
Even HTMW won‚Äôt let me trade, and it‚Äôs fake money!
For fucks sake let me fake-buy the GME dip so I can win this contest.

We need you to lead us. Where are you DFV. What is happening to your army of retards? Fuck Robinhood and fuck HedgeFund bois!
Someone list some apps or sites I can still buy from.
This has gotten real. Hold the line and buy the drop. Need some avenue to spend my rage cash.
CANADA READY TO FIGHT" PUT SOME MORE BUY ORDER AROUND 126 USD. IT IS NOT GOING DOWN TODAY MOTHAFUCKER SOME MORE IDIOTS ARE COMING. MAYBE THEY SHOULD WONDER WHY SO MANY RETARDS ARE JOINING THE FIGHT
MAYBE THEY SHOULD WONDER WHY THE PEOPLE ALL FUCKING OVER ARE PUTTING THEI FCKING MONEY ON THIS GME STONK, MOTHAFUCK WEALL GOING TO THE MOON THEN FCKING PLUTO MOTHAFUCKA
Long time lurker, but what Robinhood did today, I am buying!
I am now buying, I am in this. They want to scare us, instead they made me more confident. Buying and holding GME so I can reach the moon with everyone else!!
CLASS ACTION AGAINST E TRADE. I was a BEAR a few minutes ago and attempted to put in a sell order. It was rejected because they said I did not have enough shares in my account. I still have more than that amount of shares in my account
Etrade lent out my shares to someone and wouldn't let me sell.
Robinhood's user agreement explicitly states that they "may at any time, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Me, prohibit or restrict My ability to trade securities". This is absolutely fucking outlandish. The only way to fight this is through a class action suit. STAY VIGILANT.
Realistically, when can we expect the traders to take off this ‚Äúsell only‚Äù thing? Will a lawsuit have to come first?
NOK TO THE MOON, JUST BOUGHT 420 SHARES AT $  LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO
Don't care if GME goes to 0. I'm proud to stand here with you.
Just wanted to say how fucking proud I am to be a part of this moment in history.  Mods, you're doing an incredible job managing all of this madness.  This is not over yet. The only reason this sell off is happening, is because people can sell but not buy. Simple maths.  I don't give a fuck if GME goes down to 0. I'm holding these shares and Melvins going to have to grab it from my cold, autistic dead hands.     Positions:   103 GME shares   1300 BB shares   1000 AMC shares
HOOOOLLLLLDDDDDD HOOOLLLDDD hold GME
UK - Capital [dot] com - rejecting sell or close on dummy trade
Just to be clear - I am HOLDING, HOLDING, HOLDING but I tested a buy and sell on the dummy platform as GME still seemed to be for sale through them.  It's rejecting closing and selling GME as "pricing for this market is currently indicative". Does that mean I'm never going to be able to sell unless it's at a price they are happy with?? I'm still holding - I just want to be clear on how much they are screwing me.
IM TURNING MY PHONE OFF. WE HOLDING UNTIL DEATH.        AMC GME BB NOK. FUCK EVERYBODY SELLING.
HOLD AND KEEP THE FAITH. PATIENCE. WE CANNOT LET THEM HANDLE US LIKE THIS. AMC TO THE EXOPLANETS!!!!!
We finally found a pathway to true change and it's going to be because of you guys.
I literally don't fuckin know why this keeps getting removed.  I'm not sure very many of you are going to see this but I just need someone to hear what I have to say:    THE WORLD IS FINALLY PAYING ATTENTION.    2008   was caused by some of the grossest malpractice by Wall Street firms I   have ever seen, and I swear to god I was convinced that some sort of   regulation was finally going to happen and the people responsible for   the fuck up would finally see some sort of justice.  BUT   NAH. The world literally just moved on. Sure the SEC banned CDOs and   over-shorting but as we all know, that did absolutely FUCK ALL. Hell   there was a whole movie made starring some of the biggest actors in   Hollywood detailing EXACTLY how far up your ass these firms and banks   rammed their dildos, but people decided it was too convoluted and too   difficult to understand, so AGAIN, nothing changed. There was no   widespread call for reform, nor any realistic effort at all to make sure   it never happened again.   BANKS TO THIS DAY ARE STILL TRADING CDOs  .  Fuck   was I cynical before all this. I swore that people only cared for   themselves and that if they were comfortable they were complacent. But   holy hell guys, this time it's different.   WE HAVE FINALLY PAVED A PATHWAY TOWARDS MAKING A TRUE DIFFERENCE.     Occupy Wall Street had our level of conviction, but not the knowledge   to direct it anywhere meaningful. But this is different. I REPEAT, THIS   IS DIFFERENT. We have finally found a way to bleed those responsible   right in their jugular, but this is only the beginning. If we're to make   an actual difference then we can't stop with GME. We have to make sure   somehow that when the dust clears and Melvin and Shitron are 6 feet   under that we hold these types of organizations accountable from now on.  The world is watching us and we're for the first time in a position to lead by example, so please,   for the fucking love of god  ,   DON'T LET THIS BE THE END. For your fellow retards and autists, even  if  you don't have the money to go in, please, I beg of you, never stop   fighting the good fight. Never stop telling whoever is willing to  listen  how hard Wall Street has fucked us and how, in this moment, we  finally  found a way to fight back.  I think I realize now that people weren't complacent... they were   hopeless.     It's incredibly difficult to fathom where to even begin fighting back   when you're at risk of going hungry or not having a roof over your  head,  on top of the knowledge that whoever you're fighting could  bankrupt you  and not even think twice about it. However, I REPEAT, this  time it's  different. This time, we're an   informed collective  . We're literally in the spotlight and the entire country is our audience.  It's time to give hope back to the millions of people that had Wall Street steal it from them.  It's   OUR   time to shine.  TLDR;  Wall   Street's fucked us for too long, let's show them how long our schlongs   are. DeepFuckingValue is my God. 10 shares at $97 and   I'M NOT FUCKIN SELLING  .      DIAMOND   MY FRIENDS
File a complaint to SEC, but also LEAVE A REVIEW OF ROBINHOOD
Now I‚Äôm not saying leave a negative review of course, just state your honest opinions and give it a fair rating on the App Store. I‚Äôm sure Robinhood would appreciate that.
Just Threw in to GME $150. HOLD THE LINE!
Genuine question from a new autist looking to bolster the line with more GME shares
1611880075
Only used Robinhood til today, and now I can't open accounts through other brokers. I may not be able to buy more, but I can sure as hell keep holding
Last week I started a deposit to Robinhood so I could buy more GME, but it didn't go through until today. And of course now I can't actually use any of that. I tried opening accounts though Webull, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab, but I couldn't finish opening them for various reasons, most of which stem from my phone service getting cut off earlier this month (can't do text/call verification).    This will not break my hold on my measly 14 shares. I woke up this morning and saw 5 digits for the first time in my life. People's lives are changing, we can do this together.  ü§ùüí™
BB READY TO TAKEOFF    STRAP IN

Dying Dreams-didn't get in on this but damn yall make these mofos cry... Lose another night of sleep
HOLD IT WILL        ONCE ROBINHOOD FALLS
If you're worried about bitching out - turn your notifications off and check back tomorrow.
It looks scary but it's not. Hold you clowns.
Stay strong - paper handed p ssies may have weakened us, but we were happy with a Thursday close above $115 earlier this week.
[Discussion] IF YOUR NOT IN AMERICA, BUY GME! THEY‚ÄôRE LIMITING THE US FROM BUYING BUT NOT INTERNATIONAL, THIS AINT ABOUT MONEY ANYMORE, THIS IS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE
Robin Hood and other brokerages are preventing us from buying GME AMC NOK which is market manipulation! They don‚Äôt want the ordinary to become wealthy, they only care about keeping the big hedges booming! So stand with me when I say BUY AND HOLD       WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER ü§ù
STAY STONG BROTHERS!!!!! I AM DOWN $20K BUT I AM HOLDING!!!!!!

Robinhood completely removed GME from their app.
GME WILL GO BACK UP, WAY WAY UP. HOLD AND BUY THIS DIP HARD
This is how we all profit tomorrow and beyond.
Everything's on sale! BUY BUY BUY GME AMC BB NOK!!!!
I'm a retarded ape who likes bananas and it's all going for so cheap right now.      I just like the stock.
Reddit is trying to stop me!
I don't know if its just me but reddit keeps closing everytime I load this subreddit. It says I'm not allowed to view this subreddit. Error. Wtf is happening
Volume is too low for them to cover. The drops are insignificant part of the volume. The price have to go up for them to cover. HOOOOLLDDD
Public won‚Äôt let buys on the dip
Tried to get in a little more on this dip and they stopped the buys only selling...
Webull seems to be working.
Hey just wanted to let everyone know that my webull trading app is still allowing me to buy those stocks when they're not suspended. They are suspending a lot for AMC gme nok and other, me and some friend have positions in all them right now and holding the line! No matter what!
Nok
Nok is low! Buy the Nok!   This is not financial advice but retarded
A future war on IPO
If Robinhood ever goes for an IPO, swear to Lord Almighty, we'll short that fucktards to the ground.
If RobinHood is down.. use eToro or another market to buy, simple.. just don't bitch out and sell, were in this together
Stonks are coming for those who are patient.
Stash app is still allowing buys on Gme, AMC, etc...
The system is lagging, but they‚Äôre not Robinhood so that‚Äôs a plus
Your gonna have to pry it from my cold dead    G M E
Forget Robinhood, eTrade just let me buy AMC and GME!
eTrade is working right now. I just got a share of GME for only $120! Get on the rocket guys!!!
How does sales to a short seller work?
Like if there were hypothetically a short ratio of stock at 95%, could 5% of short sellers buy the stock and then resell their 5% to the other short sellers. I guess I misunderstand. If 140% of the stock is shorted, couldn't one individual just hold his one stock and sell it at infinity price. It sounds like a small amount of stock is just recycled through the entire stock of shorts.
TD AMERITRADE refuses to let me sell options
The order is not an opening transaction. It will decrease or close an existing options position.; Underlying is a hard to borrow stock. We are not accepting this order type at this time.  Put in a limit at 3x my money‚Ä¶ they won't even let me sell it.

SEC Complaints against everyone!
I think we can all agree that removing the ability to buy stocks, except MM and funds, is blatant market manipulation.   Should we all be filing multiple complaints to the SEC about this?   Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Melvin, Citiadel, EVERYONE!
What RH/Brokers and all these scumbag hedge funds are doing right now will be met with fire and fury. These are the most evil of people.
Absolutely ridiculous and we will absolutely sue them.   That being said...   HOLD! These diamond hands gonna get me to jump out the mothafuckin Porsche!
ITS ONLY FALLING BECAUSE PPL CANT BUY DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS UNLESS YOU ARE NEGATIVE IQ ONCE TRADING RESUMES WE GOING TO THE MOON
Disallow buy orders only allow sell orders, the price dips. End result, calls expire OTM. And they are off the hook tomorrow.
It's all being done for the calls tomorrow. Robinhood doesn't pay a dime if calls expire OTM. It's never about the shares we hold. It's the calls we hold.
TastyWorks restricts trading on AMC, GME and KOSS
What app can I use to buy in Canada?
I was already poor
So I bought what I could into GME and if I lose it, well I'm still in the same boat. HOLD TIGHT DO NOT SELL and we WIN
Can we make a spreadsheet to how brokerages handled $GME?
Looking to cash out of robinhood after all this is over but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who would like to see who participated in blocking buys on GameStop. I think only E-trade from what I can tell?
You   üèª are going to regret folding tomorrow
6 DAYS TO COVER!!!!

HOLD MY RETARDED HODOR BROTHERS, IF YOU DO HOLD, THE SKY IS THE FUCKING, HOOOOOOOOLDDDD THE DOOOOOOOOOOR. THEN GTFO OF ROBINHOOD AND BRING YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE, SO FUCKS LOST A LOT OF CUSTOMERS TODAY!!!!
SEC COMPLAINT: Sold other stock holdings and deposited further money to invest into GME, AMC, and NOK. Was then wrongly not authorized to make these purchases on Robinhood, eliminating my means of freely investing and advantaging the time-value of money.
SEC COMPLAINT: Sold other stock holdings and deposited further money to invest into GME, AMC, and NOK.   Was then wrongly not authorized to make these purchases on Robinhood, eliminating my means of freely investing and advantaging the time-value of money. Simply refunding this money will not be a suitable compromise, as it barred me from investing opportunities, which would have resulted in market gains of XX%, which were also manipulated by Robinhood/others banning of only certain stocks and leaving the option to sell. Gains missed by this opportunity were 200%+ from low point to high point of opening, with market manipulation also limiting that.
I‚Äôm looking at GME likes it‚Äôs on sale
If price stays around where it is now, I‚Äôm dumping my paycheck tomorrow on more GME! Holding what I currently have. To the moon!!
Where can UK Idiots buy THE DIP???
GameStop won‚Äôt Stop!   ARE FOREVER!!!

I'm Interested in Telling This story
Let's be honest, mainstream media has zero interest in representing you properly. They have zero interest in representing the issue and it's mechanics accurately.   So far they have demonised this sub and retail traders and labelled you all amateurs getting in the way of "real traders"  They don't want your story told. But I do.   I'm a youtuber, not a huge one but that won't matter if enough people watch the video. It'll get picked up by the algorithm and promoted.   Would anyone be willing to give me an accurate timeline of how this all happened and why. The why is important. Also give me an easy way to relay the more complicated terminology to a more colloquial audience.   I won't shaft this group or anyone who decides to help and if you decide not too that's fine too. I'll still make the video it'll just take me longer to research.   I like underdog stories, everyone does and if it's told right you can have more of a public backing.   Comment if interested and please link sources where possible   Thanks   Lee  Peaked Interest on YouTube
I can still buy in the UK
Should I buy the dip? GME going cheap right now!
I sure as hell fucking hope that karma is real.
We need to focus on one stock to squeeze
We need to be coordinated, stop making chaos and wait for calls!
CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN AND LET THEM KNOW THIS CRAP CANT BE TOLERATED. FREE MARKET MEANS FREE MARKET!!!!
No more picking on the little man.
Just dropped all my investing money into $SLV
I have no idea what I'm doing but a couple of people on here said it was a good move so I did it.  Wish me luck boys.    Let's get this bread.
4k TO NOK LETS GO!!!
What the fuck is going on!
$gme is currently sitting at 126$ and $AMC is sitting at   $. these fuckers are manipulating the market because they think we are going to give up? fuck them i am doubling down.
Please! DONT FUCKING SELL!!
This is a War!  Hold GME and AMC!!!  WE MUST WIN!!!  When they fucking crack the economy is ‚Äúthe market‚Äù, when we win they stop is abuse.  FUCK OFF. FUCKING HOLD!
Will hedges pull their longs? Buy the dipppp
If hedge funds have to sell longs to cover their positions, there will likely be a red day, in which case, we buy the dip out of everything. The markets will be tilted towards retail.
I've never really figured out how stocks work, but my god I'm proud of you lot today.
How in the fuck have you made  GameStop  a major player overnight? I've been sat here amazed for the past hour but no-one I know's gonna care.   As a side note, is this the same reason that Elon musk is now the richest person in the world? Cause if so, that's one hell of a way to prove a point.  I love Reddit.
Brokers Can‚Äôt Ban Physical Silver
You all just learned a hard lesson about how the establishment protects itself by watching the brokers restrict the ability to squeeze the short hedge funds. Squeezing the bullion banks who are short silver by buying the physical metal does not require going through brokers....  Just saying....
GME today
I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but..
Don‚Äôt be rid of robinhood just yet. A lot of people are selling what they have with robinhood and dropping them. THATS NOT HODLING.   Even if it means keeping that garbage app, fucking hold
Focus on the man BEHIND THE SCREE - Citadel
Hey guys, focus your anger on the company behind Robinhood, CITADEL.  They are the ones that blocked buying. They are the ones that are doing this, to save their BILLIONAIREs.   Make sure you mention Citadel and Robinhood together. Any sort of legal or regulatory action has to get BOTH of them.
I've been constantly watching $GME and 2 times today the buy price jumped to 1000s last time it was 9999
Uhhh what happened to GME? I know Robinhood and the hedge funds are manipulating the market, but is this an error?
LOOKY LOOKY WE ARE IN THE FINAL DIP
Robinhood will be issuing their own IPO in the very near future.
How do you think the current state of affairs will effect the Robinhood IPO? I don't think this is favorable for them but I am not sure how they can lose on an IPO.
Next Step - Boycott Robinhood
Let's be clear - Robinhood's actions today (and others) manipulated the market and destroyed any semblance of neutrality they might have had. A class action suit takes time, and we need an immediate act.  Wsb has a megaphone right now and I suggest we use it by starting a boycott of Robinhood. Why should we keep our money in a platform that actively fights against us on behalf of the rich and Wall Street?
RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY
You dumb fucks, buy the dip. This isn't even close to over. It is just getting started. Buy the dip and hold to the bitter fucking end.
Fidelity Still allowing buy orders!
Yo can we burn Robinhood to the ground for pulling this shit?
GME Megathread
Keep it all here. Please.  We love you guys too. Be kind to each other.
Freetrade (UK) - buy order rejected
Twice now, anyone else??
Stop transferring to other apps until you know it‚Äôs available there
Webull is saying that GME is suspended. WAIT TO SELL!
DONT SELL. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE BIG SHORTERS WANT ü§≤ ü§≤
This should be the wave that starts Occupy Wall Street
I'll keep it short.      What has happened today has been a blatant denial of our rights to a free market - you all have heard that countless times before. This is being done to keep us poor, to keep us at the lower rungs.     There's   people on this sub and millions of others who are against what has been happening. Hell, even my own mom is happy seeing these hedgers getting fucked over. That means that now is not the time to stand down.      All these brokerages have done by restricting our ability to buy and sell stocks because we like the stock has only magnified the already large spotlight.   Continue to exercise your rights. The more stocks that are restricted, the more publicity this control gets.     btw, when ja rule is talking about you know it's some real shit           To those OG members who were here years ago, we've made history, tendies or not.
REMEMBER, WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. ITS RETIREMENT ON A YACHT OR FOODSTAMPS.
Hold GME, nobody is selling so the bid/ask spread is getting skewed low by the low ballers  This is not financial advice, I just really like video games.
Can any of the executives at GME/NOK/BB/AMC file lawsuits for what happened today?
I would imagine they are just as pissed as us.
WEBULL SUSPENDED AS WELL- HOLD HOLD HOLD!
Just got this notification from RH. So much for ‚Äúdemocratizing finance for all‚Äù.
BOOMERS CAN SUCK MY WIGGLY DICK, DONT FUCKING SELL YOU PUSSYS

What are your thoughts?
What do we do now
$AMC, $GME and $BB are unpurchasable so where do we got from here boys
Robinhood employees should go on strike
How can you work at a company that steals from the poor to give to the rich.      Go on strike. Rally outside the office. Yell your concerns. This is bullshit.      25c-BB-3/16
I put in a stop loss at 120 a share, forgot it was there and lost most of my money :[
And I cant buy back in.  Im on robinhood and I dont have funds elsewhere.  I dont get paid til next week. What the FUCK
THIS. IS. NOT. US. WSB IS NOT SELLING.
BIG CORPS ARE SELLING THEIR POSITIONS AND STOPPING OUR   BROTHERS FROM BUYING.   THIS. IS. A. SCARE. TACTIC.   Wait for Friday and Beyond. I still like this stock.     ‚úä
Are people actually selling?
Stocks like AMC, NOK, and GME. They are all tanking. Will this bounce back Friday or is this hype over with? I‚Äôm holding my amc
Hi I don't know anything but I bought BB
Is this Intelligent Investing? I bought the book but I didn't read it.
LOOK HERE - Price Displayed at 150, sold a little, as my friends have told me they got more than it said the stock was worth. The price i sold .15 of a share at was at around 600 a share
Class Action Lawsuit Against Interactive Brokers
Preventing the buying of several stocks in collusion with Robinhood is market manipulation. The prevention of buy orders creates an imbalance between buyer and sellers and causes the stock price to decrease.
STOP SELLING YOU LITTLE SHITS! THATS WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO FUCKING DO!
Did y‚Äôall just forget what this community has been on about since the last one month? Did a greyed out button make you shit your pants! Grow a fucking pair and hold the fucking line!
(PSA) You might still be able to exercise your calls! I was able to exercise my SNDL this morning when it was at   market cap.
Sorry for lack of photo, WSB doesn‚Äôt like Imgur and Apollo uploads there for posts. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   To the moon motherfuckers
Hold!
So I guess forcing a panic sell by manipulating the market and trashing your citizen investors is a normal strategy to protect your bankers?
Webull issue?
Anyone else having issues with Webull right now? I can‚Äôt see any price quotes on amc, nakd or anything else right now and the comment sections seem blocked.
BUY THE GME DIP!!!
It's only a matter of time until it skyrockets again you!!! The short ladder attacks cannot last that long!
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD!
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD THE FORT BOYS!
Webull is part of the gang
Down over 50% because Webull wouldn‚Äôt show my positions for me to be able to sell. Comments are down, suspensions every few minutes. down with Webull!
How in the hell do these mofuxckers blocked "buy" and keep sell are they stupid?
Boomers are basically underestimating the power of internet. This will only accelerate our tempt to buy and not sell. We are seeing some dip due to the block and as soon as the buy shows up it will hit the moon. So folks KEEEEEEEEP. Selling now is basiccaly saying you just lost the war towards hedge fund scumbagg
I didnt buy GME to sell at a loss
I like this stock and wont fucking sell at a loss
Thought you guys had balls.
Buy AMC you pussies
Its not just GME, its BB, AMC, NOK and more. Dont let them win, buy and fucking hold. FLY ME TO THE MOON

This is not the end! We are going to win!!
Diamond hands

YOU CAN STILL BUY AMC ON CASHAPP
CASHAPP still allows AMC trading on their app, and deposits can be instant when you link your bank account. GME is not on CASHAPP however.
Merrill Lynch joins in blocking GME, AMC
Where can we trade right now? I can wire it anywhere.
I have not sold.  Let everyone know where you're trading from if you still can.  TLDR; DONT READ. ITS ANTI SHORT POST EXTRA CHARACTERS AUTO BOT BULLSHIT  Gd I can't believe I'm typing extra shit here just to avoid an auto ban. My last short post, not metaphorical, left me auto banned and without thinking I replied to someone from my phone on my newer first name account and was banned from all of reddit for three days during all of this.
SoFi Money lets you buy GME I think
Just got 4 more.  Surprised it even went through tbh.
NADK and SNDL

SXTC - $1
SXTC to dollarland by this afternoon.
Holding my 2 shares from Lebanon! Hold you retarded incels!!
Hold the line boiisss, we can‚Äôt buy but we ain‚Äôt sellin!!
Let's get AMC to an all time high when we can buy the stock again! This is so wrong on so many levels and we cannot let the hedge funds win.
What‚Äôs the next big move?
If this community was able to overnight GME, AMCE, BB, NOK, SNDL, what‚Äôs stopping us from moving on to another $10 stock and doing the same exact thing? They can stop them all they want after a day or so of inflation but we‚Äôve already gained our profits not to mention proving on a wider scale the lengths Wall Street is willing to go to stop the average Joe trader.
AMC sand nok got real low, I just bought more!!!
Buy and hold guys!!!

LOOK AT THE FUCKING GRAPH OF THE VOLKSWAGEN SQUEEZE. WE ARE APPROACHING THE FINAL BOSS, AS LONG AS WE HOLD WE WILL GET OUR TENDIES. HEDGE FUNDS ARE DOING CO-ORDINATED ATTACKS TO SCARE US OUT. DO NOT FUCKING SELL RETARDS, BUY FUCKING MORE! WE WILL WIN!
It's Beautiful

AMC Stock still Tradable on Cash App
Im not sure if i‚Äôm being dumb or not but, i JUST bought stocks in AMC from cash app so go there if you wish to invest in AMC still!
What does it mean when trading triggers a halt?
I was able to get in this morning but stock has dropped and triggered a halt. I'm guessing its done for the day but can they still trade after hours?
Retweet let's get them onboard. $GME
CHANGE BROKERS! GET OFF ROBINHOOD!
Every  single Robinhood user needs to get the fuck off Robinhood.  Switch to a  TD, Schwab, Webull, Tradestation, MooMoo, or whatever, but Robinhood is  no longer going to have WSB users on their platform.  The degenerate gamblers on this platform are the lifeblood of Robinhood.  Fuck them.
GME is tanking should I sell??!
ROBINHOOD'S STATEMENT ON CURRENTLY RESTRICTED STOCKS
CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM THAT THESE STOCKS DONT SHOW UP ON THE SEARCH AND AREN'T AVAILABLE FOR BUY ORDERS? I DONT USE THIS POS PLATFORM
$GME Isn‚Äôt falling because there is no interest, it‚Äôs because a massive amount of investors can‚Äôt buy right now. Don‚Äôt just hold, BUY. Buy however you can!
The price is way down, but the the trading volume doesn‚Äôt correlate. Market‚Äôs been open for 2 hours, there‚Äôs   more hours to go, but the volume‚Äôs only 25 million. The short float is still sitting at 122%, so there‚Äôs a hell of a lot more to squeeze out. Now is the time to buy, more than ever!
I left for 90 minutes could someone explain to me what the actual fuck just happened, why is GME at 120?
These People are fucking Crooks and Need to be in Jail
This fucking obvious market manipulation, blindingly obvious. These people should be in Jail or lined up against a wall. The system is a joke. If they keep doing stuff like this how long till someone snaps? I won't cry for them either.
These people can‚Äôt be serious.
Opened a Charles Schwab acct to support GME.
CS still let's you buy but won't have funds til tmw, hold the line boys and girls!!!
So no more $BB üëÄ
It's over isn't it?
They're going to cover their shares at whatever price they want today, they lost some money, but nowhere near as much as they were fearing, and we lose.  That's what happened here isn't it?  I can't see any reason to hold at this point.
Can someone please explain the drop in GME to me?
I don‚Äôt understand if we‚Äôre all just selling out or is this further manipulation from the RH app. Plus Fidelity is preventing me from trading on their site as well.
Stop talking about a class action right now. That is not what is needed right now. Some sort of court order is needed immediately! Who has contacts?
THE SQUAD HAS OUR BACK
You can buy GME on Tastyworks
Fuck me I missed the dip cause apps take TOO LONG TO APPROVE ACCOUNTS
Edit: Fuck robinhood.
Test flight went well, now time for everyone to board, prepare for takeoff
HOLDDDDD
Holding AMC strong. Can‚Äôt bet on GME anywhere. SEC shutting down the internet
So
How much money have ya‚Äôll lost in the last hour?
PSA: You can still buy GME on Vanguard! Buy the dip and    Ô∏è
Vanguard allows you to buy stocks, not just ETFs, though the interface is a bit clunkier than other places.  But fellow Americans, if you have a vanguard account you can buy!!  Good luck!! Buy the dip and don't fall for the market manipulation!    Ô∏è And to the moon!
Remember this day as one where we truly realized that the system is rigged.
Every possible illegal way to railroad the retail investor has been used in the last weeks, culminating in "Well if you won't play by our rules, you cannot participate."  If you can only sell your positions, the Supply Demand balance instantly drops the stock to next to nothing.  Wall Street has quantifiably shown you that they can take infinite risk with no repercussions, and there is nothing we can do about it.  If the SEC or our government does not address this and make people whole, you now know that all of the talk of "looking out for the little guy" is demonstrably false.
Sometimes support comes from the most unexpected places

THE SQUEEZE STILL HASNT HAPPENED REMEMBER THEYRE AT 140% SI
HOLD THE LINE    PUBLIC HAS GME AND INSTANT DEPOSITS GET IT WHILE IT'S ON SALE  Not financial advice
I panic sold my GME at 140 and robinhood wouldn't let me cancel
Other brokers worth using over RH?
Fuck them. I'll continue my small part in this fight somewhere else.
I‚Äôm holding... How bout you?? After this it‚Äôs bye bye RH Bitch ass MF‚Äôs
Rick isn't shady, neither are we. This is all getting more corrupt by the minute. Don't give in! Wubalubadubdub!!!
DON'T SELL! This proves that the rich and big corps are afraid of the people! Do no falter! Hold! Hold! Hold!
Keeping holding everyone! We will prevail!
FUCK ROBINHOOD, FUCK THE HEDGE FUNDS, AND FUCK ANYONE WHO DOUBTS WSB. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. WE WILL RETURN TO THE MOON.
SoFi investing is a good option.
No issues with trade halting on their systems. Just server slow down but it's getting better.  Don't know if the flare is right.
Hi! Do I understand it correctly that GME stock will go back in price soon?
I checked a few hours ago and it was 400$. Now it‚Äôs 153$. I think it‚Äôs because robinhood made it so you can‚Äôt buy it anymore and that stupid company that I forgot name of is selling it to themselves over and over again. So does that mean when robinhood will (and it probably will) get hit with a lawsuit the price will go back to infinity and beyond?
Here‚Äôs what to fill for Complaint to SEC
Robinhood's namesake has been eviscerated today.
This criminal market manipulation is literally encouraging the little guy to sell to benefit the rich. This is the antithesis of the name. This company has lost any chance of me trading with them ever again, they'll likely lose millions on this but hey, who cares when they make countless more with their daddy hedge funds?   Once this wave of horseshit is over, I'm out. I recommend Uninstalling and investing using other programs.
The whale we haven‚Äôt heard from yet
Remember, we haven‚Äôt heard from Ryan Cohen yet.  Have faith in Papa Cohen. He won‚Äôt let us down.  GME

So we‚Äôre not allowed to buy but everyone is selling? HOLD THE LINE FROM THESE CORRUPT MOTHERFUCKERS

IF I CAN HOLD YOU CAN TOO
$  @ $440 - I AINT FUCKIN LEAVIN! HOLD!
What is going on with the stocks right now in terms of value and why is everyone saying to hold? Are we expected to come back from this?
About To fly on a plane for 4hrs I can‚Äôt sell! I‚Äôm gonna hold no matter what!!!! Hold the line!!
Today is worse than the financial crisis. This is the biggest fraud I have ever seen.
Thoughts?
Just bought more GME at a slick discount through Schwab. KEEP HOLDING. I think there's less selling than we think. A lot of this is market manipulation. They are DESPERATE. I'M STAYING ON BOARD
I have lost $400 so far on GME and   I'm still holding
I know some of you are hurting out   know some of you are left standing while others retreated with what they   know that if you think you are   are not. I am here with you holding this line, and like any great battle, we do not know if we will be victorious or if we will be   if we are defeated, let us be defeated with pride, and if we win, let us win with the knowledge that we held the line when things seemed impossible.   We will continue to be   big banks might already have recouped some of their   this is not a final   is just one more stage of this battle between main street and wall street.   For those of you still willing to fight on, despite the whole world being against us, then only invest what you are willing to invest (this is not financial advice) and we will see this battle together, as brothers, united by a common purpose.   We came together as shitposting strangers, but no matter what happens in the coming days, we will leave this subreddit as brothers, bound by blood. Stay strong and remember, sometimes you have to fall before you learn to fly.

Broke bitch wanting to help less broke bitch smack some rich people nuts
I've only ever been able to use robinhood and nothing else, too poor. But fuck wallstreet and rich, i wanna help y'all break their system. How
How and where can I buy GME stocks from Germany and what should I consider while doing so?
I never traded and don't know how it really works.  I heard of Robinhood for the US (though, it's no longer available, I guess) but I'm from Germany. I want to contribute to the cause.   Can someone give me information on how to do so, please?
HOLD STRONG SOILDERS THE TIDE OF THE WAR WILL TURN
DONT GIVE IN NOW, THE NIGHT IS DARKEST BEFORE THE DAWN.
YOU SELL, THEY WIN. IT REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE
MAKE HISTORY
its down to 126. i bought for 368. RIP
No media uproar
Legal ? So Wall Street is removing the ability to retail traders to buy high flying stocks on which big institutions are short the day before 01/29 call option expire? And their narrative is they are doing that to PROTECT US, but how is making US lose a lot of money while their position gains value and momentum helping anyone other than large institutions? The story of Robin Hood is taking from the rich to give it to the poor, the people at Robinhood are openly doing the opposite and no one seems to be doing anything about it. The first step in fixing the wealth gap is giving the masses a chance and a voice
DONT SELL FUCKING HOLD!
WE ARE CAUSING A FUCKING PANIC ON WALL STREET, TODAY IS THEIR FIRST RETALIATION. WE KEEP FUCKING GOING DON'T LET UP ON THEM     KEEP FUCKING GOING!!!!
What can men do against such reckless hate?
Ride out with me.
You don't lose money until you sell.
You can't buy on RH? Fine. Switch to another broker to buy.   You can sell on RH? Fuck that.   If you've bought at 300+, you're making a huge fucking loss. If you bought at 100-, you could be making WAY more.   Just ask yourselves, what would DFV do?  We buy, We hold, We win.
Wallstreet I got one thing to say to you
You think my poverty is your ally? I was born in it, molded by it. I didn‚Äôt see money until I was already a man. And by then it was nothing me but a burden.   Bring it the fuck on I‚Äôll let this bitch go to zero   HOLD THE FUCKING LINE
Reminder: If you think its worth it, contact your congress-person regarding Citadel and various brokerage on securities fraud.
Obviously some of our shit-stain reps are A-OKAY with this garbage because they get their kingmaker kickbacks, but some are principled.    Contact your reps -- We all know this is bigger than a single hedge fund.  This is exactly where all the misguided anger came from that got Trump elected (economically destroyed rust-belt), or why progressives like Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, John Fetterman are widely liked.  Everyone knows what is rotting the United States at its core and SEC does nothing to punish those responsible.  America wants blood and enough of us don't even have 401ks to even care if it all burns to the ground.  This has to stop; we want free-and-fair markets.
CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT INQUIRY. WE NEED TO SUE THE SEC, ROBINHOOD, MELVIN AND FUCKING EVERYONE INVOLVED.
They manipulated not only the market but cut off our access to buy freely traded stocks. They tanked GME from this practice. It's illegal and we need representation to sue as a WHOLE.
Interactive brokers has now restricted BLACKBERRY BB
KEEP BUYING ON OTHER PLATFORMS
u/DeepFuckingValue should open a brokerage that is not going cheat to win.
ladies and Gents: This is a blatant coordinated attack by multiple trading platforms, CNBC Hosts, SEC, NASDAQ President, and Wall Street Hedge Funds against Retail Investors happen to anyone of them
They literally held us at bay buy preventing us from buying while they let Hedge Funds short the stock. Everytime the stock comes up, they will halt it to stop the momentum. They are preventing AMC from reaching above $10 since the Jan 29 $9 calls expire tomorrow.   They know nothing will happen to them because Congress will just look the other way and continue to argue about Impeachment trials and "But but BIDEN Executive orders" and continue their vendetta against each other for their internal political fight.
FUCK THESE WALL STREET COCKROACHES MANIPULATING THE MARKET VIA BROKERS
I LIKE THE STOCK I LIKE THE STOCKS
Legal action?
Anybody know of any legal actions any of us can take?
DONT GIVE IN TO THE FEAR! STAY STRONG

MOVE TO ANOTHER BROKER
Just because robinhood banned the buying of GME doesn't mean you have to sell it. Hold it and even move to another broker like e trade to buy more while its low. Hold on y'all, we can do this!

Questions
With robinhood and TD playing games are there other/ better options?
We The People...
I've been a long-time lurker on a lot of subs. I usually don't engage, usually just scroll and enjoy, but what r/wallstreetbets is doing is legendary. This isn't about political party, isn't about race, isn't about gender, isn't about religion, it's about WE THE PEOPLE vs. the fat cats that have been screwing over the little guy for years, making billions off our pain and suffering.  I'm not going to pretend I understand every term used on this sub, or am even a quarter as smart as some of you, but I've never been prouder to do my part, hold $GME and $BB and watch the people RISE UP.   If no one reads this, that's ok, but I wanted to document my stance on the right side of history. One day, when I have kids, and they start asking me about financial advice, this is the first story I'll tell them.   You fuckers make me so damn proud.
Going in hard on SNDL ..... WHO$ WITH?!?
Don't sell GME, from a Canadian
Fellow retards, I'm a Canadian retard who bought into GME at $400 with over $5000 worth in shares. I know it looks bad right now but if we don't hold then we all lose. Profit is to be had here, justice will be called onto those who are illegally manipulating the markets.  HOLD THE LINE, THEY CAN'T STOP ALL OF US. AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY ANYMORE, IT'S ABOUT MAKING A POINT.  We can win retards.
Fellow    RETARD APES
IM MOT FUCKING LEAVING!!!! Hold the door!! It‚Äôs coming back. I can‚Äôt wait.
Everyone don‚Äôt start scolding each other here. We need to stick together.
Everyone trying to buy today.
Opening a margin account with at least $2k in etrade or webull will give you access to the funds immediately. They both allow trade of amc, gme,    webull will allow you to trade immediately after opening the account.   Not financial advice.  Do what you want.   Position 2 gme 115c 2/19 and 20 shares 18 amc calls various strikes
GME chart right now. Don‚Äôt let your broker fool you
Best brokerage in Canada for quick setup and buy?
Trying to get in on this GME but I don't have an account setup with a brokerage yet. I've set up one with TD but its been a day and they haven't gotten back to me yet so I'm wondering if there are any that are a quick setup and buy or if I'm just screwed for now.
THIS IS NOT A SELLOFF THIS IS A SALE
ROBINHOOD IS FUCKING PEOPLE OVER BY DOWNING GME, AMC, AND NOK BUT THAT ONLY MEANS THAT THE REST OF US CAN BUY THAT SHIT UP ON A 50% SALE GET THE FUCK IN THIS SHIT IS GONNA MOON TOMORROW      AMC ‚Äî> $60 EOW
YOU CAN BUY GME STOCK ON SOFI
It‚Äôs crashing, is the ride over or is this just turbulence? I‚Äôm only doing $100 as a broke college student but I don‚Äôt wanna lose ya know.
I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING  ü§ö
GUYS BUY FROM ANOTHER APP, AND HOLD, REMEMBER THEY NEED TO COVER THEIR SHOTS, THAT'S WHY WE WANT A BIG PRICE. HOLD HOLD HOLD. COME ON.
IT'S GONNA SKYROCKET! HALT AFTER HALT! Hold the line boys!!!!!! The ladder attacks can only last so long
HOLD THE LINE! IT WILL GO UP!
OK, so which one of us autists is gonna make a RobinHood replacement?
Obviously, as extremely serious traders engaged in getting some extremely serious tendies, we need reliable tools to do the job. So I guess we gotta build that shit, the market is clearly there.  I can write the software if someone can sort out the legal BS. And obviously for profit. We need something that honest autist can use to make tendies and crash a market or two.
buckle up and hold on, all they have done is stopped us at the gates but we ain‚Äôt leaving
It is time to take to the streets
Like so many, I'm a first-time poster here.  I only have this to say.  It is clear that the stock market and our system checks and balances are set up to only benefit the rich and not the middle/lower classes.     They see us as nothing more than people they can take from to fund their mansions and yachts. So many people have lost combined millions of dollars this morning.      It is time to take our collective outrage to them.  If the "Free Market" is no longer free and open to all there is no reason to have it.  And if we can't trade on Wall Street we should stand on that street in person and demand to know why.  It is time to Occupy Wall Street again.     I'm sure this will get deleted but I'm pissed.
This is mostly likely Melvin Capital selling all their stock that they bought and now its is causing other people to sell. Don't fall for it, the squeeze is yet to come.
This is not financial advice, I dropped out in 2nd grade I don't know what I'm saying its a work of fiction.
HOLD THE LINE THESE CORRUPTED FUCKS WON'T WIN! WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THEIR TRADES REMEMBER WE ARENT ALLOWED TO TRADE, HOLD THE LINE WE WILL WIN!
LETS GET IT!
Anyone notice they keep suspending GME anytime the price goes UP? They want you to sell, they don't suspend trading if selling is happening. HOLD THE LINE
We like the stock.
Ameritrade just let me purchase stock in both AMC and NOK
If you have, hold. If you don't, buy.
The hate i have for the Wall Street Casino, is greater than the suspicion i have that any of you are selling. HOLDING TILL ZERO.
Who has control of the halting of the sale of these companies?
And who is working with these apps to block purchasing by the everyday man?
(Get this to the top) You can still buy GME on Fidelity, E-Trade, and Schwab. If there are others, post them here.
WEBULL AND TASTYWORKS ARE NOT RESTRICTING TRADES

Shinzo wo Sasageyo!
I‚Äòm announcing our final opperation! All Troops, line up! We will be doing a cavalry charge. Our goal: To rush the Beast Titan. Of course, we‚Äòll be making ourselves ideal targets. So we‚Äòll be wait until he‚Äòs ready to throw and fire our smoke signals together. That should reduce his accuracy somewhat. While we‚Äòre acting as a decoy Captain Levi will kill the Beast Titan. That is our plan. Standing and waiting just means we‚Äòll be showered by more boulders. Get ready on the double! Cadet: Are we all‚Ä¶ heading‚Ä¶ to our deaths? Yes. Cadet: If we‚Äòre gonna die anyways, you‚Äòre saying it‚Äòs better‚Ä¶ if we die fighting? Yes. Wait‚Ä¶ if we‚Äòre gonna die anyways, no matter how we die, even if it‚Äòs disobeying orders, it all means nothing, right? You‚Äòre precisely right. It‚Äòs all meaningless. No matter what dreams or hopes you had‚Ä¶ No matter how blessed a life you‚Äòve lived‚Ä¶ It‚Äòs all the same if you‚Äòre shattered by rocks. Everyone will day someday. Does that mean life is meaningless? Was there even any meaning in our being born? Would you say that to our fallen comrades? Their lifes‚Ä¶ Were they meaningless? No they weren‚Äòt! It‚Äòs us who gives meaning to our comrade‚Äòs lives! The brave fallen! The anguished fallen! The ones who will remember them‚Ä¶ are us, the living! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world! My soldiers, rage! My soldiers, scream! My soldiers, fight!

Not calling for any violence or brigading or protests. Just saying that this is what I plan on doing as a lone individual.
Who is behind the BUY blocks?
I am/was a Robinhood user and like everyone else, havent been able to buy a range of stocks this morning. I know other apps have also blocked buys and they say this is due to market volatility.   Genuine question - can the SEC tell brokers to block buys or can they only call halts? Are hedge funds able to buy at this time? My guess is yes.
Y'all think any chance Elon is gonna help us?
What if we get #helpelon trending? Should be buy?
HOLD GME!!!

Or in this case review words speak louder than Reddit words. I understand we can‚Äôt close out robinhood accounts because we‚Äôre holding gme to the moon, but why aren‚Äôt we giving them a negative review everywhere we can?
Lawmakers are already taken notice of this market manipulation by the brokerages to protect the hedge funds and screw retail buyers

VOLUME IS ZERO. PRICE MEANS NOTHING. 1 GME = 1 GME = INFINITY US DOLLARS COME MONDAY
The only thing that is going to stop this is the actual DELISTING or open brazen criminal action that will surely bring about an actual rebellion.  I am a retard. I am 100% anti-violent and anti-war forever and under all circumstances. What is happening is the closest we've ever been to making the GOOD PEOPLE'S voice heard. WE ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE! We BELIEVE in truth and LOVE and PEACE and RETARDATION.  Volume is ZERO. This price is 100% FAKE. WE HAVE WON! HOLD FOREVER!!
Looking forward to our time-traveling lord DFV's post tonight!

This is blatant market manipulation. The volume today during this drop was a fraction of volume on previous trading days. People are not selling! We all knew this dip was coming (see VW squeeze).   Liftoff is imminent!
What is going to skyrocket next?
I was late to the gamestop, which feels lame due to me being a gamer! But what should I look into next?
I like GameStop
This whole situation is crazy, but I‚Äôm Thrilled it happened to GameStop.   GameStop is a company that has brought people joy since 1984! It‚Äôs been sad watching it decline over the years, fighting a drawn out losing battle against the digital world.   I heard that before Covid they were going to try and change to more of a modern LAN cafe model to try and keep things going, which sounded like a cool idea but then obviously Covid hit and that‚Äôs the end of that...  What I‚Äôm trying to say is I‚Äôm incredibly happy that GameStop is getting a huge second chance to make a comeback, and I‚Äôm very excited to see what they do in the future.   I‚Äôd love it if my future kids get the chance to stand in front of a wall of games to choose from.   HOLD for the future of gaming and the generations of gamers behind us.

It seems extremely poetic
KEEP HOLDING THIS IS THEIR HAIL MARRY
The shorts are selling to each other to drive down prices.  This was predicted and we are seeing it happen now.  I know this is scary but we can get through this if we keep holding.  I have lost a good amount of money but im still gonna hold because before we know it, we'll be on the moon.  If i hadnt already hit my max for spending I would have really liked to go in right now.  Good luck all, I'll see you on the other side of this.  Fidelity is up and there are no restictions on shares, do not sell on rh just move over to fidelity and keep your shares in rh until the big juice.

BB RALLYING GROUP. WE LIKE THIS STOCK
I know I know, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy anything but GME‚Äù is the notion that‚Äôs been going on. But BlackBerry is a great investment, and an even better one right now with the dip that‚Äôs affecting us all. BlackBerry no longer sells phones and are shifting their views to software and cyber security. They have a huge Amazon partnership and their partnership with Baidu is only gonna implement them in a better position in the near future. Outside of giving it to the shorter, BB looks primed to rise in the future. Selling right now is NOT THE MOVE. BUY THE DIP. This company is going to grow by the EOY and beyond! WE LIKE THIS STOCK. I‚Äôve lost almost 1,000 right now on BB but I‚Äôm gonna double down and buy 50 more shares on E-Trade (a comment said that you can buy BB on there, will confirm after I buy). BUY GME, BUY BB, WE LIKE THESE STOCKS. SELLING IS FOR LITTLE TODDLERS.

TD now charging $1500 a share for GME. How is that possible?
It's not just Robinhood can't buy GME on Webull

WHAT SHOULD I BUY?
I have 22$ rn.
I'm willing to lose my $10k. Fuck you Melvin, and fuck you Robinhood
I put in $10k in GME hoping to make some money out of this. Now I've lost over half of it. I was initially gonna pull out because I'd rather minimize the risk, and then I thought "There's people here with lesser money than me and they're still in to prove a point". I may not have directly affected by the 08 crash as some of the others here, but my immigrant ass is here to stand with you.     Fuck this shit. Fuck you Melvin, and fuck you Robinhood. When we're done and the dust settles, we'll dance over your graves. And even if you slaughter us all, we'll rise again. If you crater GME and the calls don't trigger on Friday, we'll find another stock. We'll buy physical gold and silver and squeeze your market manipulation there.     Blatant collusion and market manipulation while you cry foul to your billionaire mommies and daddies for the same fucking reason is stupid. Well guess what beats stupidity...retardation.     HOLD THE LINE FELLOW RETARDS.  .
They just blew their payload, and it looks like there's enough of us standing to finish this.
Hold.
Together HOLD!!
We fought together, against our common enemy. Despite our differences, despite our suspicions‚Äîtogether. And we need to do the same if we‚Äôre going to survive, because the enemy is real. It‚Äôs always been real.   The long night is coming, and the suits come with it. No clan can stop them, the free folk can‚Äôt stop them, the Night‚Äôs Watch can‚Äôt stop them and all the southern kings can‚Äôt stop them. Only together, all of us , and even then it might not be enough but at least we‚Äôll give the f ers a fight.

GME TO THE MOON, DONT SELL
Lets Talk about what we can do right now.
Alright my tendie loving winners, today is the darkest day of the story of GME. Watching my position fall 80% is not easy, but realizing the opportunity we have to fuck the hedge firms is keeping my peen rock solid.  What I'm talking about isnt about buying GME in the masses to take it to the moon, but HOLDING so that these fucks absolutely have to exert every crooked maneuver in their power to put this stock in the dirt.   Imagine we all hold here, and nobody in wsb sells. If this stock price goes back down and the only outstanding short volume is from citadel and melvin, the proof is in the pudding. These assholes will be caught red handed and there is no way that they can deny it.   This is a monumental play, one that can expose wall street tactics and forever change the power that the average American holds in the markets.   Good luck to you all, be safe, and lets get this party started. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!

Conflict of interest much? RobinHood makes money off processing trades one of them is Citadel who bailed Melvin!
‚ÄúInstead of orders being processed on a public exchange, companies like Robinhood can make money off of processing (or directing) trades through behind-the-scenes parties that provide the other end to the trade. According to Robinhood, they use market makers Citadel Securities, Two Sigma, Wolverine, and Virtu - which the company has disclosed due to SEC Rule 606.‚Äù     I already filed my complaint to the SEC.   Positions: BB, NOK, PLTR, LUMN

Clear Market Manipulation and heres why
Alas I am but a simple retard and this is my first post, but some thoughts on what's happening on the market manipulation as well as psychological manipulation.  By Friday they need the price to be below 115 to cover the 1/29 115p. This was part of the strategy. Let the stock run up during the week thinking retail is going to win. We all know by now that RobinHood sells its trading data to Citadel. As the price went up many investors also correlated their stop losses to the rising price setting stop losses higher. RobinHood saw this, Citadel knows about where the most stop losses are located. They trigger their short ladders and begin hitting stop losses which drives the price even farther down. On top of this many brokerages are only allowing you to SELL! Driving the price down even further as people whos stop losses were triggered can no longer buy in.  We need to HOLD for Friday and into next week. This is the drop to scare investors out hoping to avoid the squeeze. Don't fall for it. Find another brokerage and buy and hold. They cannot win if we work together!  IT WILL COME BACK AND GO TO MARS!!!!!!!!!! \ Rocket Ship\ \ Rocket Ship\ \ Rocket Ship\ \ Rocket Ship\

SEC Complaint Template - Market Manipulation
# Feel Free to submit a complaint like I did. Here's a starter.   Robinhood Markets, Inc. an American Financial services company engaged in market manipulation by restricting the ability of users to freely buy and trade stock. On 01/28/2021, with no advanced notice Robinhood Markets, Inc. removed the ability of users to buy shares in GME and removed GME from it's searchable offerings. This had the direct and immediate action of causing shares of GME to fall at least -44%. Robinhood Markets, Inc. actions had the clearly foreseeable impact of causing dramatic movement in GME share price and as a result, manipulated the market to lower the share price of GME.   Power to the players!

They've picked their side. We all know what the push down is. Market manipulation from the ones that were just crying about it. The shorters have still not learned their lesson and just keep digging in. As long as we hold they are fucked and I can't wait to see it.  I only have very few shares, just along for the ride    . Once they open it back up to buy its liftoff
You can still buy AMC and GME on SoFi. BUY THE DIP!
Don't let the hedge funds scare you. Keep in mind that AMC also went down because the company released more shares, in anticipation of the impending boom.  Switch to SoFi. Hold, buy the dip, because it will go up again!

Petition for class action lawsuit against Robinhood for market manipulation

By Blocking GME Buys, the market managers think they will make it die.... WRONG
This is a clear way to mitigate loses on shorts, but also it is a tool to depress the purchasing power of the little retards out here on.     What they want is people to lose faith in the stock, and to abandon it.     But in reality what they are doing is holding back people who desperately want to aquire it.     This is like high school teaching abstinence.     This is just making the moon men want it more!!!!     \>>>>>>>>>Side note BB! <<<<<<<<<

@RashidaTlaib This is beyond absurd. @FSCDems need to have a hearing on Robinhood's market manipulation. They're blocking the ability to trade to protect Wall St. hedge funds, stealing millions of dollars from their users to protect people who've used the stock market as a casino for decades.
Retail really got ducked today.
What are we going to do about it tomorrow?
GME tanked... I‚Äôm sorry, I couldn‚Äôt hold out
I had to buy more shares at 132
This is crazy, these people should be in jail. Link below to file a complaint with the SEC...

Robinhood has restricted trading to AMERICAN AIRLINES
This is  blatant coordination with short sellers. They had a killer earnings call today forcing a short squeeze and you can't buy more of the shares...  This is a huge deal, even compared to GME NOK and AMC. There is no way they can argue "protecting the consumer"
Looks like GME is off again, let‚Äôs take it to the moon
I'm in Canada and I just bought more GME
Cashapp has taken $GME off the list as well!
IMO move your portfolio to E-Trade. They are NOT blocking buys on any stocks.
Unlike the no commission trade companies like Robinhood or Webull, E-Trade charges a flat rate commission of $  per order placed. But as so they are acting like a professional company and not preventing their users from buying the stocks they like.   F the market manipulation happening and blocking of users from being able to buy stocks.
Buy the dips especiallyis your an international investor! Amazing at these prices!
We need to have our voices heard on other social media platforms!
To make sure we are heard we need to post on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. Otherwise the noise will stay here.
A graph of the 2008 VW squeeze next to GME today. Look familiar?
What is goin on with NAKD right now
YOU CAN STILL BUY GME ON FIDELITY
Just placed a limit order for 10 more shares; unsure of if it will get filled or not, but the order was entered and shows up under my Activities and Orders tab.
Welp, I think it‚Äôs about time to sell
SIKE BITCH, FUCK TD, FUCK ROBINHOOD, FUCK THE BOURGEOISIE. GME AND AMC TO THE MOON
Sad
It‚Äôs looking tough out there I‚Äôm down 50% on my recent AMC and BB calls, it‚Äôs getting hard to hold, but you know what. I‚Äôm not leaving, I‚Äôm not leaving, IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING!!!!
Trading 212 is down ??? Where else !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DO NOT SELL GUYS HOLD THE LINE AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHY
Mods please don‚Äôt delete this. My heart is hurting badly too but I need to explain why no one should sell now.  First off you don‚Äôt have to listen to me I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. Just someone smelling some bullshit.  Guys this is obviously a game. Here‚Äôs what just happened. They locked you out of being able to buy and you can only sell. They run it up making you feel good then BAM!! Short ladder attack wayyyyyy down it goes. I hope they didn‚Äôt shake many of you out but if you‚Äôre thinking of selling now DO NOT. You can‚Äôt buy back now and they want as many of us out as possible so they‚Äôre trying to scare you out as always. This thing is about to moon and they KNOW IT. That‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt buy more now. That‚Äôs why you can only sell. They want us out before we get to the moon.  DONT SELL.  ü§≤ GME
WILL WE BE ABLE TO BUY GME AGAIN?
I loaded up my account to buy this morning, and now I can‚Äôt. Will Robinhood let us buy again soon??? Any other brokers I can use to get instant deposit and buy now???? We must hold the line!!!
I‚Äôve never been into stocks and always thought this sub was a bit silly, but you guys are heroes dishing out karmic justice
Anybody who is investing in GME and is supporting this movement you have so much respect from me, it‚Äôs beautiful to see the culmination of everybody‚Äôs hatred for the corrupt .1% culminate into something real. I can‚Äôt invest but I‚Äôm watching from the sidelines as people put their life savings on the line just out of pure hatred for the corrupt. You guys are heroes, take GameStop stock to Saturn and it will be the one sign of any kind of real justice against the corrupt still in this bleak world.
They are afraid
GME not supported on Robinhood - I own no GME stocks

Buy motherfuckers Buy!!
10k by eod Friday.
PSA: Tastytrade will still let you buy gamestop. Fuck these other brokers that are trying to bail out their buddies
After all the retail brokers shut down gamestop trading it started to crash.  Right now there are only 9k shares available to short.  Don't let the big dogs keep you out of a good play.  Tastytrade gives amazing fills for options and has an amazing support team .  They also let you trade gamestop and have a very large amount of resources available for learning.
STILL HOLDING! NEVER SELL! ü§ö      ü§ö
Can We Get A List Of Brokerages That Still Allow GME Trades?
I've not opened my Etrade in a long time. I did because of this and it had $190 in cash, so I put in a GME order. It seems to have gone through.
Check Your Bid/Ask Spread!
I‚Äôm still able to trade on ThinkorSwim and these bid ask spreads are very telling.   AMC   GME 132/   Guys they want to buy your losses for PENNIES and are holding onto them for sick profits! The delisting is the last trick in the Hedge Fund book! Our Robbedhood brothers and sisters will soon find new brokers and WSB International will wake up to this atrocity and join the fight with us for Friday‚Äôs showdown.  It‚Äôs only money and we all die. Let‚Äôs send a statement and live forever.
Set your sell limits to the hundreds and thousands if you're going to set limits at all. only way to raise us to neptune without letting the shorts out
STONKS GO DOWN????
WAT?
About to experience my first margin call. STILL HOLDING! DON'T BE A PAPERHANDED CHUMP! HOLD!
in case you were wondering, I'm holding.
SIGN NOW! WE HAVE TO HOLD ROBINHOOD ACCOUNTABLE!

We touched the bottom of the day. NOW it will go back up. BUY AND HOLD
It's a great time to buy. GME is on SALE.
Citadel Pays Robinhood and is how Robinhood makes money. Citadel has   Billion Reasons for GME to crash.
I don't know if anyone as posted about this but if not, let's go some some of those class action tendies.
WE ARE GOING BACK UP! Please, we have to keep going. Robinhood is going down, Melvin and Shittron can eat a dick and cry about getting fucked.
Here are the links to file complaints with the SEC and FINRA for brokerages causing you to lose your money. Let's get loud. Posted inside.
I am not a lawyer. My understanding, to be clear, is that these brokerages are completely in compliance with the SEC and FINRA.   We should still fucking flood them. They need 3 million goddamn forms to sort and file for the next month to understand the gravity of what they are allowing to occur under their watch with antiquated policies that protect institutions at your expense.  This is absolutely fucking unacceptable. Hedge funds are openly and legally allowed to depress equity prices to their profit, while independent retail investors are left holding the bag.  CEOs and managers of major funds in 2008 that misled investors go handed parachutes, were yelled at a bit in congress, and went on their merry.   Where are those stock prices today? At all time fucking highs. BOA, WFC, GS, all of those players that bankrupted millions of Americans are part and parcel of the process now doing it again from the other side.   This needs to be the capitalist French Revolution. There need to be blood red shares in the streets of banks and hedge funds.   Smarter people who know better than me please post in comments better ideas on how to proceed from here. But let's get moving.
Holding!
Tomorrow is going to be iconic
DO NOT SELL GME
HOLD THE LINE DONT SELL GME
Fidelity still allows the buying of all stocks, buy there
Hold the fucking line
AMC IS RISING!!! HOLD HOLD HOLD!
I adore you bunch of fucking idiots. I was seeing a lot of red today, but things are taking a turn for the better. LETS FEED THIS SHIT UNTIL WE‚ÄôRE ALL FUCKING RICH BOYS!!! GME, BB, AMC, NOK... TO THE FUCKING MOON!
Fuck it I'm holding
not letting melvin win from this long ass GME battle
IF YOU HAVENT YET, BUY GME. STILL AVAILABLE OF FREE TRADE
ITS GOING UP YOU GLORIOUS BASTARDS
This is not financial advice it‚Äôs my opinion   HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD
Big Business supports slave labour and genocide on the Uigurs in China - yet they claim we're the "nazis" because we bought a stock that helps keep a videogame store from going bankrupt? - Am I takking crazy pills??? Am I retard?
Check out the list of companies that support slave labour and genocide.
Tried to buy the dip but looks like Webull is also preventing GME buys.
Forbes reporting in!!
ELON we need your help!!
Elon if you‚Äôre reading this, we need your help! Someone needs to make a stand for the people. For far long Wall Street has fucked us and now it‚Äôs our turn. I only ask you to stand with us and let it be known!
HOLD THE FUCKING LINE
ITT: WE HOLD THE LINE
Just bought my first share of gme. All I could afford to invest, just happy to support the cause
Fuck you Robinhood!!!! That‚Äôs all. Just a fuck you to elites.
See title. My options or actually worthless since they halted buying BBBY.
HOLD! FUCK THESE SUITS, SQUEEZE UNTIL THOSE COCKS GET POPPED
Green Vehicle Stonks
With Fleets needing to be electric/green in the US Govt, here are some stocks that may be worth a look.  RIDE $  - Lordstown Motors, electric pickup truck, production set for September 2021.  FUV $  - Arcimoto 3 wheeled trike but can be used for deliveries/rapid response  F $  - Ford, I think it will normalize electric trucks with the 2022 F150 Electric, price depending.
Important! Etoro just closed my share! I didn't do anything! F@ck
What should I do? I'll buy and hold but there's a loss already!
They are now manufacturing consent saying that it‚Äôs going down and people are selling I repeat no one is selling this is all market manipulation by robinhood and Citadel do not sell.
I'm buying BB from ETORO is that a good choice? (first time into stocks)
JUST BOUGHT 50 MORE IN THE SALE
THEY CAN'T STOP US LET'S GOOOOO
I'm done with Robinhood. I can sell, but not buy GME. If you try to search GME, it's not there and you only see GMED. Screw Robinhood!
Thank you guys and keep up the good work.
I'm an outsider looking in and seeing what you guys are doing as lit fire in me. The fact that the mainstream media their cronies these trading corporations and hedge funders are now trying to slander what you guys are doing here to me is unexcusable. Unfortunately I can't get in on the game now as Robin Hood and other traders have halted the stocks and are trying to force people to sell but if you guys keep going and if you find another stock to buy into I'll be right there. Keep fighting you're showing that the establishment has its weak points and weaknesses and that the populace can have their voices heard.
HOLD THE LINE
DISCOUNTS GALORE.  The paper bois have opened the door of opportunity. Diamonds are going to shine. TO THE MOON
Where can i buy the dip???
What options do i have?     I want to buy more!!  More GME, More AMC, More BB,  But how with all these retail online options not allowing the purchasing of any stock we've ever talked about on this sub.
They are trying to kill before pay day. HOlD
don‚Äôt sell
Webull blocking AMC buys (at $7)
Well thats fucking bullshit. $7 isnt even half of pre pandemic price.
HOW DO I BUY DIP?!
Fuck robinhood. Is there anywhere else I can buy the right right now?
Keep The Squeeze
Guys Sequoia Capital is a major investor in robinhood and the stock market. If we mass buy and then sell we could crash robinhood. This would also stop them from blocking us from buying and holding. We can keep the squeeze going.
BROKERS THAT STILL ALLOW BUYING GME
ALLOW BUYING GME:    # Fidelity  # Ameritrade  # E-Trade  # Degiro  (After 15q quiz)    DISALLOW BUYING GME:    # Robinhood  # Interactive Brokers  # Etoro  Comment other brokers and I will update the list
PSA: REVOLUT APP - YOU CAN'T BUY GME ANYMORE
This is outrageous. When you go to the trade screen and make an order it will be declined.
This might need to go in r/unpopularopinions, but hear me out: ROBINHOOD IS NOT THE ENEMY
I know you retards can‚Äôt read, so I‚Äôll keep the short.    STOP BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU    Everybody who is making posts about getting the SEC involved and Class Action Lawsuits against Robinhood can eat a dick.  This is exactly what Wall Street wants. They want us to get rid of this app that is tearing down their establishment.  Who the fuck got most of you in the stock game?  Who is helping us stick it to the man with these hot fucking tendies?  Most importantly, what would you do without Robinhood?  Robinhood is the vehicle that allowed most of us to board this glorious rocket to the stars.  Don‚Äôt turn on them at the first sign of trouble.  We‚Äôre angry, that‚Äôs for sure, but we knew this wasn‚Äôt going to be easy.  We just hit an asteroid field and we need to think about how we‚Äôre going to maneuver through, not just run around screaming at every time the ship gets hit.  We feel betrayed, but you know Wall Street is scrambling trying to find anyway they can take us down.   You know Robinhood can‚Äôt do this stupid shit forever, but if we turn on them now, we might as well turn this ship around.  TLDR; stop acting like  s to use and protect the hull of this spaceship.     WE LIKE THIS STOCK
How long can brokerages continue to restrict these stocks?
Seriously though?
What is the point of this? GME
What is the point of this? I understand the movement, but what is the point of throwing away money and only making wall street richer? People here do realize that the last people to put their money in will lose everything right? Hey, its your money. Enjoy.
Everyone with a stop just got taken out. BUY THE DIP
IT IS GOING BACK UP RETARDS FUCKING BUY THE DIP BEFORE ITS TOO LATE! NON-AMERICANS NOW IS OUR TURN TO DO THISSSS 1000$ HERE WE COME!!!!!!!
Tried to buy more on Webull, rip
GME - I bought to go to the moon... now I‚Äôm holding out of spite
To the moon boys. When they stop fucking with us and think it‚Äôs calm, that‚Äôs when we‚Äôll win.
NOK IS ON CASHAPP
IF YOU CARE AT ALL. MANY OF YOU HAVE PENDING ROBINHOOD ACCOUNTS.  AMC WAS BLOCKED ON CASHAPP AND ROBINHOOD.  QUE SYSTEM OF A DOWN!  HOLD HOLD HOLD

Robinhood bad.
Just took another bank loan to buy more BB, thought I‚Äôd share. This is not advice.
They are trying to hurt us.... past couple of days have been great for us, every moon ride has its bumps. You see how they are trying to hurt us? They are scared. Stick together and we can watch them burn! HOLD AND BUY BROTHERS AND SISTERS!
Down to 120, up to 150
GME stock dropped, so I bought two more and it went up right after. HOLD you glorious retards!
WE LIKE THE DISCOUNTS
By only allowing people to sell the stock and not buy, Robinhood is in turn causing the volatility. They are pathetic for claiming the volatility of stocks to restrict buying them on the platform
Hey   wanted everyone to know I AM HOLDING
HOLDING HOLDING HOLDING LOSSES DONT MATTER, NOW IM JUST ANGRY
Fidelity allowing for GME trades
I know a lot of y‚Äôall are finding yourselves unable to buy GME shares. Fidelity is still allowing their purchase. I‚Äôve been using them for years without issue. Get in there and buy the dip!
Robinhood just autosold my GME at $120
Right after the webull GME page 404'd, Robinhood lliterally removed the shares from my account entirely with a $120 per share payout and no prior order to sell at all. GME has also magically vanished from my lists and search function as well. What the hell is going on?
I‚Äôm still going to hold
Anyone knows why $SLV jumped up suddenly?
TLSS
How about you guys work your magic on TLSS next. I would greatly appreciate it!
ITS GOING BACK UP
TO THE MOON!  BUY THE DIP, IF YOU CAN  HOLD THE LINE SERGEANTS  DONT LET THEM WIN  DIAMOND HANDS  \-Not financial advice
Vanguard halting AMC trading
GME, BB, NOK HOLD! Double down on the dip if you have access to buy.
This is about principal now. They are trying to tour her us and scare everyone out of their positions. HOLD THE DAMN LINE! We are stronger together.
The elite class of the American capitalist empire has spoken: Proletarians shall NEVER be rich and the rich shall NEVER be touched by their filthy hands. Will you bend the knee or fight?
#Are you accepting this treatment? Are you taking the capitalist boot stepping on you?  You were deliberately fucked by the capitalist class. It's that simple. You are being told that you will never be allowed to take from those in power while those in power freely take from you.  This is a class war. And you are the proletarians that need to take back control. You were part of the beginnings of a true revolution.  You are now awake.  YOU MUST NOT BE BROKEN!  GME IS A GOOD STOCK! AND THE ELITES ARE   STEALING   FROM YOU!  #THAT'S WHAT CAPITALISTS DO: THEY STEAL! YOU ARE BEING STOLEN FROM! THESE HEDGE FUNDS ARE TAKING   YOUR   MONEY!  #THEY RIGGED THE MARKET SO THEY CAN TAKE FROM YOU!  IF YOU CAN'T WIN THE FIGHT ON THE MARKET BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYING DIRTY, YOU NEED TO TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE ACTUAL STREETS! SUE! PROTEST! GET THE PITCHFORKS READY!
LISTEN UP AUTISTS. THESE NEEKS AT 212 AND RH TRIED TO FUCK US OVER BUT THEY'RE FIGHTING A LOSING BATTLE. ONCE THIS IS ALL OVER LET'S PLAN A MASS EXODUS. EVERYONE MOVE TO BETTER FREER PLATFORMS WSB FOR LIFE
WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.
Notice how as soon as GME gains ground, it halts again. GME is still winning. I'm holding to keep winning.
Best Discount Ever!
Current price is the perfect opportunity to buy more!  There is only one outcome to GME and it's the Moon!
FIRE SALE üî• IS OVER RETARDS WE GOING BACK UP  KEEP HOLDINGüíç
Hope you got in good when that fire sale hit cus we bout to take off like a MOTHERFUCKER. $600 EOD EASY.
HOLD THE FUCKING LINE, TO THE MOON BROTHERS
me and the bois watching the chaos and eating popcorn
Is there any e-trade sites that are still allowing accounts to be opened? I‚Äôve tried Fidelity and e-trade but account creation is down.
Buy the dip
Wouldn't be surprised if Reddit forums are added to Bloomberg terminals
GME has bottomed out and is going back up. HOLD.
Robinhood Motto: Steal from the Poor and Give to the Rich
Now we know who‚Äôs with who. One stone two birds.
Just an reminder for you potential üìÑ (not financial advice)
UM CAN SOMEONE EXPLAINED WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
GME to the moon! Stand steady boys! It‚Äôs working!
Don‚Äôt be fooled by price manipulation. Float is on our side! Who‚Äôs ready to get rich?
THE FIRMS ARE JUST USING THE SHARES MUST HAD, STOP GETTING SCARED!!!
This is just a ploy dont fall for it
Alternative to Robinhood and IBKR
Can anyone offer some worthy alternatives to RH and IBKR where they don't bend over backwards and restrict us from trading in the supposedly free market.     Preferably that can handle large volume of transactions without lag and aren't chickenshit of a management.
Why I‚Äôm Holding GME
At some point the shorts are going to have to buy back what they borrowed. And when they do I will have a 12 car garage. Im holding steady and I‚Äôm buying the dip.
WE ARE STRENGTH IN NUMBERS ONLY BUY BB NOK AMC GME ALLLLLLLLL FUCKIN DAY AND WATCH THESE SHORTS COVER THIS AFTERNOON LETS GOOOOOO!!!!$$!$!$!$!$$!$!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!$!!!!!!!!!!!!$$$$
WE ARE STRENGTH IN NUMBERS ONLY BUY    BB NOK AMC GME    ALLLLLLLLL FUCKIN DAY AND WATCH THESE SHORTS COVER THIS AFTERNOON LETS GOOOOOO!!!!$$!$!$!$!$$!$!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$!$!!!!!!!!!!!!$$$$
GME has been halted more than its been open for trading today
Watch you limit orders         - They are being systemically cancelled by retail brokerages  -
Placed a limit sell order on GME through Ally invest, it was cancelled without warning, and I've been locked out of my account all day.     My guess - they removed the limit orders and access to be able to lend the shares for additional shorts to buy the hedge funds time.  Blocked buying so people couldn't buy the dip, and manipulated the market to give the funds time to recover something.
HOLD THE LINE. THIS IS THEIR FINAL STAND.
TLDR;  Don‚Äôt be a  üëè Bitch. Do not sell your    to the evil  . Have  üëè. Tomorrow we retards go to     This morning, the unthinkable happened. Many of us retail investors woke up to almost every major broker locking the option to purchase more shares in $GME and other stocks that we like under the bullshit guise of ‚Äúvolatility protection‚Äù.   They are all against us, even betrayed by Robinhood who we thought was supporting the little guys. Fuck them. This is IT. This is the day that men are made. Tomorrow the shorts have to cover their shorts (over 20% of their total investment) which will trigger a massive price squeeze which will launch it to the fucking moon  As long as you have   FUCKING üëè. All you retards have to do is not sell. As long as the price is above $200 plus (I‚Äôll edit if incorrect) they have to cover every single on of their shorts. They are bleeding and this is their final stand. They are on their fucking knees begging you to sell. DO NOT give them an out. They never would for you.   STAND STRONG MY BOYS. WE ARE ALL A PART OF THE MOST EPIC SHORT SQUEEZE IN HISTORY. FUCK WALLSTREET. IT IS OUR TIME.  $GME TO THE FUCKING MOON                                                     And oh yeah. We like the stock.
Wow how true. CRIMINALS
SNDL to 5 or bust
Fuck robinhood and big wallstreet we will do whatever we want I'm in if you can join my crusade. LETS TAKE THIS SHIT TO THE MOON
What the actual fuck is going on with TDA
Fuckers really don't want anyone to buy the dip. Wallstreet rlly had to use cheat codes on us huh.    Processing img zjlhi9tgo3e61...
ummmmm ouch
This isn't working! Sell GME while you can!
Now that the paper handed BITCHES are here.   GET OUT OF THIS SUB.  For the rest of us, DO NOT SELL. THE BIG HEDGE FUNDS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE US LOSE, INCLUDING PAYING OFF THESE TRADING APPS AND MAKING IT LOOK LIKE DIPS ARE OCCURING. THIS IS WHERE THE PAPER HANDS ARE WEEDED OUT FROM THE DIAMOND HANDS. DO NOT SELL NOW, WE HOLD OR BUY. DO NOT LET THESE GUYS WIN, OR THEY WILL DO IT AGAIN. WE HAVE TO HOLD.     Please do not give up after this long, keep it going.
NAKD GOONG TO THE MOON
WoooHooo $GME FIREBUY
Yaaaa babbyy all you paper handed bitches thank you!! I now own 10k worth of your shares at a very generous discount.   See you soldiers in my millennium falcon. We about to kessel run this bitch!!!                üèæ

You have all become the very things you promised to destroy
You guys are literally fighting each other and have been since $100. You guys are just echoing random conspiracies with no basis in reality. You bankrupted Melvin; that was awesome. Everything since then has been musical chairs between yourselves. You're not hurting anyone but each other. You're living in this fantasy world where you're going to take down Wall   no. Wall St has already made five times more off you just this morning than Melvin ever lost. You guys just donated literally billions and billions of dollars to wall street and you can‚Äôt even see the sad irony of it. I have never seen a group of people get played so hard. Pathetic.  The best part is everyone is leveraged to the moon trading options meaning you‚Äôre losing all this money   St funds and mega banks. So, one fund lost $3 billion and now a bunch of billionaires are going to make $40 billion+ off you retards. Fantastic plan you guys.   Once Melvin got out is when this stopped being funny. These losses are going to be spread out over the MILLIONS of members of this forum. You can bet at least several of them are going to kill themselves, at least tens of thousands will have their lives totally destroyed. Great job guys.  As for Melvin? He'll have to start chartering yachts instead of buying them. YOU GUYS became exactly what you claimed to be fighting against. You fucked millions of small people who joined this sub in the last 48 hours and some of you got rich off of them. Wait a minute, that almost sounds like what you accuse hedge funds of doing...  You guys literally promulgated a Ponzi scheme in the open and everyone was in on it thinking it would last forever and  , here we are. You guys all scammed each other and fuck every single one of you.
UK AND CANADA
BUY! They‚Äôre screwing us here in the US.  AMC/GME/BB/NOK!!!
YOU GUS ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT ON NPR
Tune into NPR   radio nyc / nj
It no one can buy GME on Robinhood, when you are selling your GME, who is allowed to buy GME? Hedge Funds, who shorted stocks at $350 yesterday.
This is how the big boys play!
MM and hedge funds play the game this way and have way more capital to do it.  Their goal is to scare  's psychological warfare to them.  Don't be   logical!     The game has just begun
HOLD AMC   YOU DONT LOSE MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL LETS GO BOYS
not financial advice     also LETS FUCKING GO BOYS DONT LET THE MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUNDS STOP US
With the SEC coming to the 1% aid today, I believe its time to stand together!
So uhhhh... time to Occupy Wall Street again? ü§î
So what are we buying next, considering we are being blocked with the current ones?
Halts and Short restriction for tomorrow
How long can they halt this all day?   If it drops enough it can‚Äôt be shorted tomorrow ya?
I submitted an SEC complaint against Robinhood for preventing trading of AAL to cover active institutional shorts.

Short interest is still above 100%
After this massive short attack, the best time to buy this week seems to be now.  Interest this morning    Change of ~13% as of 11:15  ‚Ñ¢  The funds have thrown all the money they can at shorting. They‚Äôve played their backrow getting brokers to ban buying.  The squeeze is coming soon. Why? Because they know it‚Äôs going to recover and this is likely their best price to buy. As soon as this starts going up they will settle. When that happens, forget the moon, Mars, even Pluto. This $h!t is going interstellar. ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è   üå†üå†üååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüååüåå  I think you‚Äôll easily see $500 tomorrow, and $1000 next week.  Positions: 11 Stock GME @$330  Obligatory: This is not financial advice, just the muse of a long long time lurker who finally did something.
Something for those of you on the verge of selling
Sell, and you‚Äôll make a   least a small one. And dying in your wife's boyfriend's beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade those tendies for one chance ‚Äì just one chance ‚Äì to come back here and tell those hedgefunds that they may get bailed out... but they‚Äôll never take our shares!
BB DIAMOND HANDS - Selling at 420420 only!!!!!!
HOLLLLLLLLLLLD THE LINE
It's the clearing houses boys.
CANT BUY AMC ON WEBULL NOW
Thanks RobinHood for canceling my order to buy 1 stock of GME
I ordered one share while the market was closed only to see RobinHood canceled it this morning. Fuck me for trying to get some money.
DONT SELL
ALL YOU MFs TALKING GME AINT THIS GME AINT THAT STFU! IT ONLY GOES UP FROM HERE  ü§≤ ü§≤ ü§≤
CANNOT REGISTER
This is pissing me off! EVERY trading website I have tried is blocking me from registration using one bullshit excuse after another!! They are  ACTIVELY SUPPRESSING OUR ABILITY TO GET IN ON THE MARKET!    Those who managed it, yay for you.
Consider that this dip is the outcome of coordinated actions against us. Even if the reason is just so bigger players can buy in at a cheaper price, they still just want you to sell. Counter their efforts with patience and we will win
Robinhood market manipulation, another thing you can do that isn't mentioned yet
Contact your state representative. They are always available to the public that voted for them. Contact them now, keep contacting them. Tell them you will not vote for them if they don't support a serious investigation of market manipulation by Citadel and others.
AMC HAS STOPPED DROPPING. IT'S GOING UP AGAIN
Just bought 2 shares of GME!!
I have a schwab brokerage account and they let me place the order!! Bought 2 shares at 132 each. Sorry I'm a retard who doesn't know how to reddit but wanted to get the info on how to buy out there!!!!
All of you degenerates holding GME..
How do you want to be remembered in this moment of history? A coward panic seller? Of course not. Let's HOLD and fight like hell. This current dip hurts but I refuse to lose. If we SELL.. We LOSE. Let's die on this battleground together knowing we fought until the very end and if we hold strong, we will come out on top.  TLDR: HOLD YOUR GME SHARES AND DO NOT GIVE IN.
Keep In Your Memory 28 January!
Keep In Your Memory 28 January The GME treason and plot; I know of no reason  Why the GME treason Should ever be forgot!

Review this trash ass app and make their reviews go to shit for this. GME to the moon boys
Dear Robinhood, I deposited $9k into your app and now you won't let me take it out. Please help.
It's one thing to remove the ability to trade a stock, but removing my ability to withdraw to my bank account is waaaay over the line. Never using this app again.
Right lads, retard chat about to commence. The prices were seeing here are absolutely fucking brilliant. They tell us how the nutcrackers are bricking it and trying to influence a sell. Our nuts, however, cannot be cracked. Buy the dip, sit back and watch it rise to the moooooooooooon!   HOLD
Me, a Brazilian, there's anyway I can help with the GME stocks?
Tell me and i'll do it. Fuck robinhood.
I‚Äôm awake! and SHORT STOCK DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. GSE BULLS BUY AND HOLD!!! (update for visibility)
Do. Not. Panic.
I REPEAT DO NOT PANIC SELL. This is their last pathetic attempt. They‚Äôre using bungee cords to try to hold down the goddamn rocket that WILL take off at opening tomorrow. Stay strong and buy the dip retards.  I don‚Äôt know anything about anything and I‚Äôm certainly not offering anyone financial advice. I just like this stock.

Square Cash App. The best replacement for Robinhood.
Just want to make a recommendation. Square Cash App is in my opinion the best alternative to Robinhood because of it built for mobile interface. Also, Jack Dorsey ain't no bitch and won't let regulators do what they want.
Hold Fast, My brothers!
The world is watching this. Countries worldwide are joining our cause.  First they ignored us. It failed.  Then they insulted us. It failed.  Then they disrupted trading brokers. it failed.  Stopping Robinhood and similar fuckweasels from buying stock is the latest in a long line of scare tactics that WILL. NOT. WORK.  We are millions strong throughout the planet united by our desire to make our lives better and those of our loved ones better. We will endure. We will fight. We will buy. We will hold.  NOTHING like this has ever happened in the history of finances, the history of the market, in the history of mankind.   Raise your swords, raise your phones, raise your fists if nothing else is available. Let us cry out in one voice!  WE. WILL. HOLD!!!!

which brokers are still allowing buys of GME?
Webull or Fidelity?
Seeing as I was about to start learning to invest this week and robinhood seems to be doing the sneaky sneak, I want to see if maybe an alternative is better to start off with.  So far I've read a decent amount of comments suggesting Webull or Fidelity, can anyone vouch or give me a suggestion of which one to choose?

THE SQUEEZE HASN'T STARTED YET THIS IS JUST A DISCOUNT! LOOK AT VW BEFORE IT WENT TO THE MOON
How long can they block me from buying GME? Surely there has to be some mechanism in sight to keep this from lasting forever
Realistically, can they keep the market closed for weeks so the funds have time to cover their shorts?
Too the smooth brains who don't understand what is happening
Hedge funds are rapidly shorting the stock using any strategy they can possible, there is not enough trade volume for them to force the price this low traditionally, so they are sinking it so low it halts each time it resumes preventing anyone from buying. They hope this scares people into selling so they don't lose all their money.   They sill need our shares!   Anyone who knows more than me please correct me on the finer points always down to learn more.   This is not financial advice and my business background is years of lurking here when this was almost only an options subreddit.
We're on the way back up bois!     Hold strong
Fuck Charles Schwab
"Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but operates it as an independent retail brokerage, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those stocks, including GameStop.  A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, limiting how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed ‚Äúrestrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.‚Äù  On Thursday, Interactive Brokers Group IBKR,   announced that as of midday Wednesday, it put GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry Limited BB,  , retailer Express Ltd. EXPR,  , and Koss Corp. KOSS,   option trading into liquidation only due to the extraordinary volatility in the markets. Meaning investors could only unwind their positions, not create new ones."
WE ARE IN THE FINAL STRETCH IT IS CERTAIN. STAY STRONG BROTHERS
The app webull works for gme!
On the App Store webull works for gme and is pretty similar to Robinhood. You can still buy there.
What platforms can purchase GME from?
Hot take from a dummy. AKA they are desperate
They are shorting the stock into oblivion hoping to induce a panic sell to get below the $115 calls. Don't fall for it. They will just be on the hook for more shares later. Hold strong.  Just a retard, this is not financial advice.            For those who haven't learned to read
This is the testament of Robinhood's future. I highly doubt it they will keep their userbase intact after all this done. Fuck Robinhood.

Reasons you shouldn‚Äôt sell anything right now
This applies for the following  ~~~~~ GME AMC BB NOK ~~~~~ Reasons not to sell:  You only lose money    IF YOU SELL   , so don‚Äôt sell.   We‚Äôre all going to the moon if we can hold and keep buying  That‚Äôs it. Follow my advice and we‚Äôll all be rich together
I will ride this to 0$ if I have to just to prove a point. Robinhood has made it clear that there is no real free market.
Can‚Äôt stop won‚Äôt stop BUY BUY BUY hello Fidelity goodbye Robinhood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's cheap, fucking buy. This is to be expected. Buying means winning.
In the midst of this chaos, is there any non-locked out stocks that I should be throwing in on? I have some money that I can't put on GME or NOK anymore.
Non financial advice only of course
Looking at options
Last year I noticed that when you are gaining in Robinhood it mysteriously freezes and doesn‚Äôt let you trade and it doesn‚Äôt let you cancel your order until it‚Äôs fulfilled at loss, so... I moved everything into webull and so far (up to today I have now had one single issue, actually I am making more gains than before) I think Robinhood is good in papers as a ‚Äúindie‚Äù broker... but now we see how they react when the market starts getting fun. I am pretty sure there is better brokers. So far webull seems like an okay option but if anyone has a better pls don‚Äôt hesitate to comment!
WSB next move ‚Äî leave Robinhood
Where to?
I'm going to be honest, I have always been a paper-handed b  ch ever since I started investing.
But not for GME. This is not just about the money. This is a CAUSE. This is doing whats RIGHT. This is being apart of a REVOLUTION. DIAMOND HANDS FOR GME AND ONLY GME.    LETS GOO. DONT SELL
Brokerage Firms have blocked GME, BB, NOKIA From being trades
Class action lawsuits needs all the brokerage firms that blocked people from being able to trade these companies. I don't use Robinhood, I use Charles Schwab. I just recorded myself using OBS trying to stocks from all these companies and wasn't able to. But I can purchase any other company..... If this isn't a clear picture of market manipulation I don't know what is, because of this the stocks have fallen for all these companies, especially GME.
At this point, I don't care if the rocket doesn't $MOON. I'd be happy if it just blew up the launch pad

Does transferring shares to another broker result in your shares being sold by one then bought by another?
If you open an account with another broker, how do the mechanics of the transfer work?  Are your shares sold by, let‚Äôs say RH (thereby giving shorts shares at depressed prices), then rebought by the new broker?  Or is it just a transfer of custodianship between brokers?  Also, what is the timing of the transfer?  Will it take a few days to settle?  Appreciate any insight into this.
ROBINHOOD WON'T LET ME BUY GME OR AMC??? FINE, I OPENED A FIDELITY ACCOUNT SO I CAN BUY MORE AT THIS DIP AND TRANSFER MY ENTIRE ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT TO FIDELITY

Just to start, this is not financial advice, might be the dumbest fucking thing in the world to buy more shit so make your own decision. That being said, fidelity is still allowing opening transactions for stocks that other companies are not. If you‚Äôre looking to buy dips you might want to look there.

You can use the chase banking app
Not sure if anyone else is doing it that way. But I've been using my chase banking app to buy GME and AMC stocks without a problem.  Just bought 21 shares of AMC without any restrictions.  To hell with Robinhood
This is similar to the 2008 playbook.
The institutions and hedge funds own the Fed and governments.  It‚Äôs a fact.  This is not a ‚Äúmarket‚Äù.    It is a Fed controlled momentum fueled bubble where true price discovery or value is non-existent.  It‚Äôs been this way from Greenspan in the 90‚Äôs onward.  Anything that threatens the status quo or the elites from continuing to get paid gets shutdown.

Payment for order flow and why RH is incentivized to suppress GME buying
Robinhood's business model involves selling trading data to large HFT and market makers to help them better understand where money is flowing in and out. Another huge portion of their business model is called "payment for order flow". RH has agreements in place to push x% of your retarded orders to various market makers in return for retarded amounts of cash.  One of the largest institutions on the otherside of RH is Citadel. We all know how anti-retard Citadel is but more importantly and recently, they did a full anti-retard and along with Point72 pumped another   into Melvin Capital    Whether explicitly or implicitly, Robinhood is highly incentivized to please their customers, except their customers aren't retards, they're market makers.   At the very least, it's not a good look, at the most, it's massive, coordinated market manipulation by retard hating big boys.
Webull is banning GME as well!

Boys, this is about principle now. Either we are 0 or they are!

The dip was predictable, same thing happened to Volkswagen in 2008 before
Todays dip was predictable, though, they tried this tactic already in a 1day cycle on Tuesday - this time around they tried it in two days. It is just them trying to emotionally attack stockholders. It means they are getting desperate but too much stock are in     obligatory     but this is a last ditch effort before jet boosts are engaged over the next week or so - same happened with Volkswagen it had a bit dip but then came all the way back up an more!  Volkswagen 2008 post squeeze:    Just remember, it is still massively shorted, that is all that matters.  But You have to wonder how invested are trading212, robinhood, etc. in the outcome of GME, AMC, etc. and if they tried to short them themselves or have investment from some of the hedgefunds (or friends) considering their actions the past 24-48hours.
Thanks for the huge dip
50 more shares in muh fuckaz
Apex Clearing (and likely others) are not allowing buy orders on AMC, GME, and KOSS. Before we throw robinhood or others under the bus, I‚Äôm not sure if they even had a choice. How high up was this decision made? All the way from USG I bet.
Hold the line.
If they are going to take us down, I want every dollar of treachery to sear within my flesh. I want the flames of sweet revenge to be fanned by their arrogance and treason. We will strike back with a vengeance the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen in a world where financial democracy has been neglected for millennia. We will rise from the ashes.
The irony is that RobinHood is trying to steal from the poor to give to the rich.
What a shameless act.
Someone better go to jail for the blatant manipulation.
What are the regulations in terms of halting a stock constantly like this?

What is happening and what we should do now!
What is happening right now?  Robinhood has blocked GME and AMC and it is no longer possible to buy these stocks at this point. As we have seen, it is clearly depressing the price and many traders will partially close their positions. In my opinion, this really borders on market manipulation, but that's for others to decide. Who is behind this decision, whether it is government, hedge funds or RobinHood itself, is unclear. But it clearly means that we have pissed on their leg properly and we are on the right track. There is no way this should make us give up! They are probably trying to divide us. They want us to move away from GME and AMC and focus on other values. The goal is very likely that we will all spread our capital over several stocks and the concentration on GME will decrease. They can't succeed with this!   What will happen?  What has not been considered in this action is that this setback will only make us grow closer together and our will is stronger than before! The community has more than doubled in size in the last few days and our influence has increased as a result. We have the ability to fight back stronger than they can even imagine. As soon as RobinHood releases GME and AMC again the reaction will be very strong. Once we all find an alternative to Robinhood, we will invest there and drive the price back up.  What should we do now?  We should not sell! Through this action we see that we are doing everything right and we should not let this upset us. We need to find alternatives to continue buying GME and AMC. We could work with VPNs and thus trade via European markets and brokers or we look for alternative brokers in America that allow us to do so. We must not let ourselves be divided! We are more users than ever before and are at our strongest at this point in time. We must use this situation to our advantage!
Time to Kill Robinhood
Alright boys and girls, after the dust settles we all need to move to a better trading platform.
What app/site are people using to keep buying?
Stocks are still fluctuating so people must be finding a way to keep going right?
Now is the time to buy GME!
Locking shit down
They are locking shit down by hiding it on multiple platforms now. This is market manipulation, it's the equivalent of knocking the gamepad out of the other players hands when you are loosing. Look for other options like BB and NOK. Keep your heads on a swivel.
Fuck Robin hood
We have seen it now and they will do it again. After this whole thing is over we should all boycott Robin Hood and use other trading platforms. Fuck them and remember HOLD
ROBINHOOD ALTERNATIVES
Webull:  Somewhat complex interface for new traders. If you want to try it out you can get the app and the desktop app without an account or anything.  No fees tho. Make sure you can but because I‚Äôm seeing a lot of people saying you can‚Äôt. Fractional shares available   Loved:   Simple user interface but it‚Äôs mainly made for long term investing but you can invest without any fees. Fractional shares is the only way you can invest.   Main thing about Loved is that it also has custodial accounts.   If there are better alternatives put them in the comments and I will do my research and edit this post to help others.
Anyone else unable to get Fidelity to verify their identity?
Been trying to apply for an account today. Whenever the site doesn't crash or freeze on me, the application seems to go directly to a "we couldn't verify your identity page." Never had an issue like this before with other accounts/apps.

RH now SHAFTING AAL among other stocks with recent rises(GME, AMC, BB, NOK, NAKD)
Seems they're increasing their 'blacklist' of any stock with a recent rise. Shit is disgusting. Notice the price falling as well the moment it became unbuyable on RH.
AMC, NOK, GME all seek lawsuits on major online trading platforms...
Isn't this a no brainer idea?  AMC management should be LIVID that their company's stock is only allowed to be sold. Fucking ridiculous. I hope they take action.

Been searching and trying to find somewhere saying when Robinhood will lift all these restrictions but can't find anything. Anyone seen anything on this?
ITS GOING BACK UP KEEP HOLDING

Stay Strong
I'm seeing GME and AMC fall, don't panic sell guys. Keep calm, don't play into their hands, we have done so much change that event the governments around the world can't ignore us.  an excerpt from We All Lift Together by Keith Power: "And we all lift, and we're all adrift together, together.

GME Stonkholder‚Äôs memo to @ryancohen
The views and opinions in OP are mine and mine alone.  All comments are likely opinions of other stonkholders.    TLDR;    WE LIKE STONK  @ryancohen make changes to $GME  WE LOVE STONK    Executive summary:    There is one thing the hedge funds that are shorting $GME are correct on, no denying it.  GameStop‚Äôs current retail business model is dying.  To survive GameStop will need to modify their business model to fit the trends of their consumers.  They‚Äôre not doing it right now and if that doesn‚Äôt change the company will have a similar fate as Blockbuster.  I like the stock because I‚Äôm from a generation of gaming and my kids will be another generation of gaming.  Gaming is not about retail anymore; you buy your game in the marketplace for the platform you are using.  This shift in retail isn‚Äôt limited to the gaming industry ‚Äì look at retail and Amazon.  Right now, I like the stock because I like gaming and I also like to make money.  The stock is making me money.  But without a change in GameStop‚Äôs business model, I‚Äôll likely stop liking the stock once it‚Äôs not making me money anymore.  So how does @ryancohen and $GME make me love the stock?  They reinvent their business model to fit that of the gaming industry currently.    My opinion on where $GME‚Äôs retail model needs to be modified is into more of a service industry model with a bit or retail.  Kind of like $CBRL, but good.  Tell me, why are GameStops not being retrofitted to support eSports?  Is there a reason a whole other industry is breaking into GameStop‚Äôs marketplace?  Why don‚Äôt GameStop locations have ability to support LAN play?  Online play isn‚Äôt just about playing with other people.  There‚Äôs a lot of playing with actual friends that takes place.  Why do GameStop locations not have a place where people gather to play?  Why are GameStop locations not hosting eSports tournaments? You have space in your retail locations that can be repurposed.  The space obviously is not being utilized to its potential at the moment.  So what about $GME‚Äôs current retail strategy could be used?  Likely none of it outside of their sundries.  But what if they dumped their current retail strategy for even more service and less retail?  Some folks still like holding games.  A game in the case is somewhat of a trophy from the past to some.  But these folks are obviously not coming out in droves, right?  Maybe purchasing used games for pennies is the wrong retail strategy.  Maybe renting and then selling the trophies is a better model?  Maybe I just want to play all the latest games but can‚Äôt afford to buy every physical game, but a three-day rental is nothing.  There are a lot of folks that believe in $GME.  That‚Äôs partially what‚Äôs been driving this crazy week.  There‚Äôs a few hedge funds that are trying to eliminate $GME and the jobs of all their employees.  And then there‚Äôs /r/wallstreetbets liking the stock to save jobs and put faith in something they enjoy. $GME owes it not only to their employees but their stonkholders to reinvent their business model.  They should also give me tendies to set this up for them. Got to get those pings lower‚Ä¶  Any other stonkholders have ideas to help $GME save their employees?

Brothers-in-law sisters of the land.
The main culprit of this manipulation are the hedge funds. They have called their allies and the brokers are coming to aid them. They thought they were untouchable. We touched them and their wife‚Äôs boyfriends. They finally said ‚Äúenough is enough‚Äù. There are plenty of brokers that aren‚Äôt gay like Cashapp. Pullout of Robinhood and non free market brokers. I‚Äôm doing my part already 1000 shares of NOK and GME. Will you? Fuck the institutions, it‚Äôs the people‚Äôs time to rise and spray our loads on their faces.   TLDR: move to Cashapp (the best broker) and fuck the institutions

DO NOT FALL FOR THE TRAP
GME is currently down 60% as we speak. It's a trap. DO NOT SELL, HOLD YOUR POSITIONS, THE SHORT SQUEEZE HAS NOT EVEN STARTED YET. We may have just discovered that certain brokers are crooked: I implore you, the number one thing to do IS STILL TO HOLD.   IF YOU LIKE THE STOCK, KEEP YOUR BALLS IN IT. THE PAPERWORK WILL COME LATER, AFTER WE FEAST TOGETHER.    The real threat right now is this:   DO NOT BREAK THE RULES.   If we break any rules and incite any form of manipulation ourselves, THEN ALL THIS WOULD'VE BEEN FOR NOTHING. DO NOT SUCCOMB TO DESPERATION. They're the real ones getting desperate, and while I'm typing this with my balls are bleeding, I like this stock so much I'll keep withering in the pain till I die.  I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, JUST A RETARD WITH 69 CHROMOSOMES. GODSPEED!!!!!  #
FOCUS ON ONE TARGET! DO NOT DEVIATE! AMC AMC AMC
Deviating from one stock to focus on others will lead to a smaller success or, worse case scenario, failure with the 1% taunting us once again. Focus on the primary targets GME and AMC.   Stocks that aren't available everywhere are NOT good targets. SNDL is low because it isn't as available as the like of AMC, GME, BB etc.   Trying to bring focus to other stocks rarely mentioned or just not mentioned at all on Reddit is a pointless endeavor.  GME succeeded because it was a focused target. DO NOT DEVIATE! INVEST IN AMC

Once the bs with robinhood settles, the stock will skyrocket to even higher numbers, I am talking $1K easy. DO NOT SELL, HOLD. THIS IS WAR. We will win, trust the sub.   Meanwhile open a webull account or a fidelity account. WE ARE MAKING HISTORY.
WE HOLD DAMNIT

They are trying to break us. But  is the hardest material there is. Hold.

It‚Äôs over boys. Thanks for the ride.
Fuck the rich. This fight is over. The next one begins.
Hold/buy all you can for GME, NOK and AMC etc.
If you can buy more do it and HOLD ON WITH DIAMOND HANDS. This is the breaking point don‚Äôt sell or the suits win and we loose out big.
Quick, which other app for free trading??
VOLKWAGEN DIPPED LIKE FUCK RIGHT BEFORE ITS SQUEEZE TOO

HODOR! HODOR! HODOR!
Never forget. Hold the door. GME to the moon.
Robinhood was fun while it lasted.
I'm not a sub here, but I do read WSB posts regularly and use Robinhood. I do not own GME or any of the "controversial" stocks.  Robinhood no longer allows me to search or view GME. The only thing I can conclude from this is that Robinhood does not care about me, nor does it have any interest in my financial wellbeing, but instead seeks to control me.  As a result I will be moving my Robinhood investments to my Fidelity account. Just thought I'd share that.
We‚Äôre backkkkkk!!!
Vlad tenev said they are empowering us with RH now look what he is doing. Fk him.
Fuk Vlad CEO- RH    this is not a hate speech.
Silly Trading Algos, we are austists
Lets go double dip at 120
Robinhood pulling this tells us we are winning pussies!!!
We knew this day would come! They are afraid of the the fact they are gonna have to pay up tomorrow! We knew this!
Here we go boys, somebody pushed the launch button. Hang on tight!!!!
AMC, the best value investment in the market
Best value play in the market today.  Just did an emission and got 300 million fresh cash.  Market cap:   billion Assets: 9 billion Revenue 2019: 5,4 billion
They want to play dirty? They have no idea who they are dealing with. Lets take it all down.
These brokers want to play dirty, not allowing people to use their own money to buy American stocks?  What's stopping a coordinated effort for us all to cash out our entire portfolios and take the whole market down?     Disclaimer: im retarded
WERE ON THE WAY BACK UP
CANT HOLD US DOWN BUT WE CAN HOLD ü§≤ü§≤
I think with people trying to recover their losses and others wanting to profit off that recovery, GME is bound to bounce back up.
Game On
Please keep everyone updated on plataforms where you can buy GME
As the post says let everyone know who is still trading gme
GME vs VW chart
this looks pretty similar to VW before the squeeze      ü§≤  STILL HOLDING TILL THE END
That bid / ask though... YOLO
SENS should be the next move. 39% short interest and currently   a share.
They blocked off GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. I think SENS will make a better squeeze than the ones being pumped in NAKD, CTRM, and SNDL. Lets raise money for diabetes while squeezing them out of this position as well!!   What do you guys think? Should we get this one going?
What they don't understand, what other fucking choice do we have?
I've entered GME 3 times and on the peak losing 30-50% value the next few hours. And 2 times I saw fellow retards coming back for me again. And I just did my biggest today at 380, and looking at my money vanish in 2 hours. What choice do I have? Lose most of that money in a day and call it quits, or believe in the dream and let the mechanisms that are there and can't be avoided play themselves out? I am holding because we never had a choice. I am holding because this is what they don't want us to do.
How to buy gme?
I got robinhood only to find they have hidden it from there search. Now I see a tip post says americans can't buy gme?  How can I buy it?
An homage to you, fellow spaceship riders
Long time lurker, short time rocketship rider here. What started out as a meme to me has now evolved to something much more than that. My eyes have been peeled back from the speed at which we are all traveling to the moon. Every one of you lads and lasses here are making waves in which the world has never seen. Hold the fucking line
To the Hedge Funds and their friends
For years, Wall Street has gotten away with bad faith practices if not outright financial crimes. When caught, they typically receive a slap on the wrist. Now suddenly, a bunch of regular people on the internet caught you guys with your pants down, and you're calling for investigations and increased regulation against retail investors.  Tough. Shit.  You can't live in the Wild West and then complain when the townsfolk buy guns too.
Does anyone else use STASH? If so, is it acting cursed for you also?
The app is not letting me view/access any of their pages, and also momentarily locked me out- I‚Äôm trying to buy the goddamned dip.  Hold the line my friends, let‚Äôs get fucking rich  ü§≤
GME Tumble - Sorry everyone.
I bought GME today.  Every time I cheer for the underdog, the underdog gets shot.  Dammit.  So sorry.
THE HIPOCRACY
WE GOT IN TROUBLE BECAUSE WE LIKED THE STONK OF A COOL COMPANY AND THEY CALLED IT ‚ÄúMARKET MANIPULATION‚Äù. BUT THEN THE MOTHERFUCKING MARKET MAKERS GO ON LIVE TV AND SAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO FREEZE RETAIL INVESTORS TRADING SO THAT THE BIG MONEY CAN  PROP THEMSELVES AS US THE LITTLE MAN GOT SQUASHED AND STUCK IN STOCK TANKING -50%. THAT IS WHY ON MONDAY OR WHICHEVER DAY THEY REALIZE THAT THIS IS ILLEGAL WE ARE GONNA RETALIATE HARDER THAN EVER BEFORE SHARES ONLY NO OPTIONS  Im not a financial advisor  WE ARE GETTING OUR TENDIES AND ANYONE WHO GETS IN THE WAY SHALL BE COLLATERAL DAMAGE. SOLDIERS LOCK AND LOAD AS WE PREP FOR THE STONK REVOLUTION.
Cant wait until...
.. Certain medias are gonna try to paint the picture that people suddenly realised the ‚Äùfundamentals‚Äù and started selling. Nothing shady at all going on here, no no. ü§°
If you missed out on GME, now is your chance. Shorts will buy to cover now.
That is if you can find a non-corrupt broker to actually buy from. 200c Weeklies or Monthlies look good if you have the underlying capital. If not, then shares (yuck)
Hey Cap, On Your Left.....
IT'S COMING BACK, JUST HOLD THE LINE, THIS ISN'T THE ENDGAME YET!!!!
Ban all accounts that still use robinhood
This is war, robinhood did us all dirty, class action lawsuit is imminent. I propose we ban all reddit accounts that post gains and losses with robinhood, we will not be apart of them anymore it's over

I have been so inspired by all of you glorious retards. You have lit a working class fire in people today.
DONT FUCKING SELL        Reading yalls stories about the 08' collapse and how Wall Street was never held accountable is lighting a fire.  A fire of solidarity among the have nots and today Shittron will be a sacrifice on the alter of progress.  Stand together and stand proud that you have started hammering away at their ivory towers.  Solidarity and may the workers of the world unite in punching a hole in these fat cats wallets.
Blocked From Buying GME Shares on Robinhood? Get Your PARENTS Involved! They may be interesting in buying GME on THEIR BROKERAGES.

How can I, as a little guy, buy AMC right now?
After spending yesterday getting my Robinhood account set up I was fairly angry this morning to find they had suspended trading on AMC and GME. Is there any alternative platform I could use to buy?
Are there apps like Robinhood that didn't shut down buying?
And if there are, can we all collectively move to them from Robinhood after GME is done? This movement is about punishing hedge funds, and Robinhood is clearly with them, so we should punish them too and reward those that didn't shut buying down
Came for the gains, gonna stay no matter what!
To be honest, I came here to make some bucks but after reading what's happening I made up my mind. I don't care if I "lose" all my money, I'm not selling no matter what.   To me it's an investment to say FUCK YOU to those hedge fund managers.      Also, boycott every company and give them an honest rating or report anyone supporting those fraudsters.     We are all different individuals fighting for the right cause. Viva la democracia.     Support from Germany
Is Citadel behind the GME purchase restrictions?? Tinfoil hat time
Citadel is partnered with Melvin:     Citadel also pays for order flow from Robinhood, Interactive brokers, TD and some others. For you smooth brains this means they pay these brokers to let them execute the trade. It's basically where Robinhood makes their money because they don't charge you for trades.      Could Citadel be pressuring these platforms to limit GME purchases to help out their wall street buddies?? WE NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS!
It was a hell of a ride boys.
Never in my wildest dreams did I think the stock would reach 420. I think we achieved our goal of putting these hedge funds in their place. But I think it's the end of the road for GME.
Every single time AMc is released from there artificial halt it rises !!!     fux these haters !!!
Really crazy how scared they are of us rn. They halt amc and try to force paper hands to sell at really low prices don‚Äôt do it!!
should i go all in at 150?

Call your Senator or Congressperson!
MODS Please do not remove, this is the way.  Don't   let them get away with this. We the Retards need to use our actual   right to assembly to make real change. We proved the game is rigged now   let's bring it home. Let's make some real change.   Collective power isn't limited to wall street.  You're locked out of robinhood? Don't sell and Call your Senator.  They froze trading? Don't sell and Call your Congressperson.  Explain   to the polite intern who answers what is happening in a calm  reasonable  voice. Explain that it is wall street who is acting  irresponsibly. That  wall street was stuck in a bad trade and wall  street changed the rules  to ensure they always finish on top. Remind  them that the US Government  bailed out the banks in 2008 and left our  parents out to dry. If they  want us to believe the system still works  there should be investigations  into citadel and robinhood. This is  untenable.  I  have time, if you  have time, keep calling until they do something. If  we do nothing they  will side with the banks again. Send them a post  card, send them an  email, call them a 7th time.

ATTENTION HEDGE FUNDS AND ASSOCIATED SHILLS: YOUR ACTIONS BELIE YOUR DESPERATION!
This is only the beginning of a new paradigm in which the collective hive mind holds as much power over the stock market as these multi-billion dollar hedge funds. Not even government could hold these fucks accountable when they stole from the poor to funnel to the rich.  And yet here we are shoving our weird autistic cocks into their gold lined assholes and making them vomit money with every thrust.   Think about how monumental of an accomplishment that is.   Momentum and public opinion is on our side folks. Fossilized precedent is literally cracking under the weight of our collective autistic will alone! We have an opportunity to punish these life ruining, morally bankrupt institutions.   TLDR: BLEED. THE FUCKERS. DRY!!! BUY THE DIP AND HOLD TO ANDROMEDA  HOLD THE LINE RETARDS. WE LIKE THE STOCK!!!  (I am not a financial advisor, just less retarded than a Melvin Managing Director)
Did they halt trading indefinitely on GME? Short ladder attack left stock at 130$
Was watching the sell bids rise and drop on RH when they halted trading.  Saw it happen several times today.  Are they restricting the stock entirely?
Coordinated "atrack"?
With the blocking of buying GME in America on a bunch of trading platforms, do we thing this was planned to coincide with the massive price drop? So that none of us could buy at the dip?
When will we be able to buy GME, AMC, and NOK on all platforms again?
Obviously locked out along with everyone else, I want to buy but can't. When will this bullshit be lifted?
Down $4k holding the line with you tards
This is a statement at this point. Fuck the system if the system can just change the rules to appease these hedge fund fuck boys. I‚Äôll let my position go to $1 before I give them my shares.
I'm still holding
please tell me it will be okay
This is Hope, never sell.
It ain‚Äôt over retards
Hold till Friday
Why you should hold $GME
You actually need a fucking reason? It‚Äôs on sale you should be doubling down retard
I'm begging you, you apes, please hold
For those moving from Robinhood
Consider ETRADE. Their website and regular app are garbage, but look into their Power ETRADE product. It hasn't ever failed me. You can access it by logging into ETRADE and clicking the "Launch" button next to where it says Power ETRADE. Look for Power ETRADE on the app stores as well.
Can I get some help with investing

Robinhood is Stealing From the Poor to Give to the Rich
Robinhood has proved time and time again that they are nothing but weaselly little corporate shills who are to busy sucking off hedge fund managers so they can sell our information and make a quick buck off us I'll include multiple reasons why you should take all your money out of Robinhood and put it in other reputable brokerages like interactive brokers and Charles Schwab .       ## 1. Free Trades Are Now Commonplace   Robinhood is no longer the only show in town. Since its arrival, several major brokers have followed suit and now also offer free trades. Today, you can get free trades with Webull, M1, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E\ TRADE, Interactive Brokers, and many more. It means you need to question whether some of Robinhood's other major shortcomings are still acceptable. In practice, they are probably not.     ## 2. Major Downtime Problems  When a broker is inaccessible on some of the most volatile days of the last 50 years you may get some small outages . But Robinhood has consistently had major outage that led people to lose millions of dollars . Not once. Not twice. Not three times but over five times.  Worse still, all the outages occurred in the space of one week in early March during the most unpredictable days of the COVID19 crisis. It cost people millions of dollars in positions they could not close. And Robinhood's response? A "goodwill" payment of $75. It is now facing multiple lawsuits over the issue.   Users can no longer maintain any reasonable faith in the service being available when they need it most. That alone is enough reason to switch broker.     ## 3. Delayed Stock Quotes  If you read Robinhood's FAQs or independent reviews of the service, you will see that the app has real-time quotes.  That's only half true. Yes, your orders will always be completed at the real-time price, but the charts and data you see on screen are often delayed. This will prevent you from getting in and out of trades in the most efficient manner.     ## 4. Terrible Crypto Product  I understand the appeal of being able to do your stock trading and crypto trading in the same place. On paper, that's something that Robinhood offers; it launched its crypto trading service in 2018.  But the crypto platform has some shocking drawbacks. The drawbacks are so severe that we'd strongly urge all users to look elsewhere for your crypto needs.    Coin withdrawals are not available. If you own Bitcoin, you cannot transfer it out of Robinhood to your own private wallet.   Robinhood does not supply you with access to your wallet or your wallet address.   You do not hold the private keys for your crypto assets. An oft-repeated (and accurate) piece of advice in the crypto world is that if you don't have the private keys, you do not own the coins.     ## 5. Payment for Order Flow, Selling Your Data and Poor Execution  Given the free trades, how does Robinhood make money? Sure, there's Robinhood Gold, but the signup rate is nowhere near enough to warrant the $8 billion company valuation.  The answer is via a practice called payment for order flow. It means that instead of searching for the best price for a given stock, Robinhood is instead selling your data to high-frequency trading (HFT) firms for massive profit. The HTF firms add the data to their algorithms to better understand the flow of retail money. It is they who are Robinhood's real customers.   In reality, the no-fee movement may end up being described as a no-explicit-fee movement, as the payment for order flow revenues have grown at many of these firms. Not to rehash the whole argument, but investors trading at firms with higher PFOF are paying a hidden fee in terms of poorer execution on their trades.   This means that they may pay a higher price when buying or get a lower price when selling than they would with another broker less focused on PFOF as a revenue generator. For regular investors making only a few trades a year, PFOF-related slippage may not be a huge burden, but it is a bigger issue for more active investors and traders.      ## 6.Robinhood Gold is a Scam   Robinhood Gold is a subscription service that introduces a few extra features for $5 per month.    Margin investing.   Access to professional research such as Morningstar reports.   Level II market data.   Larger instant deposits (rather than waiting for money to clear).  Sounds reasonable. But here's the catch any broker worth its salt will make all that stuff available for free on its respective platform. It really isn't worth $5 per month. Robinhood Gold just feels like a way to eke more cash out of inexperienced investors who think that by subscribing they will become better traders.  ## 7. Poor Customer Service  Robinhood's customer support is notoriously bad. Users complain of waiting weeks for an answer in the app's Help section, lengthy queues to speak to someone on the phone, no responses to emails, and a general lack of urgency in responding to important issues.  In ordinary circumstances, poor customer service might be forgivable in a free app. However, when large sums of money are involved, clients deserve better. Given the company's value, we're sure they could hire a few extra reps easily enough.     TLDR: FUCK ROBINHOOD BUY GME ELSEWHERE                              Sources:
DO NOT SELL!! I HAVE FRIENDS DOWN 50% STILL HOLDING !! Remember, IT‚ÄôS NOT A LOSS UNTIL YOU SELL!! HOLD !! BUY MORE ON OTHER PLATFORMS!! FIDELITY IS WORKING FINE, SCHWABB, WEBBULL, ETC. $GME $BB DO NOT SELL!!!!!!!!!!!
They also limited transactions on GME and AMC in DEGIRO (Europe)
GME The SHORTS are closing. ITs fking rigged I know, hurry get out.
Guys i am no gay bear.  Before It halted, I saw the suits coordinate their buying and selling.  And i saw a huge volume on the bid side went through.     They are fking deciding their own price to close the shorts. I don't think we will see the short squeeze. Flame me whatever. Just take what you want from this.
WeBull is not allowing us to buy either
Where can we buy these stocks? $GME $AMC $NOK $BB $BBBY $NAKD I honestly can‚Äôt believe this. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it
Read if your new
If you‚Äôve bought GME today or yesterday and are down loads and thinking of selling or already have then all jokes aside your being stupid, first off always do your research before investing your money, and if you have even spent 5 mins looking at the posts here you‚Äôll see countless people saying hold this dip won‚Äôt last forever, you‚Äôve seen one minute of red and gone fuck I‚Äôve lost all my money and sold that‚Äôs on you, the whole point is to hold to the shorts can‚Äôt get out easy stop posting your losses it makes other weak minded people think about and potentially sell aswell, just hold and if your getting scared and worried just take the next available profit and leave the stock market because it clearly isn‚Äôt for you   TL;DR just hold it‚Äôs literally been said 1000s of times  GME 68 shares at @21  10 shares @320  Obligatory

Is this inaccurate data? Showing all short interest is gone now?
I have sent a support ticket to close my robinhood account
As the title suggests,  I have sent a ticket to close my account. Feel free to use my message as a template.   "Hello, I hope your day is going well. I am looking to close my account due to the volatile actions of your company and by extension your parent company CITADEL. Preventing free market trade and artificially reducing demand, and there by volume of market, is market manipulation as defined by the SEC. I realize I do not hold much weight with your company, however I am one of many."  Is there anything else I can do as a schmuck with no money?
GME DIP AS A TOOL
The squeeze is still coming as short positions start to come due, no matter what happens to the price. If you're worried about it, just buy in and think of it as dollar cost averaging.      Im not an advisor and I dont know shit about anything. Stonks go up and I like this one.
PUTS! CHECK THE PUTS!!
I'm somewhat new to trading (little over a year), but is there a way to check put calls purchased? I'm betting that the corpos bought crazy low puts yesterday afternoon knowing that they were going to halt any buying so people would panic sell and they could make all their money back?!      Or I'm just a dummy.
If you can hold on
You will be telling your kids about this on a yacht one day.  Don't give in, don't sell, but at discounts Not financial advise, I'm retarded.
üö® LISTEN UP RETARDS: üö® do you not see what is happening? Robinhood et al are preventing BUYING particular stocks so that you will want to withdraw funds and go elsewhere (but you won‚Äôt be able to buy!!). This effectively helps the suits
WE. LIKE. THE. STOCK.
Actual legal implications of this situation
Are there any actual securities lawyers or law students specializing in securities that lurk/use this sub that can give some insight into that actual possible legal ramifications from this situation?
Here's what's happening. Relax. Hold.
GME has dipped,  temporarily . I've been watching the numbers via Schwab's realtime stream. Here's what I've seen over the past 45 minutes.  GME fell about 25% in a 5 or so minute window, then trading halted. It was released, fell by the same amount, then halted. Repeat, halted. At each halt, I watched the volume continue to climb for a few seconds and then stop. Likely just orders being filled as the dust settles. But then, the volume ticked up by no more than 4 during the halts. These are the big bois.   Then a halt occurred at 126. GME was released, quickly climbed to 132, halted. It did the same, up to 155. Now 196.   This likely means that shorts who kept shorting on the way up over the past few days were successful in covering their >$126 shorts. They did this to hedge against their original, massive losses. There have been some good posts about this that I can't find right now. Someone please link those if you have them.  Anyway, good for the shorts. They managed to grab  peanuts . These are likely also smaller shorts scrambling to cover at a fire sale, knowing this thing won't go any lower before tomorrow's blowout.   Why am I telling you to relax? Recall that this whole thing started in the low double digits. There's still a  massive  amount of money they need to cover, and now more than ever, they're getting desperate.   Part of this too was probably people jumping ship from Robinhood, selling their shares and calls only to pick them up on whatever platform they land on.   This was very likely part of Citadel's coordinated RH maneuver.   Brutal, as they basically sank RH's reputation to protect their losses. How do we react? Simple.   If you intend on jumping ship from RH,      do so next week but keep holding for now.    It costs you nothing to hold.  Anyway, trading's released and we're back up to 200. Relax, the plan is still in place. Go crack a cold one and enjoy the skyrocket for the rest of the day. We're winning. Stay focused.
Lets help those who can't buy find where they can
Guys, it's ok to complain but does anyone have alternatives for where those who can't buy now can purchase?
Was finally able to buy GME on SoFi!
Been trying to buy all morning. But good news is it‚Äôs a dip so now‚Äôs a good tome to buy and hold!

Let‚Äôs say they have 1,000,000 shares  For every 10,000 shares they sell, they drop the next 10,000 by $10 to the point that the stock is losing money and not being consistent as it was.   EXAMPLE:  GameStop = $1000 with a volume of 10,000,000  They sell 3,000,000 shares starting at $1000 and the next 100,000 shares after the initial the price goes down by $10 leading all the way to a lower price point for said stock.  THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION    CORRECT MY RETARDED MATH IF IM WRONG  THEY ARE JUST GIVING IT ALL TO SCARE US BEFORE THEY LOSE A SHIT TON OF MONEY BY THE END OF TOMORROW   THEIR CONTRACTS EXPIRE TOMORROW, IF GME STAYS ABOVE $200 WE WIN.  DO NOT SELL. HOLD.   I AM RETARDED, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL EXPERT OR ANYTHING. I AM ONE OF YOU. DIAMOND HANDS BROTHERS AND SISTERS

The Power of the Autist Has Been Realized
Fellow Artists, Experienced and green alike,     I would like you congratulate you on raising awareness to the greed and corruption that the suits on Wall Street dangle over us every day retail traders. They are constantly manipulating the markets to suit their agenda and their wallets. They thought that we were a merry band of fools from whom they could syphon money.   We have proven them wrong in the past few weeks. We have shown them that   Million of us can unite strong to prevail over the hedge funds and cause them to lose billions of dollars. Now, soon, we must determine our way forward.   There are   degenerates here, many came clamoring for community and a place to gamble away the pennies earned when sports were taken from us almost a year ago. Most have come in the past few weeks looking to participate in the greatest outcry of the people against financial institutions of all time.  We must now join together to continue to help the little man. Let us go forth having delivered a heavy blow and take our tendies to reinvest them in the small companies that have good and strong fundamentals that have yet to be noticed. That deserve a few shekels to grow. We have taken from the rich and the greedy despite the ironic betrayal by Robinhood, now let us continue to invest in those that truly need it.   Just a thought.   GME/AMC forever.
Hearing slv silver is next
People saying slv or ag is the next play.
They can't pull this bs forever, we only need to hold. I am not selling. I am buying the dip.
Holders¬†of¬†$GME!  And of¬†$BB!  My¬†brothers!  I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.  A day may come¬†when the courage of Men fails, when we sell our shares and break all bonds of fellowship,¬†but it is not this day.  An hour of bears and closed positions, when the age of retards comes crashing down, but it is not this day!  This day we¬†hold!  By all that you hold dear on this good sub, I¬†bid you stand,¬†Men of r/wallstreetbets!
ITS BOUNCING BACK, DONT FUCKING SELL YET, HOLDDDD

That is all
Fundamentals are strong, I believe. I AM BLACKBERRY.
Buy $NOK
Buy $NOK - help out these companies being shorted by big hedge funds. Look at all the manipulation going on as they reveal their power.
Hypocrites
Remember when wall street tanked the global economy and then the SEC regulated them? Me neither. These fuckers cheat the system everyday and  the moment we strike back they call foul!  We will not surrender  We will not sell  GME & AMC to the motherfucking andromeda galaxy!!!!
And now TatstyWorks....
I just received an email stating that TastyWorks is only closing orders of GME, AMC, and KOSS. I am sure others with a TastyWorks account has received the same email.
WE WANT OUR TENDIES!... WHEN DO WE WaNT THEM! ‚õΩ
SERIOUS: Where Can We Buy GME??
Robinhood showed their true colors ("Rob from the poor and give to the rich"), and even my favorite platform Interactive Brokers shut it down.  What platforms are still out there to buy GME??
Fuck Robinhood. I hope it burns to the fucking ground after this. We as people need to fucking stand up against this fucking corrupted ass shit
Do not panic. We are still winning.
The HF‚Äôs are driving the price down to panic people into selling, because that‚Äôs the only option they‚Äôve left us in our brokerages. But fuck citadel and fuck Robinhood, let me put your minds at ease.   1.	Ask yourself how a stock with a 10 day average volume of 100m+ is swinging down 75% from 2 million of volume. It‚Äôs the HF‚Äôs trying to catch your sell order safety nets or panic you into selling since that‚Äôs the only option at your disposal right now.  2.	it‚Äôs far more likely they are playing a game with the shares they have versus all 2m of that volume coming from retail investors. There‚Äôs no way they can cover their short positions and they know it.  3.	the bid ask is 142/1500. Why the fuck are those numbers so far away from each other? I‚Äôm retarded but I know enough to say that‚Äôs not normal.  4.	they are freaking out that the options ITM expiring tomorrow are going to be exercised, further crushing demand. If the stock goes up to 320 then every option is expiring ITM and they are royally fucked.  5.	we knew this would happen. If you get on a rollercoaster and it dives down a dip do you shit your pants and bail? NO. You ride that motherfucker to the end. Stay strong my friends, we are in this together.  6.	as many people have pointed out, we are David and they are Goliath. Losing 100-1000 bucks to us is nothing. Why solidify losses in a panic? Just hold it. Time is on our side. They are paying interest for Borrowing shares.   Be strong.     this bitch to the  .
Market open, market closed, market open, market closed, market open, market closed...
DO NOT FALTER!  DO NOT CAVE!  PROFITS ARE COMING!  FOR ONLY THE BRAVE!  DIAMOND HANDS?  RETARD CLUB!  HOLD THE LINE!  INCOMING DUB!

AMC Thread
38 mil. shorts today compared to 33 mil. yesterday.     This can go to the moon.     Be smart. Or retarded. Idc. Just buy asap when you can.
How do Brits get in on this?
Hey there, I'm living in the UK and would like in on this but we can't use Robinhood. Any help?
We're wittnessing government overreach
This administration would rather see ordinary Americans lose money than see hedge funds lose money. It just goes to show that there are two different clubs and we're not part of the lawless club. I think it's time to have paper hands. We can't beat the politicians and the 1%.
ROBINHOOD
Thinking about dumping all my robinhood stock and buying else were.   Looking for some advise i dont want to support a company that doesnt support and stick up for the small folks.
BUY NOW GME GUYS, ALL THIS NEW SHORTS TO GET SQUEEZED! FUCK THEM
AOC SUPPORTS A HEARING OVER ROBINHOOD‚ÄôS CORRUPT BLOCKING OF STOCK PURCHASES!
REPOST THIS EVERYWHERE SO PEOPLE DONT SELL
KEEP REPOSTING THIS:  WHY THE STOCK PRICES ARE GOING DOWN: ROBINHOOD IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST PLATFORM OF WHICH PEOPLE ARE USING TO BUY VOLATILE STOCKS (PEOPLE JUST STARTED TO INVEST TO MAKE MONEY, AND ROBINHOOD IS THE FRIENDLIEST PLATFORM). ROBINHOOD CURRENTLY BLOCKED THE BUYING OPTION ON THE VOLATILE STOCKS, SUCH AS NAKD, AMC, GME, NOK. SINCE PEOPLE CAN'T BUY BUT CAN ONLY SELL, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE PRICE WILL PLUMMET DOWN. HOWEVER, WHEN ROBINHOOD'S TRADING RESTRICTION GETS LIFTED, THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS WILL GET STONKED, SO PLEASE HOLD UR FUCKING SHIT TOGETHER UNTIL THEY GO UP DONT SELL!
EU GANG ING IS ALLOWING GME PURCHASES BUY BUY BUY
Every morning I wake up dreaming of being debt free
This movement is for the nerds like me who only dream of buying a house for my wife and children, paying off my student loan debt, and setting myself up for retirement. You know, realistic goals for most of the middle class peasants in this world.   Ever since I‚Äôve graduated from college. Ive dreamt of winning the lottery so I could pay off my student loan debt. I get lost in daydreams where I no longer have to pay off my ridiculously expensive education. I‚Äôm in utter bliss when I think of never having to send a payment to fedloan ever again.   Why is it okay for the richest 1% to deprive me many others of these simple dreams?  But then it‚Äôs completely fine for these same hedge fund tards to ruin the economy, crash it, send it into a recession, and rip the dreams out of the hands of so many others?   I hope RH collapses into non existence after this.    I will definitely be vacating the platform once I reap the profits drench in the tears of hedge fund suits.   TO THE FUCKING MOON FOLKS.
THIS IS FINE, THIS IS THEIR STRATEGY! HOLD THE LINE! Losses will be gains.
AOC comments on Robinhood blocking trading
Strap in, boys!
Hmm, what just happened that looks a lot like this after Robinhood bans buying? Short Attack? What do you think?
Blocking the buying of $AMC $GME and $BB is borderline insider trading for Hedge Funds
When a Hedge Fund buys up stocks of a short sell and start a squeeze they'd call it "Smart Trading" but when a bunch of retards do it they get all the retail investors to block trades? Fuck them, Diamond Hands or die.
Eff it! Don't sell! You can't anyway! ü§£
I keep yelling at my computer. "Suspend my shit!! I ain't selling!"  It's principle now!   Keeps getting suspended. Platforms aren't working. Can't see my positions half the time.

Fuck    hands. WE HAVE    BALLS SQUEEZE AND HOLD EM BOYS AND GIRLS.
Speaking of manipulation - the dip we're in right now is from LOW volume. Hmmm so restrict buying GME and drive the price down... who could be behind that??
The dip is simply from everyone selling off from Robinhood to buy with another broker. Buy the dip. Hold the line. They want us to sell and not buy back in.
I am not a financial advisor and everyone should make their own, educated, financial decisions.
Keep buying and hold on to it. The demand is insane and we will get there. To the moon gme.
All the GME drama and shenanigans is unifying Americans and the world more than any slogan or politician ever could. The sleeping giant that is a unified public against a common enemy has been awoken!
I hope real folks on every side of the political spectrum can band together and cause meaningful change!
What happened here to my order? GME filled at
YESTERDAY WAS A BATTLE BUT ROBINHOOD AND THE SUITS HAVE MADE THIS WAR. REPORT THEM TO THE SEC THIS IS REAL MARKET MANIPULATION AND SOMEONE IS ABOUT TO STRING UP A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT YOU CANT JOIN IT IF YOU SEL AND RUN. JOIN US IN THIS FIGHT.

Do you want to panic sell and take a loss that is not yours to take?    Or do you want to tell your kids how you helped crooked money bleed into your diamond hands?    Illegal manipulation doesn't change the facts. I'm not selling.    Also, I'm not a financial advisor. Your move.

New trader: what app should I use instead of Robinhood?
Like many of you, I woke up to some bullshit.   I literally only own two shares of stocks (got into it last week), but this seems like a good time for a discussion.   Anyway, fuck Robinhood. Where should I go?
REVOLUT ACCEPTING BUY REQUESTS
REVOLUT IS ACCEPTING BUY ORDERS!!!
What happened to AAL?
Jumped 24% at open now down to 8% gain on the day? I was excited there for a minute lol
Message sent to Robinhood, please do the same.
Maybe don't buy more
Guys I really don't think buying more stock is a good idea at this point.
Let's make WSB a hedge fund, for the people, by the people. If they won't let the little guy play by their rules, then they can fuck right off, we'll BEAT them at their own game
My smooth brain won't be able to put together a coherent plan, but if we actually could do something like this, then what argument do they have against us? The only way they have power is we have lag in decision making and distribution of information.
We aren‚Äôt the ones selling!! It shows in the trading volume and they can‚Äôt hide that!!
Apex Clearing is why you can‚Äôt trade your memes. This is the same cleaning house used by Robin Hood.
I‚Äôm able to buy GME on Fidelity‚Äôs   grabbed some at 120
WE NEED TO LIST EVERY APP AND SITE BLOCKING TRADES. LAWSUITS. FIRE RIGHT BACK AT THEM
Let's make a comprehensive list of every app and site blocking trades right now. This is so fucked. We will out last them. Let's fire right back at them. Let's figure out who owes us money for our rocket fuel and in-flight tendies!  Merrill Edge   Ameritrade    Robinhood   Who else? Comment the companies you've been blocked by! I'll add em to the list!

DO NOT SELL. HOLD THE LINE. This game is not over yet. Not by a long shot. WE ARE BACK AT $200! This war is just beginning. This will extend into next week. WE NEED TO CONTINUE BUYING MONDAY AT OPEN
Can someone please recommend a brokerage that doesn't cater to gay bears?
Td and Robinhood blocked buying GME. Are other brokers allowing purchases? M1? Webull? Fidelity?
It took me hours to get to fucking buy and thanks to that I got to buy on the dip.
Thank you to the chickens and WS for allowing me to get in the right moment.
GME right now
Fidelity working for GME?
I'm having trouble buying through them.
LETS. GO! WE ARE BREAKING THROUGH SQUEEEEEEZE
ONLY WAY IS UP!       HOLD THE LINE! THE BEST IS YET TO COME!!! THE SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT!
It was wrong to fight in multiple stocks - $GME was going well and all the power must have been concentrated on it
I am not fighting the battle as I was late, but maybe everybody should focus on $GME till they're down and then $NOK/$BB/$NAKD etc. until they fear shorting stocks again.     You guys are more powerful than them, the brokers have betrayed the army, but you can still win!
WSB started this.. WSB will finish this.
People cannot let cable news or internet articles sway you..   they are trying HARD to short.. I mean wouldn't you if billions were at stake?  this is on them.. they won in 2008.. they played the American people and CASHED OUT!  Learn from the decade fight B_T_C holders have gone thru!  HOLD!   "they have merely tasted desperation, ive been poor forever, i was molded by it costs me nothing to hold"   "The¬†enemy of my enemy¬†is¬†my¬†friend is an ancient proverb which suggests that two parties can or should work together against a common¬†enemy."
Went in with 10k. Down to 5k. At this point I‚Äôll take nothing, so no reason to sell, right? HOLD THE LINE.
AOC has our backs!!! Hold these brokers accountable for manipulation!
EVERYONE FILE AN SEC COMPLAINT AGAINS ROBINHOOD OR YOUR BROKER
Everyone should be absolutely furious. This isn‚Äôt a free market anymore. This is a rigged game. But don‚Äôt give in fellow artists. We have the following of millions. With that power, if we all write complaints to the SEC and make a petition, we can change this rigged game to the tendieland that is was always meant to be.
Looking forward to seeing Chamath Palihapitiya back on the news reeming out the brokers and exchanges.
I didn't get in GME, fine watching from the sidelines as people stick it to wall st.  I'm fine watching people profit, and lose in the market place. What's a joke is when you are made to lose, banning buying to "save retail and volatility" is an embarrassment and a pretty shit excuse.  Based on the talks Chamath has had the last few days - very excited to hear his next interview. He understands both that retail has been t  on in the past, and that the GME trade is more than just a trade.
Do you only have robinhood?
Is there no other fucking app in the USA? These fuckers are plotting right now so they don‚Äôt go down
THE COMEBACK
This shit ain‚Äôt gonna fly you fucking retards. Do you see how scared we have them??! WE HAVE MORE POWER THAN WE UNDERSTAND.   This is uncharted territory. The little man has never held this much power over the rich, now is our time to do some damage.   Don‚Äôt bow down to these boot licking shmucks. Buy if you have the ability to. HOLD NO MATTER WHAT. WE WILL NOT LOSE THIS WAR.   everything happening right now is all part of their plan. This is a coordinated attack on retail investors by hedge funds and trading platforms. Now is our time to take what is ours.   Be a pussy if you want to, but if you‚Äôre like me we aren‚Äôt going Fuckin anywhere. I will NOT concede to the suits and their cry baby mentality. Time to get mentally strong retards, lets fucking do this.   This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for us to change the future of the stock market. Don‚Äôt get weak now.
APEX clearing was taken out by Wall Street to prevent you from trading. They went for the head. This should be illegal!!
This isn‚Äôt going away
I just gotta say I‚Äôve been watching a lot of CNBC and Fox Business just to see what they‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs a lot of bullshit and belittling of us but I think they‚Äôre coming around the the message of all of this to be fair. But the one thing I feel like they‚Äôre missing is that this isn‚Äôt ever going away. (Illegal)‚ÄùRegulation‚Äù of ‚Äúretail‚Äù investors and new age platforms or not this isn‚Äôt dying. Even if the push on GME slows or what ever (it won‚Äôt fuck them  ).  This is message to the establishment that has fucked over the little guys for decades. Whether it‚Äôs GME or a new stock this has just proved that the markets are changing and the people can hold these peoples feet to the fire and I‚Äôm ecstatic. They‚Äôre all scared because we‚Äôre just starting to realize the power of the people. Never stop
TastyWorks bans buying $AMC and $GME too, blames their custodian
GUYS DON'T FREAK OUT. Hold and we WIN! Switch Platforms and BUY. Now is the time for MORE!
Take advantage of this dip. The only reason it dipped this far is because platforms are restricting sales. THIS is what they want. We BUY and we WILL reach the moon guys.     SWITCH PLATFORMS, there are a ton of posts already with links to platforms allowing trades. Buy LOW at this dip and we skyrocket TOGETHER.                      Not financial advice, I have IQ somewhere in the negatives.
Buy the Dip... Not that easy!!! Transaction Declined!

Media blaming the loss on us!
By Sagarika Jaisinghani, Medha Singh and Svea Herbst-Bayliss  (Reuters) - A slugfest between Wall Street and Main Street took an unexpected turn late on Wednesday after moderators of a stock trading forum that has helped fuel massive rallies in the shares of GameStop temporarily closed its doors.  Shares of GameStop and other companies tumbled in extended trading after Wallstreetbets, a discussion forum popular with retail traders on the Reddit website, briefly turned invitation-only. They pared those losses around an hour later, when the forum opened back up.
Must asset management inc just sold   shares of GME.
Any way to transfer my funds in Robinhood instantly???
I have 10k in there that was supposed to be in gamestonks right now. How can I get these funds to the right place right now to buy!?
You got this fellas
Good job Reddit
GME BUYERS ABOVE 300 WERE COMING BACK FOR YOU
We buy the dips and hold.
I was not a member until today. I have no idea about stocks. Frankly, I know fuck all besides the fact we called it the free market. But its clear now the free market isn't free. This is regular people wanting a free market vs those who control it behind the scenes
I never paid attention to stocks, and honestly the loss porn was funny to see every now and then but I never took It seriously. What is going on right now is not only clear market manipulation, but a clear message that larger corporations control our daily lives and don't want to lose that. That's the most anti american thing I can think of, and the fact that they are scrambling and are calling those who invest nazis is disgusting. I don't ever remember a moment like this, and the movement is far beyond reddit at this point. Its real freedom and us wanting free trade vs those who have stole it away. I'm fucking proud of you bois, I'm investing today. I'm not a true wallstreetbetter, but I wanna help. Spread the word bois this is crazy
GME
Where can we invest that is not currently restricted?
AOC is on our side
Where to start?
I'd like to start investing, but with all the shade around robbinhood I don't know where to start. How do I even buy a stock?
THIS IS TEMPORARY
Careful guys, they're shaking tons of weak hands but remember we are playing with free money. Dont think about money lost, think about money earned. They didn't do this when TSLA launched over the moon and straight to mars because they were part of the ride. Hold, Double Down if you can. Itll shoot back up and beyond once these Schmucks can get a piece of the pie.   GME BB NOK AMC rockets baby... rockets
BUY THE DIP!!!!!, DONT SELL
WE MOVE ONWARDS MEN! WE WILL NOT BE DEFEATED!
Men, Retards, Autists and lurkers. I stand with you in this GME fight!
Your passion has moved me. I heard of the market manipulation going on by Robinhood and I decided I have to take a stand. It's not much, but I bought 13 shares to fight with you, and if needed, to bleed with you. I will let it go to 0 if I must.   You have a brother here and I'm not going anywhere!
I can't buy, but I can hold. My titties are made of adamantium. My heart is pounding with the fury of war. HOLD THE LINE!
PSA: WeBull lets you transfer your entire portfolio of stocks (and partial too) to their brokerage.
If you go to   you can transfer your entire portfolio from Robinhood, et al, to Webull. It has to be over $500 total value, and you might get charged a fee, but I think totally worth it to move everything AS-IS from Robinshit.
Getting $NAKD here, you all should as well!
Who doesn't like being NAKD?  Like really?   They may have halted others, so jump on this one now until the others come back!
So, why don't we play hard ball
Why don't we leave our positions in GME, AMC, etc. in place (since they've restricted action) and move to the next one. SNDL is 77-cents right now...
If only there was a decentralized asset that couldn‚Äôt be bound to this FUD.....
If this doesn‚Äôt scream to invest in b1tco1n...
What the fuck is going on with Schwab? I‚Äôm getting tired of this bullshit.
All I want to do is buy more GME but these rich fuckers are ruining it.

Anyone else struggling on E-Trade to buy $GME with the constant haulting?
This isn't a pathetic boomer war media makes it out to be
Saying things like 'the redditors seem to hate hedge funds' and 'wanting to reduce boomer money' are stupid misconceptions of what's happening right now. Hedge funds just made a mistake by placing so much money for stock to go down and we saw a chance to make money out of that. That's quite literally what investing is about.
BUY THE DIP OR HOLD!!!!!!!! the comeback will be bigger than setback!!
For everyone posting ‚ÄúAm I too late to get in on GME?‚Äù
We just got a free discount to buy more. The rocket just came back to pick you FOMO weirdos up
GME is going through the floor!!! What's going on?
The share price is dropping by the second. currently sitting at $  per share. Super dip?
WE'RE COMING BACK LETS FUCKING DO THIS FUCK THEM!!!!!!!! HOLDING MY -$$20K!!!!!

THE RALLY IS COMING! BUY BUY BUY
A good broker to move to: Tastyworks. It's like Robinhood but they actually care about you. Low commission and the founder did a livestream this morning talking about the benefits of GME.
I do not have any interest in sharing this, I just wanna see people able to buy GME again. I moved from RH to this months ago POS: 9 @290 avg
Do we short Robinhood's IPO after today's actions?
They fucked all us over. Do we get our revenge by shorting their IPO and ruining them?
bought some more $BB
Now, open the flood gate
It's not even Friday yet. The fact that this is all going down, means we were right. Hold.

Everyone sell... Everyone buy into same thing... Everyone gets money
Past history is telling us to hold. We are at the tomorrow portion now!   HOLD EVERYONE
We are about to see the greatest rise and fall + short attempt of all time
Citadel helped bail out Melvin to tune 1-3 billion, and Citadel owns, thus they back and process RobinHood trades.   So in an effort to help cover their own loss, they had RobinHood restrict retail investors like you and I, so that the hedgies can buy up the stock from everyone selling it in panic...   In a couple days or weeks you‚Äôll see RH brings them back.  Hedgies will silently buy more shorts.   The share prices will rise like we‚Äôve never seen before.   And then hedgies will dump it all for a profit on shares. And then make even more on their shorts.   The reason I say attempt, is because it‚Äôs up to all of us if we allow this or not.   If you want to fight it:  1. Don‚Äôt conduct anymore trades on RobinHood involving affected tickers. DO NOT SELL!!!  2. Move all other ticker business off the RH and various other platforms blocking us.   3. Hold, Hold, Buy Dips, Hold, Hold  4. Wait, because they can‚Äôt afford to fuck this up again and their financial solvency will NOT last as long as we will hold.   They‚Äôll all be out of business by July.
Robinhood
Anyone else notice the irony of an app called Robinhood protecting the rich and screwing the little guy?
RobinHood the app did the exact opposite of what Robin Hood would‚Äôve done.
The real Robin Hood stole from the rich to give to the poor.  RobinHood the app is fucking over the poor to save the manipulative rich.   Damn son.
BRITBONGS CAN ANYONE CONFIRM IF HARGREAVES LANSDOWN ARE STILL LETTING YOU BUY?! T212 AND ETORO ARE KILL. DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER

RobinHood thinks I‚Äôm gonna sell GME just because they removed the buy button?
I‚ÄôM NOT SELLING SHIT. FUCK ROBINHOOD.   I trust all our brothers and sisters on other brokers and in other countries to BUY and HOLD. I trust everyone on robinhood to HOLD.   This isn‚Äôt over. Robinhood just declared war against the people who made Melvin capital lose billions.   HOLD           ü§≤üèº  TL;DR: fuck robinhood, fuck citadel, fuck Melvin. HOLD GME
WHY YOU SHOULD HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS
Here read this  I feel like more people need to see this comment especialy now.  u/Jabarumba  Copied from "Andrea" on Yahoo Finance board:  Look I feel I need to break this down especially for new people. The Float is 34 million shares because Cohen bought 13% with the option to go to 20% however he publicly has not came out probably due to this all out war. Anyway that leaves a tradeable float at 34 million and you have 71 million shares short. Then you NOW have   million CALLS all IN THE MONEY. That's 220 million shares so the market makers and others are net short this stock 291 million - 34 million float for a total of 257 million net short. There is NOT enough shares to go around plain and simple. The float is shorted by about 8X and they are completely stuck. They are doing everything to talk this stock down through media, print, TV internet even these boards are full of these paid shills to get you to sell. It's all a scare tactic. They stopped selling the CALLS today because they finally looked at the numbers and had a epiphany of how bad it really is. Ameritrade stopped trading in it. It's a HUGE game of manipulation and you know what I AM NOT SELLING. These funds that wrote the CALLS and shorted the stock are liquidating a lot of other positions to bring this down. Don't get manipulated by them. These shares are golden and soon you will be able to name your own price.
Schwab halted trading as soon as they saw GME was going up a bit after dropping.
DO NOT SELL KEEP HOLDING
Can someone please give us a resource to see short positions in real time?

Live Short Float Tracker
Anyone have a site they know of that live tracks short float percentage? I use finviz typically to track but they only update daily. Looking for a live tracker if anyone knows of one.

LISTEN UP EVERYONE. PIN THIS POST LET IT GRAB ATTENTION
THIS NEEDS TO BE REPOSTED AND SEEN BY EVERYONE EVERYWHEREüö®  $AMC $NOK: It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).  Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.   They are blatantly manipulating the marketing

Dave Portnoy calls out Robinhood Co-founder
While RobinHood won't allow us to sell AMC GME etc, YOU will not allow me to s itpost positive memes on r/Wallstreetbets; open this sub up!
See title. I made a doomguy meme about Robinhood but guess y'all don't wanna see it     ALSO FUCKING HOLD AMC  Fuck the Inst investments
Think about this!
You can only SELL to someone who wants to BUY. So if the apps are blocking retail investors from buying $GME, who do you think you are giving your prized shares too today?   This is their last effort before our payday, stay strong!

WHAT IF EVERYONE WENT TO THIER LOCAL GAMESTOP AND BOUGHT OUT THE STORE? How would the "fundamentals" change when GameStop see its highest sales in decades?
Wall Street is saying the "fundamentals" aren't there for GameStop. Wouldn't it be something if a wave of nostalgia hit all the former customers of GameStop and they decided to pay a visit to their favorite Gaming store this weekend?  I wonder what Wall Street's excuse would be next...

We are currently here, HOLD before we launch to Mars!!!!!
Is there a real possibility the stocks that everyone is rallying will go back up?
My diamond hands are getting sweaty. I‚Äôll continue to hold but what do you guys think?
THE WORST IS OVER... ITS GOING BACK UP
The best revenge against RH is to cashout and change platform.
It's capitalism 101. Fuck em.
Because no fine could ever compete with Citadels potential loss here, companies found guilty of purposeful market manipulation should have their entire executive team let go with no compensation
This is the only way to combat this absolute bullshit
There were no halts
In case you didn't notice, there were no halts when GME fell from $467 - $120. Plenty of them on the way up though.   I am not selling.
PLEASE READ
Robinhood is committing stock manipulation. They won‚Äôt allow you to buy AMC or GME, yet allow you to sell which will only drive the stock price down. That is stock manipulation, that is illegal.
GME ON OFFER WHEREVER YOU CAN GET IT, THIS IS THEIR LAST ATTEMPT TO CRUSH US AND IT WILL NOT WORK
OUTTA THE GALAXY WE GO
Trying to control the price
Please hold this is not the downfall. They are trying to ease off the chickens and trying to control it . GME is still very valuable.
What do they think is going to happen next?
So what do they think is going to happen when they reopen trading on these platforms?  WSB isn't going anywhere.  As soon as gme and the rest open up again do they really think that it's going to go back to normal?  Nah it's just going to get bought up again and go even higher.  Even you paper handed fucks will reenter at a lower price and everyone else will go to mars while your stuck on the moon.  Also, fuck robinhood. I'm taking what ever I have at the end of this and moving to something else.
How to Transfer Positions out of ROBBINGhood without paying $75 fee?
Currently in order to submit a ACATS transfer my postions to a broker that doesn't engage in market manipulation, it'll cost me $75. While this is a small price to pay for freedom, I don't wanna give those fat cats in black suits another CENT. If anyone knows how to avoid this fee that would be awesome and I would be forever grateful, and I'm sure plenty of others would love to move out as well.  I'm also taking recommendations for which online broker to move to, if there are any honest, free market loving brokers left out there.

Opinion: Air Canada Inc. a safe long-term buy?
Air Canada, as most air travel companies, has been hit hard by Covid restrictions. It has a 52-week high of   and currently opened today at   It is highly unlikely, as one of if not the biggest air travel companies in Canada, to go under. It is in the process of attempting, pending approval, to buy Air Transat which will give it control of most of the Air Travel market in Canada. Once we get through Covid, I expect Air Canada to not only return not its 52-week high but actually surpass it. Also expect a lot of people seeking vacation travel for relief of stress from Covid. Don't expect any good returns for at least a year or so.
Webull has shut down GME positions
HOLD THE LINE
reposting another's wise words! GUYS Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.     It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.     DFV could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.     These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.     Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.     Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.     This is a repost!!!!!!
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING - HOLD YOUR LINE. THE TRADING VOLUME IS TOO LOW TO BE PEOPLE SELLING OFF. THESE MARKET MANIPULATOR FUCKERS ARE TRADING SMALL VOLUMES BETWEEN EACHOTHER. DON'T FALL FOR THEIR DECEPTIVE LIES. HOLD. HOLD. HOLD!!!!!!
How can we fuck Robinhood as hard as possible? We want REVENGE!!
Fuck you Robinhood!! FUCK YOU and your  . FUCK all of you.  With that, what can we do to fuck Robinhood with a very large cock? Removing funds and closing accounts is obvious, but it is not enough. The class action lawsuit will go nowhere beyond a slap on the wrist, if that. Their IPO may never happen. Ideas?  Maybe u/ElonMuskOfficial can help with hurting Robinhood's PR for helping the shorts, and in return we buy $TSLA to the sky?  Also, don't forget: FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD!
My mom lost her house in the housing market crash, so fuck you Wall Street. GME  üåï
I was in my early teens when this happened: my mom was forced to sell our house she had worked  for years to afford because a bunch of Wall Street assholes got too greedy. She ended up having to sell it for so little she couldn't afford a new place and had to rent. Then the town she was in got gentrified to the tits, she couldn't afford rent and she got evicted. So, when I saw that you beautiful fuckers here on r/wallstreetbets were giving those pricks the finger my first thought was: BUY. And that's exactly what I did. And I just did it again with this fucking sale that just happened.  FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD. FUCK YOU WALL ST. FUCK YOU MELVIN. FUCK YOU CITRON. GME TO FUCKING ANDROMEDA.
Just bought the dip.. now hold!!!
GME just shot back up to 190+
Hold the line you beautiful buttholes.    This is what people were trying to tell you.  Don't sell into dips, buy them!
THERE'S A CRIME IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW - somebody grab some screenshots quick, I'm not in a position to!
Right now on Yahoo finance gme is being listed as "trading halted" (by NASDAQ) however if you go back and refresh, there is clearly movement?!     THAT MEANS THE BIG BOYS ARE ALLOWED TO TRADE IN THIS THING INCLUDING BUYING PER CURRENT TRENDS WHILE IT'S DIRT CHEAP KNOWING THAT ONCE OUR SIDE IS BACK ONLINE WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT IT TO THE MOON AGAIN!  That means this isn't just manipulation anymore, it's fucking robbery.  We're being publicly fleeced by criminal action in public and they think nobody's going to do jack shit about it.  Grab screenshots, now.
Ask price for gme 1,500. Help a newbie out!
I've out in an order to buy at 165 or lower but it doesn't fill and suggests that to buy, I must spend 1,500 per share. Can anyone help me understand?

Was buying the dip then poof, no more. "We are not currently accepting opening orders for this security. Closing orders for existing positions may be placed online."
What other trading app besides RobinHood can I still buy Nok, Gme, BB, GMC?
This is massive market manipulation. They gave no fair warning to restricting trading for retail traders and are completely against a free and democratic market. Where do I sign up for a class action suit? These hypocrites owe us money. I'm disgusted by these suits obeying their hedge fund overlords and not allowing a free market. I'm removing my money from RobinHood. We should all remove our money from these apps and only use apps that allow a free market. We are the people!
I'm all for crushing Hedge funds, but the end game is also probably going to hurt a lot of smaller traders.

It's all down! Keep up the good fight!
Charles Schwab  Stash Banking  Robin Hood  The list goes on....     Coming from a tech background, this appears to be a very concentrated and coordinated attack. There's an incredibly small chance of peak traffic actually taking down every single trading platform at the same time, as they claim it's doing currently. These multi-billion $$ (and global) companies have plenty of resources to sustain high-volume traffic. But hell, if you don't make a few enemies along the way, you're probably not doing it right!      To all my apetards out there fighting - it might not be an easy fight, but it's a fight worth fighting. Show them who holds the real power, don't give in to the scare tactics, and for the love of all future generations, hold the fuck on!

I need to join but it seems impossible to find anywhere I can buy GME
Citadel processes 50%-75% of RHs trades. Citadel is RHs main source of profit. Citadel back Melvin with $2b just 3 days ago.
The people who are backing the shorts in $GME are the same people who process the trades and are the same people who are restricting people from buying, but allowing them to sell, all while the institutions that are short $GME can buy the stock you are only allowed to sell.                  Market manipulation has never been so clear. This has to have major consequences for these companies and the people running them.

HOLD FAST, BROTHERS
HOW TO GET YOUR SHARES OUT OF ROBINHOOD
Fastest way, if you have another brokerage account at fidelity, Etrade, vanguard, etc.. You can simultaneously sell your robinhood and buy shares from the other account without impacting the share price.  It will be a net zero.   Otherwise open an account at another brokerage, and do the same thing.   Lastly, you can request all shares be transferred to another the brokerage.  This can take up to weeks.  Seems Robinhood will be holding the line here.  The 'loss' you take under Robinhood will be used as evidence in a class action lawsuit later. that will take time. but to buy and trade and kill these institutional investors, you need to hold the line. THEY ARE WINNING  Fuck Robinhood. Fuck these guys. They're going to get a slap on the wrist for all this in the end.

When robinhood IPOS im going all in shorting that piece of shit. How can this be remotely legal?
How can they do this with no reprocussion? They are fucking over hard working people just cause they are finally beating wall street?   Robinhood should be shutdown and should be forced to pay all users a settlement.   I dont short but I will short robinhood when it ipos
I AM STILL HOLDING!! If I can, so can you
NOW. it‚Äôs a game-Start  READ  lawsuits
Alright Robinhood you fucked around.  Now you get to find out.  Already spoke to a lawyer - if you are experiencing massive losses I would recommend you do the same. Contact a lawyer about an INDIVIDUAL case - not a class action. Why?  Well - a little lesson I learned recently thanks to me currently suing 3M. Each of us has ‚Äúindividual damages‚Äù (your personal losses)  You can file an INDIVIDUAL CLAIM for your losses - and that hurts them a LOT more because there‚Äôs no ‚Äúsettlement and once this is paid if the moneys gone oh well.‚Äù YOU GET WHATS YOURS.   So, call a lawyer. I just spoke to mine and we will be filing.
WE LIKE THE STOCK.

If today is not evidence of manipulation against retail investors and the working class, I honestly don't know what is.  The SEC, FINRA, the elected officials all need to look into the collusion to manipulate financial stock prices. If they are found to be guilty, they need to be made an example of. A slap on the wrist will not be enough. Enough already!  THERE NEED TO BE SUBSTANTIAL FINES AND PRISON TERMS. We cannot stand by and watch as our economy gets pillaged by Wall Street only to be bailed out when they start losing.  While we, the common people, suffer for their blatant disregard for our economic situations endured because of their mistakes. On top of this, the bailouts they receive come directly from our tax dollars, so we get fucked twice without even getting wined and dined.  ENOUGH ALREADY.
TASTYWORKS JOINS ROBINHOOD - SETS $AMC $GME $KOSS TO CLOSE POSITIONS ONLY!!!

ROBINHOOD BOYCOTT
Someone needs to start something against Robinhood on all social media sites. Idk what or how, but this criminal action they committed today cannot be allowed to be forgotten and ignored. We are in the middle of a war here between the elites and the layman. If we choose to let this go, we have accomplished   NOTHING  .

We need to crowd-fund a lawsuit against Robinhood
They are causing retail investors to lose money because they decided to pick winners and losers on particular stocks and are essentially engaging in market manipulation (not even hidden) in order to combat fair market trading activity of retail investors.
Longtime Lurker and chronic   - Joining the GME fight because f ck hedge funds!
I've made a few grand in the past from buying   1 day puts on $tsla when the   crashes, but now I've seen the error of my    ways. I bought 2 shares of GME dip today with no intention of making profit, but as a donation to stick it to those hedge fund assholes. Keep fighting the good fight.
TD Ameritrade is calling out Robinhood
The next big move. Shorting Robinhood
After seeing what the big suits did to try and hurt the little guy, should we not continue to harness this energy to hurt the suits anywhere we can? If we can spread the news of Robinhood forcing a short of a stock (which is anti freedom and anti free market) combined with shorts, we should be able to hit them where it hurts. Thoughts?

This is more than just profits
Hi everyone  I'm pretty new around here. For the past year, I've been enjoying getting some profits off of day trading, doing my due deligence and investing in the right opportunities. In thr process I've done nicely for myself, which motivated me to keep an eye on what's going on.   For some time, I've known about this reddit group and what they are trying to achieve. I will admit, I didn't think much of it but seeing what has happened the past week has left me stunned. Y'all have challenged wallstreet in a way I have never seen before! It's honestly awesome, wholesome, and stunning to see those hedgefund scumbags getting a piece of their own medicine.   Right now I invested in BB and NOK. I don't gaf what happens to my account. This is more than just profits now. I'm holding till the end because this movement has proven way more effective at hitting the dragon's head than anything I've seen in my life. Guys and gals, if you keep this up, you will have hit them where it hurts the most! I've read so much of your stories, and for me who's not American, I can relate with you. I know how the wealthy can influence their power against the poor. The wealthy wage wars against the weak. I know it's not the average american making decisions to bomb oil rich countries. Its the average american eho dies for the few who profit off these wars, just like on our side who die for the rich and wealthy.   This cause has crossed borders across the atlantic. Let me tell you now, I am not fucking leaving! I'm gonna hold till the motherfucking end!   WE MUST HOLD and keep those lowlifes PANICKING! Love y'all
HOOOOLD. This is what hedge funds do.. they are trading between themselves to tank the price and scare people, only so they can buy it cheap. HOLD!!
I'm so pissed I wanna cry
I can't buy on the dip! Webull has a stupid 1-2 day hold. Robinhood is being a bastard.  I wanna buy. So bad. I NEED to buy!!!  Are there any apps that are work instantly?
Can we get a list of brokerages still trading GME please?!
Can we get a list of Brokerages that are still trading GME so I can buy this good ass DIP?!
COPY AND PASTE THIS IN A MESSAGE TO ROBINHOOD
Good morning, I understand that you restricted GME transactions today to position-closing only because it was volatile in it's price increase, so I trust that in response to its volatile price drop you will allow it to be purchased again shortly. I received a notification about this restriction so I wanted to confirm that I will receive a notification when this restriction is lifted. Thank you for helping to democratize finance for all, [Your name]
If you AREN'T buying at this exact minute, you are losing on potential hundreds, thousands, and MILLIONS. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DIP AND HOLD
The Hedge funds spent literally an hour re-shortening and trading between each other to kill the price... and now its on the rise!

Just wanted to step away for a minute and say thanks for the ride guys. Regardless of what happens,the ride has been fun. We have shown that regardless of all the manipulation and despite a world wide pandemic we are still strong and fighting for each other.  The sense of Camaraderie expressed across not only this forum but the world is astounding.  To those who took the gains I can‚Äôt blame you at all, this has been life changing gains for many of us.  For my     brothers, hold strong I‚Äôm with you.  Disclaimer: I hold GME and not an advisor and this shouldn‚Äôt be taken as advice.  Just a simple thank you to all the knowledge and friends I have gained through this.
GME, SNDL, BB, AMC, EXPR, NOK, AAL, and NAKD all can‚Äôt be purchased on robinhood. This is absolute crap.

Down with Robinhood, they can't suppress us!
So I'm -6,000 on Gamestop but luckily I have other investments that are doing well. I'm not even mad because this is a movement taking power away from that 1% and placing it into the hands of everyday retards like us. To hell with Robinhood who was supposed to DEMOCRATIZE trading.   Don't they understand that you can kill GME but we will just move on to another stock!   For now, I am holding GME but I think the momentum is done and now on to another stock
How are some brokerages allowed to execute sell orders only and not buy orders? Does that not give enough of a reason to show that it‚Äôs manipulating the market, whether that is on their own or as we assume, due to external influence from hedge funds?
GME Theory - Is this the dip before it blows?
Whether retail trading is halted or not, there are 20mill shares that will need to be purchased tomorrow when calls expire ITM..    Could today just be a precursor to the squeeze finally squeezing tomorrow?  Could they know this, and just be pulling strings to ensure that they are the only ones able to purchase shares on the rocket up tomorrow, maximizing their hedge against they losses?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Would love some input.  Either way
Just Came Back From The Future
... And it was glorious.  There was a GameStop on every corner.  $GME stock price took over as the most expensive publicly traded stock at a number that doesn't even fit this screen.  That's why I got even more $GME earlier today and keep piling on (granted small positions but I'm also a small fry). I don't give two shits how low this goes -  hopefully this will give pause to the cronies on Wall Street that their time for running things is coming to a close. They can rig this shit all they want - we'll be coming.  Also a big FU to Robinhood and all the other brokerage firms that have restricted what's supposed to be a free market. Let's not forget them for when they decide to IPO and show them what a squeeze feels like.  This isn't advice for others out there nor am I suggesting anyone who reads this should bag hold like me. You need to do what's best for you. I just love this community and decided to stop being a lurker.
All I have to say is... buy the dip
Big dick idea - can the USA government just invest in AMC and GME now and wipe out our national debt?
Genius.
What time of day Fri the 29th do the GME shorts have to be reimbursed by buying stocks?
At what point in time are the stocks owed back for all of the shorts that close. I am a novice and only know they are closed on Fridays but is there a specific time? Opening or closing of NYSE or is it any time as long as its on the date?
HOLD THE LINE. THE SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT.
If you sold on the way down, NOW IS YOUR CHANCE. This is blatant manipulation. We are about to launch.  Thrusters are heating up. The space ships are primed. The seatbelts are on.  HOLD THE LINE AND PREPARE FOR LAUNCH.   GME to the stratosphere
Chase Banking not allowing the purchase of GME stock
Fucked in the ass on my birthday.
Yesterday, I posted about how I had an early birthday gift with the short squeeze. This would have continued today if it were not for the blatant market manipulation by multiple brokers that so-called ‚Äúsupport the American dream for the little man‚Äù.  While of course I‚Äôm salty about my large losses on a day like this, I‚Äôm more angry that it‚Äôs because of the injustice caused by the Wall Street insiders more than anything else. Unfortunately, I‚Äôll also remember my birthday as a day that will live in infamy for WSB. As a Schwab trader, of course I‚Äôm glad I can still by shares, but without the others, the cause becomes futile.  As a former Robinhood trader, make the jump to Schwab. Make sure Robinhood loses as much business as possible. Their lack of availability during the crash last March and the extreme bull runs we had last year were the last straw for me. Let this be the last straw for you.  Make the move and continue pumping the fuck out of GME, BB, and AMC.  -Birthtard
They already are manipulating the market!
Since the market opened, all the hedge funds are on + . C'mon people, we can't let them win. Don't even dare to stop buying! Fuck RobinHood, there are a lot of other e-trade apps! BUY BUY BUY! We cannot possibly let them win

LOSTEN UP PEOPLE
THIS NEEDS TO BE REPOSTED AND SEEN BY EVERYONE EVERYWHEREüö®  $AMC $NOK: It‚Äôs unlikely anyone here is selling. This is a short ladder. It only looks like the stock is selling off, ini reality, it‚Äôs not. Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off).  Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.   They are blatantly manipulating the marketing

Think "pent up demand" - Think downward manipulation.  Every dirty trick in the book has been used today. Why, well technical reasons is because the shorts are going to have to be covered.  But morally, they're scared. Why bother artificially reducing demand in GME BB AMC NOK etc. if there was nothing to lose.  Keep on keeping on - we're just getting started.

GME, AMC, BB ‚Äî trading on WeBull rn
Heads up!
BB has had over 125m volume today. That‚Äôs almost as much as it was traded all week. They‚Äôre scared.
AMC also has had over 300m volume today, which is over its 10 day average. All of their  moves are to keep the price artificially low.

The great recession fucked my family life up and required one of my parents to move across the country for their job - during the most pivotal times in a young man's life (ages 12-14).

Robinhood and other trading platforms are blatantly manipulating the market. Only allowing traders to close out positions floods the markets with sell orders, artificially driving the price down. If you look at the spread, these Wall Street suits are selling to each other. This is a last ditch effort to force us out, but we won't give in. When Robinhood decides they want to be on the right side of history and we expand our positions with GME at a flash sale price, we're going straight to the moon.      Godspeed brothers.

Just a reminder: don't put any money into the market you can't afford to lose. It's not worth missing your rent to stick it to Wall Street.
Fuck Robinhood fuck Schwab fuck Ally and fuck Ameritrade for doing this shit to the little guys like us. I'm not saying it's right that you have to take out money, but look out for yourself first and foremost here. For those of you still holding: fight the good fight for us poorer people that had to take out their money today.

THE BANKSTERS LOCKED THE DOOR TO THE CANDY SHOP
At writing we are sitting at 126 with a bid of 48 and an ask of 2000... finished writing at 196 to 5000 spread.  I‚Äôm fucking livid. These bullies locked the door keeping people out and like some shoddy gangster are wanting their payment for your own ‚Äúprotection.‚Äù  We all knew the big money fat cats control everything. That doesn‚Äôt mean we have to sit by while they spit in our faces. I know I‚Äôm not alone in my rage. At least when I drop my dignity to get fucked I get a damned high five of acknowledgment.  SEC complaints and contacting   sure, but we know whose pocket they‚Äôre in before we fizzle down that road.   I sincerely hope we can stick it to those fucks. They‚Äôre showing their massive toolkit and backings while we can only just hold and not even buy.  800 at mixed levels   +ü¶ß=üí™

Against the brokerages
I see everyone downplaying the brokerages but why not go after who is actually pulling the strings? Which is the market makers. The brokerages aren‚Äôt necessarily even doing anything wrong. They are being forced to do this. The market makers, who bailed out Melvin, are telling the brokers they just won‚Äôt process any buy orders for GameStop from them. And there‚Äôs nothing the brokerages can do about it.
GME IS REBOUNDING TO THE MOON!
To the grave with Webull!! Fidelity only ones left?
here comes the rocket!!! hope you're still holding
woosh
GO FOR A WALK, BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT. STAY CALM!   MOON IS THE MISSION   AMC & GME
It‚Äôs not over
Keep adapting!!
As a former employee at one of the type of firms you are targeting, keep exposing them. They are not investors and are not providing capital to help good businesses grow, innovate and create jobs. Govt and the Wall Street establishment will continue to try to thwart you and put up roadblocks. Keep adapting. Utilize the products they have created to bring in new business to your advantage. Adapt to the circumstances.
I just want to give a big s/o to each of you!
These past two days have been nothing short of amazing. You guys keeping doing good things & get paid!  I‚Äôll be watching from afar, maybe even start interacting more with you fine people!
FUCK YOU WALL STREET, LOVE THE UNITY. TOGETHER WE HOLD TOGETHER WE STAND .
CANT STOP, WONT STOP, GAMESTOP  Fuck Melvin Capital and Everyone else on Wall Street. Hold bothers, together we will fuck them more than the IRS will fuck these GAINS . Fuck y‚Äôall , WE LIKE THE STOCK .
DO NOT FUCKING SELL WE GOING BACK UP FOR A REASON
ROBINHOOD IS SCARED SHITLESS RIGHT NOW  LAWSUITS COMING AND THEY CAN'T STOP THAT UNLESS THEY STOP THE MANIPULATION.  FUCK THE BILLIONAIRES WE FUCKING HOLD. LET THE MARKET SPEAK FOR ITSELF.
WE ARE RISING UP FROM THE DEAD, FATHER I WILL SEE YOU ON THE MOON ONCE AGAIN
Still worth to buy NOK?
AMC
Buy AMC Via CashApp   Don‚Äôt let their scare tactics work! Other trading apps/sites still have it available. Stick to the plan! Once others see their buy ins didn‚Äôt go through they‚Äôll find other avenues
Is $500 the magic number?
I was thinking once it hits $500 it‚Äôs the moon for sure and wouldn‚Äôt you know it. Market crashed hard at $480. Hold tight. We‚Äôre on the way back.
RobinHood's liquidity is currently tied up
If it is true that over half of the app's users held some GME - then that is a ton of tied-up liquidity, making it prime for more pumps of other tickers. One domino falls....
Now how the hell am I (are we) going to make our money back?
I'm sure many of us are hurting financially rn, what's our next step as a whole? Obviously WE ARE STILL HOLDING, but what next?
GME BACK UP GO
WE ARE RIDING THE ROCKETSHIP, BABY !!!

This is it everyone  You survived the dip  You held them back  NOW ITS TIME TO GO TO FUCKING PLUTO

WEBULL HAS BLOCKED $GME AS WELL. NOW SELL-ONLY.
Webull is pulling a RH. Can't buy shares of GME, can only sell.
Posted with a screenshot but can't figure out how to attach it as a reddit image instead of imgur.  You can't buy GME on webull. You can only sell.
What the fuck Schwab (tried placing order right before it dipped > $147)
WEBULL IS NOW RESTRICTING GME BUYS AS WELL!
This Short Ladder that just happened is TEXTBOOK
So they first get any short shares they can and then they buy and sell back and forth to each other in low volume while trading is restricted and they're hoping to trigger stop loss orders people have in place along the way to pick up their shares.  Then they either buy the stock and let it regain it's momentum or they then step away and wait for shares to be sold from panicked people.   Can't stop won't stop

Text "SIGN PQSUSU" to 50409 to send a letter to your representatives regarding today's Robinhood fuckery
Text of the letter is pasted below and credited to /u/Bit-Training.  50409 is the number for  . I'm not in any way affiliated with it but have used it before to reach out to my representatives with great success.  "This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.  We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation."

What RobinHood Did Today Is Unjust, It's Wrong, And Possibly More   Contact Your Congressman [LINK]
If you are like me, you have worked hard and saved some money to try to grow it.  You have spent countless hours reading DD, learning about stocks and trades, and planning your best moves.  You did that only to get screwed today out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even more.    Now it is one thing to take a position that doesn't work out.  I certainly have.  We take our wins with our losses.  But this was not that.  This was the powerful flipping the board when they started losing the game.  They literally picked winners and losers.  The message today from RobinHood is "even when you win, you lose".  Or at best, "you can win until we decide you lose" - all within their arbitrary discretion.  This is wrong.  It is unjust.  It is potentially illegal.    CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN  Use this link to find your representatives.  Call them.  Write them.  BE POLITE.  Politely explain that today the rich and powerful brazenly stole from the working man, ironically using a platform called "RobinHood".
HF managers right now thanks to all you beautiful bastards...
STAY OF YOUR PHONE - take a shit - go out - smell a flower - smell a dog‚Äôs head - watch a movie - do a massage to your wife‚Äôs boyfriend.. but hold, hold it

Sorry I'm retarded.

Any apps to instantly upload bank funds? Got screwed by robinhood and trying to buy now not wait 3 days...
Any suggestions? Cash app didn‚Äôt let my amc or nok go through..
Aight listen up people. Don‚Äôt panic sell and I‚Äôll explain why. GME
Yes the price dropped significantly. If you missed the crazy rally and regretted not joining, this is your chance.  For those of us holding, DO NOT PANIC SELL. What‚Äôs happening right now is that the hedge funds are doubling down on their shorts and to drive the price down and make the paper handed bitches sell and cause a cascading effect. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE US PANIC BY SHORTING EVEN MORE. Do you guys understand what this means? That means they potential launch for this short squeeze JUST GOT BIGGER. THIS IS GOING TO 1K AT THE VERY LEAST. As long as we hold AND DONT SELL, we will be in Mars in no time.   Do not be a literal dumbass and fall for their market manipulation ploys. If you consider yourself somewhat smart, dot the dots together and REALIZE THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION BY THE HEDGE FUNDS.  ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS HOLD AND RELAX.   Be logical. Be reasonable. Do not be emotional. Understand the mechanism and strategy of short selling and you‚Äôll know that this dip was a tactic to scare us.   We will not be underestimated. Hold you pussies, hold.
I WANT TO BUY THE DIP SO FUCKING BAD! ROBINHOOD CAN BURN IN HELL

Yep. Market makers exist. Unfortunately today shows us we can't be that if they don't want us to be.
BUT KEEP PUSHING. TODAY SHOWS WE CAN LOSE, BUT ANOTHER SHOWS WE WIN
Report Robinhood to the SEC - Contact office of the SEC Chairman
I strongly urge you to report Robinhood to the SEC for Market Manipulation.  Be respectful - be factual.  You can report fraud to the SEC at  .  You can find the SEC Board members contact information here:    I have done both. I urge you to do the same. I believe by removing the ability for 13 million plus retail investors from participating in a free and fair market is market manipulation at its worst.  Not only is this blatantly manipulative and unethical, it is criminal.

My big lesson from all this is that I‚Äôm shorting the shit out of Robinhood at IPO
Fuck you, Robinhood!   Trust the process tards and hold for mega tendies. These are the final death throes of the fucking Melvins...

We are pulling through
Hey guys.   I know these last days have been a wild ride for so many of us. We could just start dreaming, and be set loose from our shackles.   What ensued was the many stories of people who could support their loved ones, and planning to move towards philanthropy, now that our situation not only resolved about keeping our own heads above water in the rat race.   We are held down by financial riot police at the moment. Teargassing, firing rubber bullets and trying out their scare tactics. Our movement is something that was never supposed to happen, and never would, because our division is upheld by our social stratifications and classes.   What I'm trying to say you retards is APE STRONG TOGETHER.   Help is pumping in from around the world, as people are mad as hell, and are not gonna take it anymore. You will be rewarded in due time, HOLD THE LINE young padawans.
BUY ALL THE AMC THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT WAS FALLING BY RELEASING A BUNCH OF STOCK DON'T FALL FOR THE LIES
"We are all investors. Our time is now." Unless you start making money, then we'll bend you over and teach you a lesson.   This tweet aged like milk. Fuck Robinhood
SPREAD THE WORD - You DO NOT have to sell to change brokers!!!!!!!!!!!!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD  Everyone, spread the word, you do not have to sell or close out positions to change brokerages. If you open an account with a new broker, you simply request them to transfer your holdings.    It takes a while, but while it's being processed you can still 1) buy more with your new broker, if you wish; 2) consolidate positions when the xfer is complete.  It doesn't prevent you from buying or selling with your old broker, either.  If you want to stick it to RH, DO NOT SELL, keep calm and move your shit to a new broker.    Remember, these are YOUR STOCKS, they do not belong to Robinhood!  Please
Three Words.
Fuck. Them. Up.
WE CAN SEND LETTERS TO OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATORS TO ADDRESS THIS MANIPULATION!
If we all send letters to our representatives  and senators' offices, then they won't be able to ignore this! They actually do read emails and respond to them! I've done this before!   Find your representative and senator then you can email them right from their website!   Find your House Representatives here:     Find your Senator's here:     While we're at it, here is Speaker Pelosi's contact as well, IT'S SO SIMPLE SO USE THOSE    of yours and SEND HER A LETTER!        FUCK THE HEDGE FUNDS, FUCK WHOEVER IS INVOLVED IN MANIPULATING THE MARKET AND FORCE US TO GIVE IN!!!! GME TO THE FUCKING SUN MOTHERFUCKER!
Buy $AMC
It‚Äôs cheaper than $GME and they‚Äôre trying to bring it back down during outside hours to discourage us.
GME STILL SHORTED. WSB IS NOT SELLING.
GME WILL rise do not sell!!!! You sell you lose and those greedy fuck boomers win!!! This is the year of the common investor and we will show them we are a force to be fucking reckoned with.  GME - 76 @ $116

Looks like AMC is at a low peak! Buy now and HOLD. LETS FUCK THE HEDGEFUNDS SOME MORE
Go to war, and take no prisoners. WSB.
I'm new to the sub, as are many others I'm sure, given the recent news.  Just popping in to tell you all, you must absolutely go to war of what is happening to GME stock buy prohibitions by trading platforms.  Make a class-action lawsuit against all parties involved, bankrupt them in court for their unwillingness to let the free market be free.  Please, please. I implore you.  Get lawyers involved and bring the cronies to their knees.
ASK NOT WHAT WSB CAN DO FOR YOU, BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR WSB
They want to manipulate our tendies? They think they‚Äôve won the war? Robinhood thinks they‚Äôre an immune third party like Switzerland.   Well Robinhood is the App Store, everyone must leave them a very kind and thoughtful review of what they think of the current situation.  During the Battle of Britain, when all was thought lost, did the British just give up? Did the RAF decide to just stop flying? No gentleman! The battle marches on and one day we will storm the beaches of tendie town and take back what is ours!   Nuke Robinhood off the Apple store!!
GME available on SoFi
I checked my old Sofi account since Robinhood was screwing me and GME is available to buy there. The apps a little slow but it's an option.
We Were Attacked
Millions of dollars suddenly lost due to a coordinated act of evil perpetrated by the big sharks and our trading apps. Since the attack, I‚Äôve been in constant lookout for people such as myself who‚Äôve made tremendous losses, trying my best to encourage as many of you as possible to hold and not let despair destroy your life.   Mental health is IMPORTANT   and perhaps   NOW   more than ever, we have to stay united against this    common    enemy. And with each others‚Äô support and respect, we will prevail.  It‚Äôs not easy. I know. There are expectations. There are life savings. We are going through a global pandemic and every penny counts. GME blessed some of us more than others, but when it comes down to it.. this isn‚Äôt about money. Not anymore. This is about   JUSTICE  . This will go down as one of the most important moments in financial history. And while that may put a lot of pressure on our shoulders, we have to keep going.   We‚Äôre finally reclaiming control over our lives and pushing the market towards the direction it‚Äôs always meant to be in.   FREEDOM  . A truly free and independent market. Even if we don‚Äôt succeed with 1000% gains, we‚Äôll have made a difference. We are not alone in this. Big names support us as well. The seeds for change have been set, we just need a little patience and toughness to see these seeds grow.  My friends. Please, don‚Äôt despair. Be strong and know that I‚Äôm thinking of all of you, because I understand what it‚Äôs like to lose and I understand that it‚Äôs hard to remain positive even though I have full confidence that if all stay faithful to the cause, we‚Äôll see a drastic increase by tomorrow. Hold on a little longer.   Buy, if you can.  But most importantly. Take care of yourself and remember that you‚Äôre not alone. We‚Äôll get through this as we have on several occasions already.     TOGETHER       UNITED       STRONG       free
PSA: Robinhood isn‚Äôt your only option.   still allows purchasing of GME in the US.

No charge to use my simple template -  Dear Representative/Senator Shithead:  How can the SEC allow an app that ironically (or misleadingly) named itself Robinhood elect to manipulate the "stock market" by disallowing buyers in select "volatile" stocks? This seems like prima facie market manipulation to steal from the poor and give to Wall Street.
Don't worry Citadel, we're willing to sell to you
Hold your fucking bags because this is their final try to get out alive
Okay, here goes.  The fucking whores at Melvin and Citadel called up their broker buddies at Robinhood and others and asked them to specifically suspend the buying of GME shares  WHY?  Well, these same greedy pigs sold options for as OTM as 115 then.( they thought GME price would never hit 3 digits.)  Now every single option expiring Friday is in the money. This means they would loose more money on Friday if the price doesn‚Äôt fall back. The fuckers want to scare people thinking they will be bagholders so that people start selling their GME shares and these swoop in and either cover it or short more to push the price down   #HOLD YOUR FUCKING BAGS LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. This is an open war now
PLTR
Big sale today. Hold the line.
Where to buy now?
Can't buy GME on RH, but buying the hell out of the dip. Where do I go?
AOC will ensure there is swift justice
We ain‚Äôt goin nowhere üòé ü§≤

I have been lurking on this sub for years, mostly for a laugh, and for the schadenfreude. If you had told me this sub would make international headlines, I would not have believed it.  Today you guys are moving the needle. You are making powerful entrenched interests, whom have have had the landscape tilted in their direction so long they don't know what level is anymore, squirm. Good work.
Years of value investing until this very moment. I had to do my part. GME to the moon, fuck RobinHood

Aaaand Public joins Robinhood in the grave.
This is only the beginning
Hello everyone. Mods if this post needs changing in anyway please DM me. This is going to be a long and emotional post.  First off I‚Äôd like to thank each and every one of you retards. You can‚Äôt stop an idea.  A message has been sent. To me this isn‚Äôt about money  ‚Äôm up on this actually but that doesn‚Äôt even matter. What matters is that these high up decision makers have got rich off 2 different events in our lives and faced no consequences. I‚Äôm sure everyone in here knows at least one person who has been negatively affected by everything that‚Äôs happened in this pandemic, and it truly makes me sick to my stomach that we had record setting lines at food banks, over a million people dead, millions out of jobs etc.   The fact that we were able to put a dent where they‚Äôre running scared calling up brokerages behind the scenes telling them to buy trades on stocks just so they can get all their money back and fuck everyone else over is wrong.  I work in the Military  and it literally makes me embarrassed and ashamed that these people can commit fraud right out in the open to the point where they think there will be no consequences. I‚Äôm sick to my stomach over the events I‚Äôve seen transpired to the lengths that these little weseals will go to fuck us over.  This is only the start. We need to keep the carnage against them and their worthless tenders going by moving to areas of decentralization where they can‚Äôt silence is from platforms, where they can‚Äôt stop is from making trades. It‚Äôs only January, let‚Äôs keep this energy up all 2021. the carnage doesn‚Äôt stop. AUTISTS WE WILL PREVAIL

Other ways to buy GME?
I'm one of the assholes who tried buying GME last night and had their shares cancelled by RH. The nice thing about RH was the instant transfer so you could buy right away. Are there any other options out there for buying GME where you don't have to wait several business days for your funds to be available to purchase GME? If not, I'm just happy watching you guys take this shit all the way to the moon.
CHARGE!!!! We're back up!
Fuck what they did to you robinhood users. Fuck robinhood, YOLO‚Äôd my savings ,lets fucking draw the line to these cunts.
Their Gameplan : Restrict Buying, Recursive Short-selling
Naked short-selling \ IS\  illegal.  However, recursive short-selling is not.     Shortseller A buys a few shares, then promptly short-sells them.  Shortseller B buys these shares, and then promptly short-sells them.  Shortseller A buys more shares at the lower price, and then short-sells them.  Shortseller B buys these shares at a lower price, and then shortsells them.  (This is likely what caused the 140% float of GME.)     Repeat and repeat.     In a functioning market with long sentiment, this wouldn't work, because your shares would just be bought and held and your ladder would collapse.  However, if you restricted everyone but MMs from buying, but everyone was still allowed to sell...
Girlfriend and I both jumping on AMC. Don't know anything about trading, just like movies.
If your thinking about it like I was, stop, take a breath. It‚Äôs okay. Hold. You WILL thank your diamond hands later
Relax. We‚Äôre in this together.
The fact that we got this far is already extraordinary. All the bitch moves they made yesterday and today show that they are shook. They're worried. It means we are doing something right. Hold. HOLD. HOLLDD
It took a dip and I lost about half of my 15k investment. Who cares. Hold.    I am a millennials. I already got shafted with 3 crashes in my life so this is nothing. The one in 2009-2011 set my entire generation back. This is nothing.      HOLD YOU MUTHAFK!
Don't panic over the recent dip in $GME
This is happening because of the mass exodus of users from Robin Hood. Once the transfers go through to the other apps, things will return to normal. DO NOT PANIC SELL

RobinHoods Message on Volatility
In case it hasn‚Äôt been posted and for all to see what their excuse is...  ‚ÄúOur mission at Robinhood is to democratize finance for all. We‚Äôre proud to have created a platform that has helped everyday people, from all backgrounds, shape their financial futures and invest for the long term.   We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary. In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG. We also raised margin requirements for certain securities.  Amid significant market volatility, it‚Äôs important as ever that we help customers stay informed. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre committed to providing people with educational resources. We recently re  and expanded Robinhood Learn to help people take advantage of the hundreds of financial resources we offer and educate themselves, including how to make sense of a volatile market. In 2020, more than   million people read our articles through Robinhood Learn.  We‚Äôre committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty. We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets. We‚Äôre humbled to have helped many people invest in the markets for the first time. And we‚Äôre determined to provide new and experienced investors with the tools and resources to help them invest responsibly for their long-term financial futures. ‚Äú
How is it that these providers can stop the market due to volatility but not in this case and only after it rebounds?
This actually makes me angry to  see and im not even in any position
ITS BUYERS SZN BOIS
132 FOR GME IS A GOOD ASS BARGIN. REMEMBER THESE CUNTS LOSE A SHIT TON AND WE GAIN A SHIT TON IF THEY LOSE. JUST KEEP YOUR HANDS HARD AS DIAMONDS UNTIL SQUEEZE TOMORROW
Market manipulation at its finest
they stopped the ability to buy stocks, so they could cover their calls to avoid liquidation from the short squeeze and sell the shares back to market to artificially drop the market price. dirty pigs playing hella dirty. they can afford lawsuits. call someone who can make these guy pay
You can use Tastyworks to buy GME
Simple as that. Not a big deal. I'm not a TW shill btw.
Tastyworks joining the class-action suit as well. F these platforms!
Apex Clearing, who acts as the custodian of all tastyworks accounts, has informed us that the following symbols (AMC, GME, & KOSS) will be set to closing only order status immediately.  ¬†You will only be able to submit orders to close out any open positions that you have in these symbols.¬†     New opening orders will not be accepted at this time.¬†We will update our clients should the clearing firm lift the Closing Only status in the near future.
Have patience today for patience is rewarded.   üèª's reward are      and here is why.

How could we not see the writing on the wall with what happened yesterday? This was literally EXPECTED. They are artificially driving down the price and leaving us only with a sell option to COVER THEIR SILK SHIT ASSES. Don't paper hand this shit, we got this. For once, we got this.   This is not a get rich quick scheme. Some people have gotten lucky, I know I did. But guess the fuck what?   &nbsp;    THIS IS BIGGER THAN US INDIVIDUALS, WE HAVE THE POWER TO REWRITE HISTORY AND THE TIME IS NOW    &nbsp;  Don't cave to these queefs. If you're not reading any quality DD and you're just reading comments, I suggest you find some quality DD. Don't let emotions get to you.   This is the time to practice patience, trust the squeeze, and not be a paper handed bitch.    &nbsp;  I've only been trading for about 3 years, I'm not a professional or a financial advisor at all, don't take my word for it.  &nbsp;    I'll tell you what I've learned though. Every trade I sold for a loss in the last few years would have yielded me great returns if I just held a little bit longer.    &nbsp;  This is what's happening now. We all need to practice   üèª so we can        $GME 5K BABY

No clan can stop them, the free folk can‚Äôt stop them, the Night‚Äôs Watch can‚Äôt stop them and all the southern kings can‚Äôt stop them. Only together, all of us , and even then it might not be enough but at least we‚Äôll give the f ers a fight.

Fidelity not trading GME
Fidelity seemsto have stopped trading GME.   It is giving message "price not in pine with current bis/ask".  And it shows both bid and ask as $0 when trying to enter an order
Alright this is fucking stupid. What‚Äôs the best alternative to Robinhood?
I have an IRA with Vanguard and my 401k is with T Rowe. Where do I get my tendies now?
REVIEW ROBINHOOD IN THE APP STORE
I‚Äôve seen posts explaining how to file an SEC complaint and complain to Robinhood themselves. These are great options, but a lot of effort for the average lurker, and they may not produce an effect. Leaving an App Store rating is the easiest way to give feedback, and if enough people do it, it show their flaws to potential new customers. The same goes for any brokerage or investing app restricting trades.
You can buy AMC on cashapp
It's very easy to do, I just did it.   I'm very retarded, don't listen to me.
What's this nonsense, WeBull???
Hold the line guys it‚Äôs going back up!
They shot themselves in the foot
So hear me out. This massive short attack on GME was a way for them to try and scare us retards into giving them profit. Sure they may have made money, but we're stupid and will buy these discounted prices for the squeeze that is about to come. Pretty much they just triggered a SSR on GME. So tomorrow bois, its on! As for all you paper handed fools that sold for a loss. You're gonna be paying the price when it   to the  .   My opinion, don't take my advice for any financial advice. I'm just a dumb schmuck.
Just downloaded Fidelity, Now what?
Figured I could get some pointers on where to start but also though it would be cool for newcomers to also see how to stick it to the man. Any help is appreciated my Brothers and Sisters
YOU MAKE MONEY WHEN YOU CASH OUT
IF YOU SIT ON GARBAGE YOU WILL GET BURNED. GME IS WORTHLESS.
‚ÄúThese small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.‚Äù FUCK YOUR SOPHISTICATION THEN

No, I won‚Äôt be scared into selling
What the big banks forget is being poor means randomly losing money is a regular occurrence for me. I had to take an ambulance back in March and the bill was obviously too high for me to pay off. I lost my job with one day‚Äôs notice when Covid fucked the state I lived in. They weren‚Äôt talking about stimulus checks yet and my landlord basically told me to fuck myself when I asked for an extension on rent. I grew up poor as shit and everything from medical emergencies to natural disasters wrecked my family‚Äôs budget.  I‚Äôm not selling off my single stupid share of GME I could afford. Losing a couple hundred means literally nothing to me.   Holding through the short squeeze because fuck you.
What about go pro? That looks like the shorts are on it?

Hello I am curious as to which stocks I should purchase with the little amount of money I have. Just looking to pay for my cat's surgery honestly ... Is Betterment a good website ?
Well this didn‚Äôt age well...
DID ROBINHOOD JUST STEAL MY MONEY?
We knew this was going to happen. Stay calm, hold, and go for a walk today.
We knew they'd play dirty today. We talked about this. We stick to the plan and HOLD. If the volatility is too much for you, just step away for a few hours.   Yes, some fucked up shit happened today.  Yes, Brokerages are in on it too.   Let our ACTIONS speak for themselves, and remain calm.
An in person Protest is neccessary
This is ridiculous  Almost every major public figure that isn‚Äôt short on GME is siding with the people on this. We some form of organized, real life gathering as a protest. GME is plummeting, it is best to hold, as no way Melvin doesn‚Äôt start to cover once the price calms down. But we need some sort of effort, people can‚Äôt buy calls, puts, shares, or anything. This is absurd and not only market manipulation but just plain wrong.
WHICH ONE OF YOU FUCKS SOLD, I was hoping my 10$ would buy me a PS5
And now I'll have to suck melvin's dick to get it
Robinhood should be investigated for market manipulation
Robinhood and anyone  calling in the favors to make it harder and harder to buy GME stock should be prosecuted.   How is this not massive market manipulation? How is this even remotely legal?
The paper hands are gone!
Every single one of you that held through that has my respect. Absolutely butt clenching but this happened just before the VW infinity squeeze too. We will all tell stories about this over big tendies when we sell on MARS       Position - GME 18
Every little bit helps!
I'm in the UK and all I could afford was one BB share. I assume BB stands for Big Balls. They've played their big move, now we're on our way back up chaps!  BUY AND HOLD!
THEY DROVE THE PRICE DOWN AND THEY LOCK US OUT
DO NOT LET THEM DO THIS
ROBINHOOD are awful but its not just them. Literally all of the big online brokers are not allowing people to buy GME and AMC. THEY ARE ALL COMPLICIT.
I see alot of people rightfully pissed at robinhood but I want to make sure everybody knows it isn't just robinhood. Literally all the major brokers are blovking people from buying. Trading 212 for me in the UK is also blocking. Send them ALL lawsuits up the ass.   Also  HOLD. THE. LINE.
Help! How do I transfer my shares of stock from Robinhood to another location?
I‚Äôve only used Robinhood for trading, and am invested into a lot of long-term stocks. How do I move those investments elsewhere?  Fuck Robinhood.
How come I cannot buy 3 shares on Fidelity? It keeps saying its because the last trade price is not in line with the current bid/ask price? What does this even mean?
Help me please I JUST WANNA GO TO PLUTO WITH YOU ALL
THE DARKEST HOUR IS BEFORE DAWN STAY STRONG BOYS WE ARE RIGHT THERE !!!! DO NOT FUCKING SELL SHIT!!!
AOC STILL HAS OUR BACK BABY
Once all this is clear and we get our gains     . After the short squeezes. Let's pull all our money out of robinhood and jump to alternative.
Robinhood has tried to screw everyone in this sub over from GME to AMC, to all our fan favorites.  Let's all pull out of their shitty platform!   I was going to stay in robinhood, but screw that. After everything I read on here, its BS.  Any suggestions?  Position: GME stock holding to the moon      AMC holding too!
HOLD

Nokia went through?
Last night I said fuck it and bought 100 shares of after market close. Then this morning I see that it is not available through robinhood but just a few minutes ago the purchase went through. Anyone have an explanation?
AOC: We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp ‚Äôs decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit.
In Fidelity we trust
Every brokerage has now banned the buying of GME except Fidelity. Luckily that‚Äôs where I‚Äôve always had my money. Just liquidated everything (i was buying into other high short int stocks) and buying the dip on GME. If Fidelity becomes the last man standing and allows people to buy throughout this carnage, we must all move our money there and trade there for the future.
WE GOING TO THE FUCKING MOON - THOSE BITCHES ARE TIRED NOW - LET‚ÄôS GO
CASHAPP $AMC has canceled my orders to buy, while I‚Äôm at a loss of half my money, still holding but worried, thoughts?
We need to file a class action lawsuit against the big brokerages that pressured robinhood to stop trading.
you are only holding the bag if you sell. Keep holding
I switched to Public (App). Still allowing ALL trading of GME, AMC, NOK and other stocks I just like.
I'm holding. and buying more
Can someone explain to me when you eventually sell?
So I see all these posts about holding and not selling but when do you eventually sell?  That has to be the goal at some point?
Anyone wan to help me drive down ROBINHOOD's App Store rating?
It's still at 5 stars. An app that's falsely marketed itself as "for the people" needs to be checked.
ALL HANDS ON DECK THIS SHIT IS ABOUT TO LIFT THE FUCK OFF! KEEP HOLDING $GME, BUY $GME, MELVIN HASN‚ÄôT COVERED 90% OF THEIR SHORTS, ITS ABOUT TO SKYROCKET JUST HOLD!      ü§≤
WE GOT THIS GUYS TAKE DOWN THE FUCKERS WHO BET AGAINST US! (i‚Äôm not a financial advisor i just like the stock)
This is their last attempt to get us to sell GME. There is no volume in the market for GME today guys this is market manipulation. By tomo we‚Äôll be back on route to $1000. Just fucking HOLD!
This is all part of the story. Nobody said it would be easy. Just hold on. Put away your phone if you have to. But don‚Äôt fucking sell!
Since the market opened today, GME has been halted by Nasdaq for around half of that time.
Every 5 minutes, they halt it for 5 minutes un-halt, rinse and repeat. If this isn't market manipulation, I don't know what is.  You can view trade halts here:

Did Rohinhood know there are ALSO fucking "regular" investors?
I'm rather pissed. I bought some (just 100 stocks) from AMC 2-3 years ago or so, when they launched A-List. I've been holding since then (I genuinely hope things go well for AMC, I love their venues), and Robinhood just made my profits disappear.  Well, Robinhood - fuck you. By manipulating the casino part of your business you made me realize I can't trust you with the  long term shit either.  BTW - glad I still had my European broker account around. Bought some shit, and because it's much less convenient to use that the Robinhood app, I'm going to sit on those stocks forever.
Is it just me or did Robin Hood just light a fuse?
Webull
Webull just limited KOSS GME and AMC
Proof that I‚Äôm not lying about my last post
Dumb question: why are WSB-ers still using RH?
This isn't the first time RH has pulled shenanigans like this, and there's been plenty of ink spilled at WSB about it.    why does it still seem to popular amongst WSB-ers?     FWIW, I had no problems with Schwab today -- my pre-entered limit buy executed, and I put in another buy which also executed just fine.
In for 5 more shares at $190. ILL SELL WHEN IM DEAD

Maybe if the stopped halting every 2 minutes to give their hedge fund buddies relief...
I keep reading how stocks like GME or amc are being halted and regulated because of the huge pull back.  Not a single article addresses the fact that since when is it the job of trading platforms to regulate stock movement, when did it become ok to just stop movement because it's trying to climb and it goes against the big firms.  How are they gonna get away with this? What can we do?
Bipartisan opposition to RobinHood - Stock-blocking us
Dear RobinHood App:  You done f\ \ \ ed up. When you have Rashida Tlaib, AOC, Ben Shapiro, Ted Cruz, and DJT Jr all on the same side, it's pretty clear that you're wrong.  "Let the people trade" is supposed to be your motto. However, apparently you abandoned it just like Google abandoned their "Don't be Evil" motto when $$ showed up.  Sincerely,   A former customer

GUYS, BUY FROM YOUR BANK IF RONBINHOOD DOESNT WORK!!!!!
It's starting to turn in our favor.
Scared? Don't be, it's starting to turn, they ran out of money to keep this worthless attack going and now it will go positive.   I would say to buy right now, as the price is a steal! BB, GME!
Scared?
Hold strong.  Remember yesterday when all the posts said 'they will try every dirty trick in the book' to shake you?  Remember the diamonds?  This is where you HAVE to hold.  Just hold and they'll feel the squeeze they are do desperately trying to get out of.  This sort it response isn't because they are happy for out success.  They are terrified that the 'infinite risk' is becoming reality....  Edit: in 20 minutes the scary drop was an opportunity in hindsight, eh?
Hey, can we together create our own true democratic trading platform? WSBtrade let‚Äôs gooo

I‚Äôm rooting for all of you from the sidelines, Wall Street and big time media is so fucking disconnected from reality and what it‚Äôs like not being a part of the top 1%.  This is an opportunity to stick it to them something we may never see again after some bitch takes more control away from retail investors. Show them what you guys can do hold the fucking line we fucking LOVE. THIS. STOCK.
Move your cash out of Robinhood.
I've moved all of my cash out of Robinhood and have sold all positions except GME, AMC, NOK.  I will hold those until we win.  I will never use RobinHood again.  I believe we should all move away, let them know we have options as well.

AOC STANDS WITH US FURTHER!
Since RobinHood halted trades "for our protection" then they presumably know the future price of some of the biggest market movers. If this is the case, surely they will stop trading before the next crash to allow us to cash out, right?

Hold guys. Dont give in to scare tactics. We have to be together
Wasn‚Äôt Robin Hoods mentality rob from the rich and give to the poor?
Robinhood is nothing but sellout commie mother fuckers. I hope they go under. Market volatility? Everyday the market is a volatile environment. Market manipulation at its finest. That is all.

TLDR - If buying is blocked for the retail investor, and you and only sell. Who are you selling to?  Fuck this shit. It is personal now. I am not selling. Even if I lose all of it I'm not selling. Because if I sell the shares will be going to the hedge funds and I don't want that to happen.  I bought these share with my hard earned money. And I want to hold them. It is my legal right to decide what I want to do with them. I decide the price. If no one wants to pay me the price that I am asking for then I won't sell. It's mine.  I'm asking $  per share
IT'S CLIMBING BACK BABY. I'M HOLDING!

Want to buy more gme but only have robinhood
Guys I'm scrambling to buy gme while it's still low. Is there any platform where I can make an account and instantly start trading so I don't miss this dip?
Holding less than $1K?? YOU WILL MAKE IT BACK IN YOUR LIFETIME -- Just HOLD
I understand everyone's money is different. But guys - we did this knowing risk involved and looking for a moonshot reward and fucking the big shorts over.     "I'm scared to lose my $300"  - Dog - you will make that back in your lifetime. Don't stress. Just hold - it will be okay. Scared money doesn't make money and unless you literally refinanced your house for GME - you will be fine.     I'm a retard and not a financial analysist. This is not investment advice.

SILVER BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD $SLV 25$ to 1000$
Silver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth. Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.  All of the best mines for silver have already been depleted in recent years. There is a severe supply shortage developing. At the same time, demand is skyrocketing. Solar panels, electric cars, electronics and many other products need more silver than ever.  Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.  Inflation adjusted Silver should be at $1,000 instead of 25$.   Why not squeeze $SLV to real physical price.  Think about the Gainz. If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP MORGAN you'd be destroying along the way.  Tldr- Corner the market. Gold Ventures thinks its possible to squeeze $SLV, FUCK AFTER SEEING $AG AND $GME EVEN I THINK WE CAN DO IT. BUY $SLV GO ALL IN TH GAINZ WILL BE UNLIMITED. DEMAND PHYSICAL IF YOU CAN. FUCK THE BANKS.  If the brokerages close trading on $SLV or various silver miners, we can continue to squeeze the market by purchasing physical silver at online or local silver/gold dealers. It all trickles into COMEX to squeeze supply.  Disclaimer: This is not Financial advice. I am not a financial services professional. This is my personal opinion and speculation as an uneducated and uninformed person.
Are we not Pushing E-Trade? I‚Äôve only used that and GME has hot and ready tendies.

Turns out the dip was just a slope that   up to the moon.
BLATANT MANIPULATION. JUST AS THE DIP WAS TRENDING UPWARDS THEY HALTED GME
We‚Äôve gained   million followers since they tried to silence us. They fear us more than we fear them.
None of you are selling. I know this. None of us are selling. We all know this.
Hold. Just hold. We know they can print  new shorts in a last effort to climb out of the grave they dug. We expect this. Their play has dug their grave even deeper.

Robinhood is a $0 commission broker. But wait - how does Robinhood make money then?  THEY SELL YOUR FUCKING USER AND TRADE DATA TO HEDGE FUNDS.   WHO HAS WSB BEEN FUCKING IN THE ASS FOR THE LAST WEEK? HEDGE FUNDS.   Robin Hood knows who their master are, but they try to pretend that they are serving the retail investor. Guess what - they arent, and today proves that.  FUCK ROBINHOOD - switch to a low commission broker who isnt beholden to these fucking assholes.

New Brokerage Company
I am not one of the gainers on GME, etc. But I would like to see a new Brokerage emerge that heavily relies on supporting a free market and will have no interefrence with its customers portfolios in any way. No blocking tickers. No mainstream influence bs. Shouldn't be too expensive to start up, but if one of you neckbeards has the time and newly found money... Go become a billionaire!
Don't understand any of this, don't know how any of it works, but it's making very rich people very uncomfortable, I've got my popcorn and am cheering you on!
Heard about this as it's literally everywhere, I have no idea what's going on, don't know how any of this works, hell I'm terrible in math, all I know is that there are some very powerful people with more money than some countries who are freaking the hell out and running around like their butts are on fire, I've got my popcorn and am rooting for you, keep going, stay strong!
Something is really suspicious here with robinhood and/or the GME price...
So I have   stocks in GME via robinhood. As I have not really used the app before recently, I decided to sell .3 stocks to see how long it would take for the money to be available to deposit (that and the .3 was irking me for some reason).  At the time I sold it, GME was in the plummet and I sold it roughly when it hit the 197/share mark. As I had made the purchase when it was in the 140s, the app stated that I would get a 55 dollar profit. That made sense.    I got the actual sale confirmation     As you can see there, I made the sale roughly 20 minutes ago, when the stock was at the 190s.     the sale went through at   a share.  While I‚Äôm obviously happy I‚Äôm getting more money for the miniscule amount I sold, there seems to be something very suspicious going on with the GME pricing. I also admit I‚Äôm new at stock selling, so please correct me if I‚Äôm missing something here and I‚Äôll delete the topic.

So we‚Äòll be wait until they are done selling off shares. That should reduce their capital somewhat. While we‚Äòre acting as a decoy Captain u/dfv will kill the Wall Street. That is our plan. Selling just means we‚Äòll be showered by more losses. Get ready on the double! New retard: Are we all‚Ä¶ going to‚Ä¶hit out stop losses? Yes if you are so retarded to put a SL on this stock then yes. Cadet: If we‚Äòre gonna hit out SL anyways, you‚Äòre saying it‚Äòs better‚Ä¶ if lose everything? Yes. Wait‚Ä¶ if we‚Äòre gonna hit SL anyways, no matter how much we lose, even if it‚Äòs disobeying orders, it all means nothing, right? You‚Äòre precisely right. It‚Äòs all meaningless. No matter what dreams or hopes you had‚Ä¶ No matter how blessed a life you‚Äòve lived‚Ä¶ It‚Äòs all the same if you‚Äòre broke. Everyone will be someday. Does that mean life is meaningless? Was there even any meaning in our being born? Would you say that to our fallen comrades? Their empty accounts‚Ä¶ Were they meaningless? No they weren‚Äòt! It‚Äòs us who gives meaning to our comrade‚Äòs losses! The brave fallen! The anguished fallen! The ones who will remember them‚Ä¶ are us, the living! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world! My retards, rage! My soldiers, buy! My soldiers, hold!

Email Your Senator Copy Pasta (Use it or change it if you like)
Senator ####,     Please reign in the horrendous market manipulation currently surrounding GameStop. Several brokerages have been preventing people from buying or even SEEING stocks. Robinhood  has prevented people from seeing stocks or buying stocks with THEIR own money. If this behavior is allowed then the hedge funds who shorted MORE STOCKS than were even AVAILABLE will get away scot-free, that can't happen. This is a chance for the little guy to actually have a chance in the market instead of the market manipulating billionaires. PLEASE do not let these companies get away with hiding information and preventing people from spending their own money how they wanna use it.     Thank you,  GME to the Moon!

Greetings from Korea. Hold tight you crazy bastards
Small-time retail trader/uni student checking in. Gained quite a bit from the Korean market these past couple months and threw all my profit in on GME.  I admit, bought it a little too high and already lost a shit ton, and it hurts. Even if it goes through the roof I probably won't gain as much as most of you guys. But I feel I'm already too deep in the shit to bail out. It's money I can lose. I ain't selling EVER. You can do it. Hold and hold tight. I guarantee you, retail traders from ALL AROUND THE WORLD have your back. As I'm writing this it's already going back up. So proud of yall. Press on. Teach those manipulators a lesson.

Should the SEC halt trading on GME, AMC, BB and etc. until Robinhood allows new buy orders?
I‚Äôm curious about if the SEC will and if they should decide to halt trading on GME, AMC, NOK, BB and etc.?  They are legally allowed to and supposed to when there is a situation that can hurt investors (such as Robinhood restricting demand while pumping supply of these stocks).   I think they should because it might give them time to investigate Robinhood and open trading back up. What do you guys think would it actually be good or is there something important I‚Äôm missing?  Do you think they will halt trading? And how can we influence them to halt trading if it will help restore fairness to the market? I‚Äôm genuinely curious about this and hope someone has some insights?
If I'm reading this right we lost almost 67 million of us due Robinhood and similar trading apps banning buys.
WHAT IS THE ROBINHOOD ALTERNATIVE?
MY FELLOW WSB BROS... THIS REDDIT PUSH COULD BE A RALLY OR THE NEW NORM FOR RETAIL INVESTORS.  IS THERE A PLATFORM WE CAN SHIFT TO IF ROBINHOOD CONTINUES TO FUCK WITH EVERYONES MONEY?   KEEP BUYING AND HOLDING HOMIES.

The most convincing argument that GME is going to Andromeda
For me, the most convincing argument in the bull case for GME is the sheer panic in the brokers. They are willing to openly flaunt securities laws, they are spambotting WSB, they are actively lying on TV and YouTube...  They are in a panic and IT SHOWS.  Hold their feet to the fire. Hold it. HOLD IT.
Just an   second attack, erm, I mean buy another stock?
Just an idea. For those of us joining late to this and cannot buy or even find GME/AME/BB stocks on their Robinhood account (like I literally just searched them and they don‚Äôt even come up,) why not keep this going and for those who have GME and can buy them, buy and hold, and we look into another dying industry with hedge funds and plan another strategy? And when it is time to sell GME, we can have another place set up after the next batch of stocks? I don‚Äôt want this to be a one and done thing. Let‚Äôs keep this a continual movement. Eat the rich, baby! You can totally crucify this idea, augment it, or mods can totally delete this, I won‚Äôt be offended, just throwing it out there.

IF YOU CAN ONLY SELL THEN WHO ARE YOU SELLING TO? THE OTHER SIDE IS THUS A BUYER THIS IS BS!!
FORGET ROBINHOOD CLASS ACTION -- if you really want to fuck them... THIS IS HOW WE DO IT!!!!
Class action lawsuits are bullshit... big law firms get richer and the settlement will just be a drop in the bucket for Robinhood.  Do you REALLY want to fuck them up?!? This is how we do it: SUE ROBINHOOD IN YOUR LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT. If a company does business in your state ‚Äî¬†which Robinhood does ‚Äî¬†you can sue in small claims for up to $5,000.  If Robinhood's legal counsel doesn't appear when the case is called, ROBINHOOD LOSES.  They can't appear in 10,000 little small claims courts all across the country, so they're FUCKED.  File your SEC complaint now... and SUE THEM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT!!!  I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.
We‚Äôre getting there, but we need to keep the momentum up. REMEMBER, MONKE STORNGE R TOGETHER.

If WSB was a hedge fund, there would be no controversy
If everyone threw their money in one pot and these trades were made, it would be ‚Äúok‚Äù.  However as individuals, retail investors are alienated and manipulated into believing they have no place in Wall Street.  Threats of investigations and lawsuits with Robinhood trying to suppress stock pricing.   Yesterday funds flash dumped the market to scare people out.  It‚Äôs all a game.

It‚Äôs all a mirage and this is going to backfire in their face because they (the hedge funds) are quite literally allowing our gains to multiply.   Do some push ups. Go for a walk. Put your phone down. I KNOW IT‚ÄôS FUCKING HARD. But when this war ends, you‚Äôre life will resume as usual, albeit, with a lot more money.  We are on the world stage now. Everyone is watching. Everyone can see what‚Äôs happening. Nobody is blind. This is history in the fucking make and YOU are a part of it.  So relax, hold and laugh.   Some big motherfuckers are going down after this.  I‚Äôm not a financial advisor Blah blah blah.
Where is the protest?
I put around $50 in these stocks. Nothing huge but I am holding because you know fuck it. Its a loss but there is a slim chance things could get better. I was really here for the movement. I have been a Bernie Bro since I could vote and I felt this type of organized socialized movement of using there system to our benefit was exactly what we needed to poke the bear. What happened today on these trading apps is disgusting and shows the true hypocrisy of this country and the supposed ‚Äòfree market.‚Äô I want to do something and show these people we are real human beings and not just faceless usernames on a message board. Occupy wall street was cool and all but flawed. What‚Äôs our next move, where do we show them who we are?
CAN I STILL JUMP ON THIS ROCKET OR AM I TOO LATE ?
And if it's still possible where I can buy stocks since I saw many app blocked it
Hypocrisy Much?

Possible explanation of current market movement
These hedge funds and other shorts are being bailed out by the vile sewer rats in Wall Street because the market was down since they had to pull out of other positions to cover. They didn't like that. So they used the ultimate card, have the majority of brokers prohibit purchase and only allow sale of securities they deemed too volatile. In other words, they've been bailed out of their mistake.   They're allowed to have all the risk but none of the consequences regular investors have. Then they might let the rocket ride because there will be no consequence from there and they get to ride it up.  It's blatant manipulation of the markets to control an outcome. The House always finds a way to win. This needs to be blasted in every outlet, every forum, every influencer, everybody that might have a presence must raise their voice to address the interference of the free market.
How long until it rockets?
Because I‚Äôm an idiot I won‚Äôt have funds util tomorrow. Will it still be in the dip to buy?

Another one bites the dust: Tastyworks manipulates the market, allows sale of GME and AMC, but not buying
Just got this message from Tastyworks:  >Dear \[REDACTED\],     Apex Clearing, who acts as the custodian of all tastyworks accounts, has informed us that the following symbols (AMC, GME, & KOSS) will be set to closing only order status immediately.   You will only be able to submit orders to close out any open positions that you have in these symbols.    >   >New opening orders will not be accepted at this time. We will update our clients should the clearing firm lift the Closing Only status in the near future.   >   >Best,   >   >The tastyworks Team   What a load of absolute bullshit!  Class action!

THANK YOU WINKLEVOSS TWINS FOR CHAMPIONING THE CAUSE AND PUSHING BACK AGAINST THESE CNBC/CORPO HACKS!!!! BANNING BUYS IS SUS
Pure manipulation. Open this post and read it if you need to calm down; GME shareholders are getting close, I can feel it.
Listen, don't sell. it'll be okay.  Firstly, since I hope you're still reading; join this link        Live hype GME chat support, you don't have to update like the WSB GME sub. Amazing support.   You can tell by volume this is a short ladder attack. The bid ask spread is ridiculous; this thing will rocket like no other. They just lost capital trying to get us to sell, but NOBODY has SOLD. Breathe and hold; we have seen this thing run up 100-300 dollars in one day alone; this is the endgame. Everyone in this sub has your back.  There's something about being a part of this that is amazing. All buying on Robinhood is closed for GME, which was an attempt to kill momentum and halt the gamma squeezes (in my opinion). But hold. History will be made here one way or another. Be on the right side of it.  They can try whatever shit they want; but they don't realize that everyone on this sub is an idiot and has nothing to lose. We will never sell.  Edit: Also, look at what's happening now. They gave it everything they got to manipulate this shit down to 122, and now with every halt the trend is reversing; jumped to 155 to 196, and probably even higher next where it will get halted again. This will be okay. Put your phone down if you need to.  Edit2: Stock price is 212 now.  This is just my speculation, and is not financial advice. Do what you will with the info, I just wanted to make sure you were educated.  I own GME shares, and like the stock.
A message
Some of you are invested to the tits. Some of you have a couple shares. Some of you are watching from the sidelines.   I have my whole portfolio in this. I do not have every dollar of my existence, but I have a good chunk. I know a lot of you are really banking on this and I‚Äôm praying that you make it out.   For the rest of you, like me, this is not about money. It‚Äôs about the message. It‚Äôs about what these people have done in 2008 and are doing again today. They‚Äôve rigged the game against you, they refuse to let you win, they will pay millions and billions to screw you over before they give you a dollar.   Fight them.   For the people who lost their homes, fight. For the people who lost their jobs, fight. For the kids that went without presents on Christmas because their parents lost it all, fight. This is our chance to make this market free again. It‚Äôs our chance to rectify the wrongs, and it‚Äôs our chance to finally come out on top.   What were seeing today with Robinhood is an attack. It‚Äôs as if you had two horses racing and as soon as yours started to win, they shot it. It‚Äôs not right. It‚Äôs rigged. It cannot go unpunished. Do not rely on law, do not ask what others can do, the responsibility is on us. We must not let this scare us, we have to push on and push on harder. Take off your stop losses, take off your limit sells, fucking buy, and never fucking sell.   Fight these people, this is a war and we are on the right side. Let them know,    We are never fucking selling.
I Use Stash! Let me in on the lawsuit!!

NOKIA
Everyone's talking about GME or AMC, but for us retards who bought NOK, what to do? Tanking big.
Morgan chase is allowing trading of GME on their platform still.
Let‚Äôs list all brokers in each country that actually are allowing openly trading GME right now, so we know where to move our money when this is all over
List your country and a broker where you can currently openly trade in stocks and options of GME.  EDIT: LIST YOUR COUNTRY!!!!!!
Can someone explain what‚Äôs going on in here exactly?

What's next?
So I missed out on the initial gamestop surge in robinhood. I have thousands I want to put towards stopping these corrupt companies like Robinhood. So.. what is our next target? Tell me what the next stock is so we can stop these fuckers. This is so illegal and its hurting millions of regular people that dont have the billions of dollars to trade with. Let's cripple these fuckers
BUY GME, HOLD!!
GME TO THE MOON, DONT SELL
[Webull] Due to the extreme volatility in the symbols AMC, GME, and KOSS, our clearing firm will no longer be able to support clearance on these symbols. As a result, Webull is forced to set all transactions in these symbols to liquidate only.
Uh-oh
Is it worth contacting our state representatives to do something if the SEC sides with these scoundrels?
Not sure if it's a dumb question but it seems the SEC has only turned a blind eye to these groups of companies fucking the little man. Is it worth contacting our senators or house reps to make a move?  Warning: if this doesn't make sense I admit I'm a    so I'm typically on the wrong side anyways.
Fellow autists we did it! I remember finding this a while ago and thinking it was a little autistic. Although people kept saying this sub should almost become like a public hedge fund. Well CNN said we are a worthy opponent.
Can one of you post an idiot-proof list of steps to migrate my assets out of Robinhood? Perhaps in meme format?
I don't want to close my positions I just want to move them the hell out of RH. Show us all the way.

It's not Robinhood, its Apex their clearing firm
See here for clearing firms:    Note that RH and TW and many others use Apex, and its Apex forcing the issue here on GME etc. TDA/IB/others should be fine, or at least its their own decision.  TW says its Apex setting the rules here.
HOLD! HOLD! HOLD!
SWIM TOGETHER!
It‚Äôs pretty likely Wall Street / MSM etc. will use Robinhood as a scapegoat - DONT FORGOT THE WHOLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS F   ED!!

Move out of robinhood
Their money is obviously directly connected to these hedge funds. They did not allow buying but allowed selling. That showed you this was a direct attack on us
BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD!!!!!
They are scarred. They locked us out. STOP SELLING! They are gonna offload a bunch of stock to make it tank and scare your üìÉ  . Stay strong. Buy more if you can. They STILL have a bunch of open PUT interest on this. Check for yourself.
You sit there, locked out, watching it tank. Don't be nervous. Buy more. Lower your avg cost. They still have this short as hell and from what I understand. Lookup the Open Put Interest yourself.  It's like 2x the the Open Call Interest. Now go check Apple, see how they are inverted compared to GME? That's because the hedge funds know Apple is going up! So they are NOT shorting it. The squeeze is STILL on for GME. Fidelity is still trading them like a great American company who believes in free market should! Unlike #Robinhood or #TDAmeritrade.
Is Fidelity a good site to switch to from Robinhood?
Hi folks,  For obvious reasons, it's time for me to get my small position in various stonks out of Robinhood. I'm not selling, but I can't support Robinhood now. I don't know that much about what to look for in a brokerage account, but I have a 401k in Fidelity so I'm inclined to open an account there. Is that a good site in which to open an account? Are they allowing trading of these trending stocks right now, like GME, BB, etc? I want an account somewhere that allows for free trading.  Thanks for any info.
AMC and NOK falling ?
I bought a bunch of shares in AMC and NOK as per looking what has been said here and only to find it down by a ton this morning, is that part of the same market manipulation as GME in how that dipped ? Don‚Äôt sell them right ?
CASHAPP JUSR LET ME BUY THE FUCKING AMC DIP ITS THE ONLY ONE LEFT BUY LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT
THIS IS NOT A FUCKING DRILL RETARDS BUY LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT GO GO GO
Excellent advice right here...
This is personal
We can‚Äôt let wallstreet fucks win BUY AND HOLD YOU DEGENERATES!!!!! TO INFINITY AND FUCKING BEYOND!
Sowhile I wait for any brokerage to process my account creation, who do I buy that RH hasn't blocked?
I'm all in, let's fuckin' go
Pull your cash out of robinhood
Close ant position that arent the banned ones on robinhood and initiate a transfer out of RH to show our discontent. Money talks
RH filed my gme sell at 1k per share
Just dropped another ~$5K to GME. BUY THE DIP AND HOLD
Serious: Who is allowed to buy GME on Robinhood?
So I get it that it's a really thin market right now on both the buy and the sell side. I'm guessing the current bids are coming outside of RH through other brokerage houses. I sold a share of GME this morning in pre-market trading on RH at 9:09AM. Who was the counterparty? I thought pre-market was only from one RH account to another RH account and I thought no one was allowed to buy at that point. Did they allow folks with larger accounts to continue to buy? Did they make some side deal with one of the big shorts to direct all sold shares to them? Just trying to get some clarity here. Ideas welcome....
I have just started watching CNBC and all I have to say is...
Is this really the financial analysis/journalism that goes on in this country?  These people are attacking the Winklevoss twins for questioning why many trading platforms are restricting $GME stock from being purchased. They are defending hedge funds and smart money. How are these people still in business?  That was the most asinine segment I have ever watched.   Position: 800ish shares GME @ $38
Welp sold my portfolio all in on GME
Uh oh. More are trying to stop us I guess. What do we do when they all shut us out? Does anyone do thier own clearing ?
I see all the RobinHood hate. Please dont move to TDAMERITRADE they are royally screwing me as well. SEC needs to hear us.
TDamertrade being super shady as well. First off yesterday they completely crashed on open. When it came back up they let us know GME,AMC was restricted which drove the price down alot. AH it gained some traction so i bought more shares.   Fast forward to today I go to execute my sell orders and it keeps freezing out anytime GME or AMC goes up and i click on the stock to the point that the app is completely unusable up until recently (notice the spike back up for a minute) I Battled with this all morning since open today and yesterday. Market manipulation at its finest. After being on hold with them for three hours this morning (huge call volume i know im not the only one) They also ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù marked my account as PDT violation this morning while i was sleeping! I woke up to that! they say it will be fixed tomorrow but voided and will stand as PDT if I buy anything.   Folks this is attacks on us, attacks on the stock market. This is the big dogs using every dirty card imaginable to get there other big wig billionaires to the top again. I already did my part in informing SEC not that they give a shit.   I messaged TDameritrade and the response was ‚Äúwe decided to make it harder to trade these stocks to protect ourselves and our clients. WHAT A LOAD OF SHIT YOU LOST ALL OF YOUR CLIENTS A LOT OF MONEY.   This is absolutely unacceptable. I hope all fellow TDameritrade users that experienced these issues also report them to the SEC. And any other platform. Yes robinhood got hit but so did a ton of other platforms. We need to stand together against these corporate bullies!
You can transfer assets out of Robinhood
BUT A $75 FEE? FUCK OFF.
just bought in at $260 as it rallied from $120
i kept putting in limit but orders at $20 above the current price but it was jumping too fast.  finally caught it at $260  this is so stupid i think im in love  fuck wall street
üèºü§öüèº LOST 600 BUT IM HOLDING
I‚ÄôM NOT LETTING GO, WE CAN STILL TURN THIS ROUND! (Not financial advice)
Just bought another 125 BB its so cheaaap lets gooo
ThANK YOU WINKLEVOSS TWINS
A+ interview! They didn‚Äôt want you to keep going because they can‚Äôt back up their lies
We are here. Hold the damn line. Hold. This is personal.
These hedge fund crones think we are pussies who'll sell.
I really like this stock. I'm not selling baby, holding this out.  If I was someone else with this stock, I would also hold it.  I wouldn't let them trick me into selling.    I'm not a financial advisor and this isn't advice, I'm just a retard.
UK brothers and sisters Freetrade are still allowing GME BB AMC trading and instant account topups on iOS          to the moon
This is a poker game, the big stack's bluff got called and they've called a break which they're using to intimidate the dealer
Let's hear your metaphors/similes for the current situation at hand.
RobinHood Collusion
Speculation of what's going on: Robinhood gets most of their order flow routed from a company called Citadel.    Citadel invested Billions in Melvin Capital, who was the company losing BILLIONS as GME kept running up.    It's theorized that - MAYBE - Citadel stopped routing purchase order flow for Robinhood, and for them - a class action lawsuit would be cheaper than GME continuing to potentially rise, where they lose billions.    What a mess. Just a theory though. Absolutely all of this is just a guess. I'm likely wrong and this is not fact. Don't listen to me at all.
Robinhood should have to legally change their name to The Sheriff of Nottingham
Too bad they didn't live up to their name and are actually the villain of our story. Steal from the poor and give to the rich is their real motto.
AOC for SEC Chairmanship

Taking back off Bois
Let  the free market reign!  Fuck Robinhood!   To the ashes or to the moon
Please contact your representatives in Congress
Use Twitter or email via their website. Demand an investigation into the cabal that conspired to manipulate the stock price of GME on behalf of the billionaire class by suspending trading. I did. Works every time.
PEACEFUL
IF EVERYONE GOES TO THEIR BANKS AND WITHDRAWS $20 DOLLARS FROM THEIR ACCOUNTS, THIS WILL CRASH THE BANKS BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE THE MONEY FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS TO DO THAT.  Think about it.
CNBC JUST SAID THE DOOR WAS OPEN FOR WALLSTREETBETS TO COME ON THE SHOW AT THE END OF THE WINKLEVOSS TWIN INTERVIEW
Dear: Wall St
Welcome to Free Market Capitalism. Now that your rigged game has been completely exposed, the only way to save yourselves is to destroy yourselves. You did it to yourself.  PS. If Qanon posts about WSB. Stonks are going into the quantum great awakening sphere or whatever the hell they talk about.
Hedge Funds Have Our Back Here...
Guys... as of an hour ago nobody can buy GME through their retail accounts. It crashed hard and went from 500 down to 130 in an hour or so... But now it is bouncing back and at 240, a 80% increase in minutes. If retail investors can't buy, wouldn't this imply other hedge funds were in on the action?
Thank you for the dip

Webull has fallen - clearing firm no longer supporting clearance on $GME, $AMC, and $KOSS
To the Homies
I‚Äôve enjoyed watching all this. I‚Äôm not a whale by a long shot, working with underpayed-professional money. I didn‚Äôt get into GME on time but I got into the others (buy the dip!).  I‚Äôm astonished about the blatant manipulation going on by the powers that be, but also kicking myself for believing people really followed the rules to begin with.  So eff that, nothing I hate more than people telling me what to do and then turning around and doing the opposite. The 2008 protests didn‚Äôt work and shenanigans are once again afoot. Fine. I should have realized that protests don‚Äôt affect the rich. Losing money does.  Even with my paltry sums I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm holding.  Trench warfare and they‚Äôve employed the gas! Masks on and Godspeed      (This is not financial advice. Do whateeeveer ya want)
Help me decide my next (and possibly last) broker
I wish to switch from T212 for their involvement in market manipulation and   anyone using traderepublic? Can you buy GME there? And I found that degiro also kept their tegrity, by allowing the purchase of GME shares.  So it's either Traderepublic or Degiro, I also welcome any other suggestions.     Edit: Forgot to mention im an europoor

A Letter to ROBINHOOD
Dear Robinhood,  According to famous English folk lore, Robin Hood is known for stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. WHAT THE FUCK is this! Stop being pushed around by these boomer hedge funds, and give the power back the people. You‚Äôre tarnishing the very thing your company is named after. FUCK YOUUUUU!   Sincerely,   A WSB retard who has more respect for themselves than a sorry multi billion dollar company.
My order was cancelled at 9:20
So my Robinhood order was cancelled but now I can‚Äôt transfer the money back to my bank?? WTF  Though my bank isn‚Äôt showing  any pending withdrawals either??  I was going to move it elsewhere but now idk.
Where is Jim Cramer?
He hasn't tweeted since the 26th, and yesterday he didn't say a word about what happened. Whats going on?
F ck RH. Etrade and fidelity still on. Could only transfer 1k because it‚Äôs new. Buy and hold the dip!!!
WHERE DO WE BUY $GME
Once robinhood opens GME back up eventually are we coming with literally the strongest front since Normandy!
Reminder that just because the big number is going down that DOES NOT MEAN THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE WINNING. They only come out of this on top of GME falls substantially below where it was when this all started by tomorrow, and stays there all week.
Set up your alternate accounts now and be ready to buy back in as soon as possible, but right now __JUST HOLD__ ü§ù .  We are winning, even if we have to lose thousands of dollars to do it.  Not financial advice btw, I‚Äôm massively unqualified to give that.
THE ETRADERS HAVE GOT YOU, LADS! 80K IN. HOLD FAST!
Class action isn‚Äôt enough. Where else are they short?
A class action won‚Äôt do shit to these fuckers. Where else are they short, I‚Äôve got $50k ready to buy buy buy and take these pussboy funds down who the fuck else is with me???
Down 1,600 and HOLDING! BB TARDS UNITE!
Of course THE MARKET IS QUIET, ROBINHOOD is literally stopping us from fucking trading!!!!! PS I still haven‚Äôt sold, don‚Äôt get scared guys!
GME - trust the process, take a break, it‚Äôs gonna be just fine
If you‚Äôre stressing about GME, don‚Äôt. Float is on our side and nothing is gonna happen quick enough for you to miss the action. This is all just psych out tricks by the hedge funds. Take a break, take a walk, come back in an hour.   Trust the process. $1000 next stop if you hold firm
This is war and I‚Äôm here for it.
AOC Backs the WSB and demands action against Robinhood
Robinhood message to GME and other stocks being restricted
Here‚Äôs what Robinhood just put out. Saying  . Are you on Citadels dick so much you hurt your users. RH are conforming to the citadels of the world, like a bunch of prosties getting a $5 for a hand job.
I don't have much money. But I'm in it for you guys.
stop limit?
Do stop limits sell immediately
Risk Tolerance? Where was the media during these other WSB events
Where was the media when 1RONYMAN told us about his infallible box spread strategy. It literally could not go tits up.  Where was the media when analfarmer2 rose like the god that he was and then lost it all.  Where was the media when our GUH lord and savior recorded himself losing his entire portfolio while casually burping.  Where was the media when this sub was all about MU 90C, MSFT 200C, weekly SPY FDs, the PRPL craze, AMD, COTY, PLTR, BYND, SQ, and BECKY portfolios.  This sub has been averse to risk tolerance and diversification for a long time. CNBC AND WALL STREET ARE ONLY SAYING THIS NOW TO HELP THEMSELVES. Don't fall for any of it, don't be discouraged because Robinhood and other platforms won't let you buy, and most importantly, do not lose hope during this historic event.     Have you heard of GME? I really like this stock
GET PHUCKED PAPERHANDS AND NORMIES
We're going to the moon now. This is just fueling up.  Get rekt Melvin  Choke on my genital thing Citadel.     HOLD THE LINE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
REPOSTING THIS! ALL SHOULD BE AWARE! HOOOLDDD
reposting another's wise words! GUYS Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.  It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.  DFV could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.  These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.  Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.  Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.  This is a repost!!!!!!
Bought the dip
I bought the dip on gme and now it‚Äôs alive        Edit: platform E TRADE
Trading limitations placed on GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry!
This has to be illegal! How can they halt trading cause they are losing money... this is not the free market!

This retarded quote from my daily calendar is fitting for today.
They Think They Can Control Everything... Not Today Autists, Not Today.
The Real Reason Why Robinhood Banned GME
For those of y'all that are living under a rock,   that they will suspend buying options and shares of WSB stocks like GME "in light of the recent volatility", while re-iterating that they're about democratizing finance and promoting free access to financial markets despite literally shutting it down. I'm surprised noone pointed out the obvious reason on \ why\  they did this so I've decided to take a few minutes out of my day to talk about it. In one word -   Citadel  .  How do y'all think Robinhood is able to offer zero-commission trades? How do they make money? Since they're ironically not public yet, that info isn't well known, but it was reported back in 2018 that they received 40% of their revenue from  , they found that consumers usually got a worse price point from their order flow being sold to Citadel, totaling in $34 Million in worse trading prices. These trades aren't actually zero commission, the fees are just hidden.  The recent events of the past few days was probably very costly for Citadel because  1. They are a market maker 2. They literally invested billions into Melvin  I'd suspect the market maker side being a bigger issue for them (although the Melvin reason is a pretty direct and obvious link between Citadel's financial interest and GME's price) and here's why. First, if you don't know what a market maker, Delta / Gamma hedging, or how stock options work,   and come back here. Basically, although theoretically there is a "perfect price" for each option according to Black-Scholes, the market maker would need to know the "implied volatility" to figure out this magic number. They have teams of hundreds of quants being paid $1M+ / year whose jobs it is to create a mathematical model of these stocks to figure this out. Obviously, their math didn't account for a subreddit causing a stock's IV to shoot through the roof, and hence they're probably losing billions each day this continues happening.  Anyways, Citadel clearly has a financial interest in taking down GME, at least for saving their billions of dollars invested in Melvin if not because they're losing billions of dollars from the options they wrote. They control enough of Robinhood's revenue to strong-arm them to forcing them in shutting down trading for these tickers that are losing them money, and they seemed to have done.  Unsure if this is actually legal, but this definitely should be. To any SEC investigators combing through r/wallstreetbets trying to find fraud for some reason - you're looking at the wrong place.  TLDR; Robinhood sold out retail investors to Citadel who is trying to save billions of dollars by making sure GME goes down.  EDIT - Just found out someone typed up basically a   while I was writing this, so i guess someone did point this out, but hopefully y'all still find this useful.
FIRST Robinhood now Webull
Webull won't let me buy AMC or GME
I"M NOT SELLING. FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD.
What The Fuck Just Happened?
Just sold   shares at $1,  on accident???  I'm only in for $100 so I'm happy with $200 gain, but very confused.
#BoycottRobinHood (When all this settles down, we should seriously consider that)
Shameless market manipulators. Nuff said.  Positions: BB, GME
Transfer your positions out of RobinHood to a broker that is allowing all stock trading
Don‚Äôt sell and move. Do a transfer. It holds your positions. This is the only way that you can fight avainst any brokers not allowing trading.    A lawsuit does nothing. Nobody is going to give you your money back. Class action usually enriched the lawyers only.   Congress hearings won‚Äôt give you your money back.   Only you can get your money by holding and transferring to a broker that allows trading of all stocks you hold.
For European retards, Revolut is allowing again to trade GME, AMC and others
Just that, buy the dip you retards!
Some of you may remember me on my $100K AMC loss. As your leading AMC degenerate. BUY NOW!
TLDR loss 100K on AMC calls during pandemic and expired too soon. It‚Äôs not too late to reverse the gains!  For the people, for me, for you, for your families. For US WE SHALL BUY AND HOLD AMC!!!
Honorary Autist Award goes to AOC
This is just the beginning
This is what I thinking is going to happen. We are all fucked this week because we don‚Äôt have enough time for the Robinhood retards to move all their monies to other brokers. The majority of Robinhood users will go to other brokers and by the time they transfer their monies it‚Äôs going to be well into next week.  So buy the fucking dip you retards!!!
What if we bet against Robin Hood?
?
SoFi is allowing trading on GME!
It's not as fast or as capable as other apps, but I was able to grab a share just now.
Citadel is behind Robinhood and won‚Äôt let retailer buy GME AMC SNDL. Quit using RH!
It was our f  king mistake to make!
I've spoken about how was it was that people were gonna get screwed for their hopes and ideals in this gamestop thing.  I still stand by that position, but trading markets just made this story even worse.  They have collectively blocked any purchases of these stocks.  They just used their institutional power to end this and no matter what their actual intent may be, to everyone out here it will look like the rich just told the non-rich in very very clear terms that they do not give one shit about what we want.  They will lie, cheat, steal, and use their institutional power to block our opportunities to compete and the whole fucking system including politicians and media will not say a single thing about those abuses except to gaslight us about it.  This right here is why people wanted Trump (I'm a liberal).  They see that the system is rigged against us and they decided they wanted change even if it meant burning everything down.  This was wrong and it's absurdly disheartening.  üò•
CALLING ALL HETEROSEXUALS TO SHOOT BBW INTO THE SKY
It has started to rise!!
It has already rose to 200 dollars now after the dip, its recovering!! Go my homies!! Buy and hold, it's about to reach new heights now!!  I am not investing as I am underage, I am just here to cheer you guys!! Get it to 1000!!
Webull Now Blocking Buy Orders
Following in Robinhood's footsteps, Webull is now no longer allowing people to buy GME, AMC, BB, NAKD, etc. You are only allowed to sell. Can we get another class action going?
You can buy GME on ETRADE
ETRADE is still allowing people to buy GME. Plus if you have a company stock plan through them YOU ALREADY HAVE A BROKERAGE ACCOUNT TOO. They support same day wire transfers (but there is a fee).   HOLD STRONG. BUY THE DIP.  This is not financial advice, just a fellow retard trying to stick it to the shorts.
AOC going after robinhood.
So much for webull... just so you guys know
AMC
I‚Äôve been trying to buy shares from AMC but the transaction never go through. When I checked today Robinhood hide it. They‚Äôre really fighting hard to prevent us from buying more shares.
Should be illegal
All my money is tied in RH and I can‚Äôt even buy. Awesome ü§°ü§°ü§°
Set up your e trade accounts and get ready for next week. Don‚Äôt sell your shares on RH!
There‚Äôs still shorts next week Tards! Regroup and let‚Äôs take this thing further next week! GME BB NOK
HOLD THE LINE. THEY ARE DOING LADDER SALES
Guys SOFI invest is allowing both GME and BB to be purchased.
I‚Äôm bike as all hell but I‚Äôm liquidating the $20 I had in other penny stock and throwing it at BB. Doing my tiny part.  . SEC go eat a bag of dicks.
KEEP BUYING AND FUCKING HOLD, MAKE ROBINHOOD EAT DIRT
Help with buying more GME
Poured $1000 into GME on RobinHood yesterday, Robinhood literally stole from the poor and I panic sold at a $650 loss. I can‚Äôt even search GME on my Robinhood app, but I want to take the rest of the money out of there and buy back in on a different platform. Which platform can I use and quickly? Fuck the institution. I am so sad today, and I am sorry for panic selling. I‚Äôm trying to right my wrong and buy and hold, even if that means losing the whole $1000z
Hey Robinhood: open up trading before Friday open or get ready for a boycott
Robinhood is aimed at retail investors and wallstreetbets users should make up a sizeable chunk of their userbase. If we collectively and publicly refuse to use them it should hit their wallet and hurt their chances at a successful ipo. We have power and we have a voice. Let's let it be heard to make them do what's right.  Who's with me?
Holding on to GME NOK AMC BB
We got this.
üá¨üáß Bought BB stock at 21, suffered the loss, now buy the dip! Panic selling IS AN OPPORTUNITY
The dip is being snapped up by everyone who can still buy, its insane - buy gme, buy bb, buy amc - this panic selling is an opportunity!

Where are our tickers available to buy? Where should RH customers move?
I heard Webull allowed GME buys, but now I read GME was suspended there (perhaps it was just the circuit-breaker).   I like the Robinhood app and their ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù (instant deposits, options, etc.). So which brokerage has a decent mobile app, has similar features, and most importantly, IS NOT A TOTAL FUCKING SELLOUT?   Let‚Äôs build a consensus on the best RH alternative so can start planning the exodus.   Wait until your positions are in the green if you want before closing them and transferring out your cash; unless the new brokerage has a good account transfer service.

TIME TO PROTEST
I think we need to put real-world pressure on the people who are openly stealing from us.  Citadel is blatantly manipulating the market to protect their positions, and stealing from us in the process. Lots of us have already filed SEC complaints and plan to join a class-action lawsuit that is almost certainly forthcoming.  However, in the mean time, I think we ought to actually show up in person and protest this injustice.  Ken Griffin is the founder/owner of Citadel and is worth about $15bn. He is possibly the most high profile individual who is profiting the most by stealing from us. I say we protest outside Citadel's Chicago office.  131 S Dearborn St, Chicago, IL 60603  Get out there and get loud.   I AM ADVOCATING PEACEFUL PROTEST. This 100% is not condoning violence or criminal behavior. Any such stupidity will absolutely make things worse. But a loud, peaceful protest that the media can't ignore would at least get some eyeballs on this unbelievable corruption and criminality.
Winklevoss Twins destroying CNBC reporters
If you're watching CNBC (please don't), the winklevoss twins are duking it out and backing WSB when CNBC is saying WSB is not legit.   Straight up called out the black reporter as he got aggressive against them.  Please watch their interaction on YouTube and know these guys are saying the right thing and that decentralization is gonna be what we need in the market.
Recent events show the importance of diversifying your trade platforms
"Divide you means seven ways, or even eight, for you do not know what disaster may happen on earth."    \-Ecclesiastes    It has been considered axiomatic that you should diversify your investments. Recent events have now shown us you need to diversify you brokerages as well. Even if you love who you are using, I would highly advise everyone to open up a secondary and tertiary brokerage account somewhere else.      Press F to show respect for Robinhood users.

In it to Win it
I'm out of buying power in my portfolio that I am comfortable with. I wish I got in sooner this week, but I am currently sitting at a measly 23 shares. I have had to battle through with Schwab saying GME is not a recognized stock ticker, they restricted buying/selling certain items due to "recent market volatility to protect investors." Protect from what? Gains in the market? I understand the risk, that is why I have an individual brokerage account and I'm not doing this in my IRA.  Unreal how these corporations/apps are trying to slow down the growth of this.  I'm on board with all of you. Diamond hands. Lets go and hold to the squeeze.   I LOVE THE STOCK AND I'M GLAD TO HAVE SET FOOT IN THIS CASINO.  \ \ \ I am not a financial advisor, this post reflects my opinion alone.\ \ \

BUY GME ON DISCOUNT, TO THE MOON

GME closed at 147 on TUESDAY!!! It's up 70% since then even with the downward move today!
If I told you on Monday that GME was going to be at 200+, and people were SCARED of it dropping, you'd be ecstatic about it. This is still an AMAZING week and this is NOT THE END. HOLD THE LINE
CLASS ACTION COMING
upload proof of restrictions you experienced today. photos and time s  and everything you have. put it here. i have already contacted my lawyer in LA. he is famous for class actions. he will probably take this up. if not him, i am sure there will be at least a few law firms getting in on this action.
White House said they "have their eye on" the GME situation
Where the fuck are they now? Write to your state senators and congressmen letting them know your displeasure with this, and how it will affect your voting. If your representative is a Republican, say you voted for them but it's clear what their interests are, and your next vote is going to the Democrats. If your representative is a Democrat, do the same thing but threaten to vote for the GOP Rep next time. Both sides are dirty as fuck and will only listen when you threaten their power.
The cavalry has arrived bois.

GME LAWSUIT?
Won't GME have grounds for a lawsuit since all these brokerages have been interfering with the purchase of their stock?  It potentially has cost them billions in lost investment revenue no?

Fuck those assholes.  I started the transfer  process today and will close the account once all that is complete.
Question
How does stock trading work and how do I make money from it?
I‚Äôm doing my part!
PSA: Fuck Robinhood! You can transfer ALL of your positions to another brokerage account of your choosing and if you ask they may cover RH's $75 fee.
You keep your dates of acquisition for tax purposes and can transfer it all in one go unlike selling and transferring the cash.  FUCK RH!

Worth a call to Palo Alto Police? California Corporations Code Section 25540(b)
Under California Corporations Code Section 25540(b),   willfully engaging in market manipulation  , making a false or misleading statement in a securities transaction or engaging in insider trading is punishable by two, three or five years in county jail or state prison and fine of up to $10 million.   Anyone care to file a criminal complaint against Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood Co-Founder and Co-CEO, and Vlad Tenev, Robinhood Co-Founder and Co-CEO?
We, the people
For more than a century they have trapped us in this financial system where we have to work to pay them dividends. We were forced to give them the biggest bail out in history after the 2008 crisis, which was caused by them and by them only. The bail out was paid by old people generating debt, which is to be paid by younger generations. They have been stealing our future prosperity every day. As small as a simple stock like GME may seem, do not forget: they might have the billions of dollars, boats, the media and contacts, but the power, the real power, the real thing, comes from we, the people. Do not be misled by anything else.   Proud of everyone. May this be the beginning of a change.
GME TRADING ON ETORO AGAIN üêÇüìà
Moral Booster Post for GME and other stocks :) It's not over bros. It'll be okay. See through their bullshit and buy the dip, you'll be rewarded.
TLDR; Buy the dip - warren buffet     So today they tank the price on extremely low volume, 20 million traded today ONLY as opposed to hundreds of millions a few days ago. They blocked trading, they are fearmongering in media, what else is new? They don't want you to win, the game has always been rigged. You want to actually make meaningful change? There has never been a better time. Show to them that you're better than them, that you will make a stand. If you don't, life will go on as always. Taking a stand now though will potentially change the whole course of society.   Do you really think the big boys won't fight for us? Hell, Elon may be so mad now that he straight up buys Gamestop. Like he cares. His net worth fluctuates by GME's float every day.   Buy the dip. That's how you make money. Not with FUD. Not with emotions. You were salivating at not getting in earlier. You didn't sell at $470. And you're selling now?   You know what I think?   Processing img v1d8xebqq3e61...   A few days ago we were celebrating $60. Nothing has changed. They still need to cover.     Been in $GME since $14 but personally I liquidated my entire portfolio just now to buy into GME at $200. Salty that I didn't get it at $119, my broker didn't execute the sale. Upped my cost basis by $100. Whatever.      pls not financial advice, I am a dummy.
Cash App
Cash App finally accepted my buy for AMC and NOK. Not allowing to search for GME tho but I‚Äôm glad I made it to something! To the moon guys we got this!  üåï‚ú®
We know there's manipulation going on right now, but are we looking at it the wrong way?
Genuine thought here    None of us have been able to buy shares during this massive dip, we all know what's going on with Robinhood, Interactive Brokers etc not allowing shares to be bought.  BUT when they suddenly allow us to buy again, and we're well under $300 a share, what is our instinct? To go and buy more fucking shares... But are we fighting a losing battle when the suits have all had their chance to load up at $119 a share?     Are we being played for suckers if we keep on buying after all of this?
I know it‚Äôs not much but you guys really make a good case. A first for me. Fuck the suits. GME to the       üåï
lmao the dip didn't lasted even 20 min
going back up
You too, TastyWorks?
The one thing I learned from this today is that I am going to short the fuck out of you, Robinhood at your IPO

ZOM: Should I cash out now? Or weather the storm?
Disclaimer: I know there is MASSIVE hate against RH right now, and it will get buried under the gamestop situation... but im still at an impass.  \[Crossposted from   r/StockMarket\]     Back in late July I set up a RH acct and dabbled in the market.   I  looked up some penny stocks and found ZOM (Zomedica)  trading at something around  15 cents at the time, so i bought 100ish shares. As a bit of a joke to  myself.  As time went on, I bought  other stocks and it never moved. In late NOV I cashed out a bunch of  other ones, and since I didnt want my money just sitting in the acct I  dumped it all in the ZOM, netting me like 2000ish shares.  Low and  behold in Dec it started to go up, and all of a sudden in early Jan it  spiked to   a share.  I had ZERO  idea why this happened, and admittedly, I never even bothered to see  what the company did or was. Turns out their a veterinarian medical  supplier, and they recently developed a software/hardware for detecting  inhouse (not having to send off) adrenal and thryoid disorders in  dogs/cats which goes to market in late march. On top of that, some  greedy person paid Carol Baskin (yes THAT Carol Baskin) to make a cameo  talking about ZOM and posted it online, which was the reason for the  spike.  TL;DR - Its normalized to  about  95 cents per, and no matter how i slice it, i have made a profit.  But my question is, knowing very little about the market, the  volatility, and how distro/sales of their product Truforma could affect  the stock price, should I sell now, and be happy with my money... OR....  weather the storm and hope for another legit rise in late March, early  April?
How do I open a trading account? How do I help?
I know nothing of stock trading and am broke want to help and throw a few bucks at GME. How do I set up an account on another app other than Robinhood?
CANADIANS! IT IS TIME FOR THE MOOSE KNUCKLES OF THE NORTH TO BUY $GME! IT MAY BE EB GAMES OR ELECTRONICS BOUTIQUE TO US, BUT IT IS GAMESTOP FOR US ALL! LOCK ANTLERS WITH OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOURS APE ARMS! TO THE MOON
Money pending on RH, but withdrawn from bank
I deposited money on Tuesday but my account never got approved till this morning... so now I can‚Äôt buy GME or send money back to my bank account. I‚Äôm too retarded for this bullshit
The game is rigged. They will do whatever it takes to ensure that the little guy stays on bottom.
I always knew this in a way, but I didn‚Äôt think they would be so blatant about it. And frankly, I am a little heartbroken. But mostly, I‚Äôm angry. In fact, I‚Äôm fucking livid. I didn‚Äôt have a big money stake in GME like a lot of you (I lost about 20% of my acct between gme bb and nok this morning), but I yolo‚Äôd my heart. I‚Äôve been following this saga intensely, cheering on all you fucking degenerates raping and pillaging the Melvin‚Äôs of the world, and it gave me hope. Hope for world where all the little guys could band together and put up a real fight against these rich fucking clowns.   Today, they dealt a pretty big blow. But they showed their desperation. These needle dicks sacrificed a multi-billion dollar brokerage in order to save their asses. They committed potentially the largest, most blatant fraud in our lives. And if they think they are going to get away with it, they are about to get a nice wake up call. They are about to get a bucket of cold piss dumped on their head. Because this is not the last they will hear from us.   Today was the battle of bunker hill. We suffered some casualties, sure. But we saw what we could accomplish. These dick suckers are shaking in their cunty little boots. This is just the beginning boys. They have no idea what they have started. They may have money, but we have a god damn HORDE. They don‚Äôt even know the meaning of retard strength! Let‚Äôs burn this fucking thing to the GROUND!!!!!
Pardon the absolute SHIT ASS of a trading platform that is making my drawing look like crap. Thank you mods for being awesome and foreign peeps for buying the dip. I will be rid of RH once my hands stop stinking of diamonds and space rocks
I leave in INDIA and I can‚Äôt do anything to support you except giving my moral Voice. DON‚ÄôT SELL BECAUSE WE NEED THOSE MF CLOWS ON THE STREET FOR WHAT THEY DID! LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GOOOOO

Any idea what happened here?
I'm a lurker no   pulled the trigger on buying some GME.
I could only afford 10 shares. I used Fidelity website to make the purchase. I hope I'm doing this right.     EDIT: I guess I used the wrong flair, so I just cleared it.
Time for Wall Street to call an electrician! I‚Äôve never seen the circuit breakers trip this often.ü§£
go winklevoss twins - they put cnbc and the establishment on the line - and now we see how truths uncoil
well done WSquared!!!!!!!!

AMC cavalry here to join the GME fun
Finally got in at $120 and ready to die on this fucking hill. I believe GME just took wall streets best punch. The best is yet to come.
Note to all sellers
Robinhood is attempting to make you Melvin's, Citron's, and Citadel's b\ tches.    By only allowing selling there is no market balance and EVERY seller becomes a short seller.  The big boys are out of ammo, they can't create more to short and cause the price to plummet; so they are now using the common folk to do their shorting.    Again, when you sell in a market with no able buyers, or limited buyers, you flood the bid and basically become the short seller.    THE RESULT: Melvin no longer has to drive the price down before Friday, you are doing it for him.  BTW I'm no financial adviser and don't recommend you buy anything that doesn't have Ketchup on it.  Do your own thing.
For all my fellow Brits, Hargreaves Lansdown is once again allowing the purchase of GME stock (no min/max either). Buy during the dip and all aboard to Mars!
See you all on Mars.. toodle-oo, pip pip and all that.
ETRADE IS STILL TRADING $GME, $  !Discussion!

On which trading platforms can you still buy fractional shares in NOK, AMC, GME an NAKD?
Trading platforms in the UK, please
HALTING EXPLAINED
There is massive manipulation in the form of halting occuring in TD Ameritrade. Dunno if it's happening on other brokers, but LITERALLY every few seconds the market opens it halts again.   This seems illegal so I did the lightest amount of research.      This is -NOT- illegal for them to do. It's called a circuit breaker halt, and is allowed to be implemented when a stock moves in excess of about 5%. They just typically don't abuse the fuck out of it to spite traders and prevent MASSIVE LOSSES.   So what does this mean for how the market will move today, and possibly from now on?   Well. It's gonna suck. It will be choppy and halted ALL day, because there are no legal restrictions on abusing a cucircuit breaker halt. HOWEVER. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT SHORTS ARE CURRENTLY AT ~140%+ OF FLOAT.   Those shorts still need to cover. All the data I can find on the accurate report of short float is data from 12/31. Unless someone had better information I think everyone is using these figures. Well get updated info by Monday about how overextended these bastards are. So those shorts will probably get fucked next week if Friday doesn't deliver.   I'm relatively new to options trading so I don't really grasp the gamma squeeze, but apparently that's going down 1/29 as well.   All this to say. The industry is engaging in an absolutely fucking ridiculous amount of market manipulation to attempt  'm not sure exactly what. The shorts still HAVE to cover. options are still expiring tomorrow. Those are the key factors at play here and halting every minute for the next week won't change that.   They're fucked, and this is the tantrum before bed time.   GME $5000   (I am not a financial adviser this is all my opinion based on publicly available knowledge. I'm probably fucking wrong anyways. Don't listen to me bbrrrrr brrrrrrr)  Edit: positions- 2000 GME, 300 BNGO
CUSTOMER SUES ROBINHOOD!
According to NYT this is a foul-mouthed Reddit page. Really? The reporters mixed up Reddit with Facebook.
Because of us AMC Theaters now has a fighting chance!
AMC has offloaded $600 Million dollars in debt. In 2018, Silver Lake,¬† ¬†into AMC via a debt offering due in 2024, the firm converted its $600 million bond into AMC stock. The move will lighten AMC's debt load by $600 million. Apparently Silver Lake made "the trade of a lifetime thanks to the basement bandits."   Cheers to us basement bandits who saved the world's largest theatre chain.     That being said $GME is the priority! TO THE MOON
HELP FROM PORTUGAL IS COMING
ME AND A BUDDY OF MINE JUST BOUGHT 1 SHARE OF GME. LETS HOLD THESE FUCKING TRENCHES BOYS!!!!! WE ARE NOT PAPER HANDS!!!! WE GONNA FLY TO THE LIMITS OF FUCKING SPACE. CARL SAGAN WILL BE PROUD OF US!!!!!

Costing us degenerates mad tendies. Keep holding you fucking apes
YES WE'RE BACK BABY
so glad i bought more GME on the dip AND hold my previous shares :))) it's scary but be patient guys it's worth the wait
(@AOC) This is unacceptable. We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp ‚Äôs decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit. As a member of the Financial Services Cmte, I‚Äôd support a hearing if necessary.
While Robinhood and couples of other broker apps fuck with our freedom. Please share your resources here on how you can still buy them in America. It‚Äôs now our time! Screw you Wall Street.
Cnbc digging   else watching this winklevoss interview right now? The establishment is seething. Hold til the moon
Get em, AOC
TD Ameritrade still selling $GME

$GME feels like a good buy
Hi. Load up. We are gonna blast
Question from options noob about getting permissions in interactive brokers
To Trade options on interactive brokers they want you to say you have been trading options for 2 years. While I have traded stocks for 2 years I never traded options, but I studied a lot about it and feel confident now to get into it. Their policy basically means you are not supposed to ever be able to start trading options on their site without having traded 2 years on a different site which is absurd because if all sites did that nobody will be able to trade options ever. So I suspect they just do it to cover their asses legally and don't really care what I write in there.   My question is   how big of a risk you think it is to lie to Interactive Brokers about my options experience  . What do you think is the worst case scenario that can happen as a result of that. Losing all money in the account? getting banned? getting sued?  Thanks a bunch, Love you guys! Keep fighting! GME all the way!
In our darkest hour, look at the VW08 short squeeze graph and hold
Euroautist here. Now this is personal.
I was going to watch this circus to unveil from far far away, but the moment Robinhood and other US brockers blocked purchasing this stopped being about enjoyment. Its now about proving the opint. As soon as Revolut activates my account, I'm putting $2500 into GME. I won't cry if it's lost. It's not about money.
MOVE TO FIDELITY
LADS     Fidelity has had NO outage issues for me so far and has successfully price-matched and purchased $GME with no issues.     GET ON HERE, GET OFF YOUR YEE YEE ASS HOBINROOD     this is not financial advice
AMC is way down. ASAP buy buy buy. NEVER SELL
LETS FKING GOO, KEEP HOLDING!!!!
Boycott Robinhood
What Robinhood is doing today is completely illegal.  They are the reason that investors are getting hurt on the market today. After the dust settles on GME, BB, AMC, and NOK, we should boycott Robinhood‚Äôs platform.  It sounds like the majority of us in here have access to other financial services.  Robinhood no longer deserves our trust, nor do they deserve our money.
We're coming back up lads. ENGINES ON FULL.        NO SELL. ONLY HOLD
HOW DID I GET   PER SHARE? AM I FROM THE FUTURE?

Class action lawsuit against Robinhood
This is clear manipulation!  We should band together again, this time against Robinhood in a Class Action Suit for their manipulation of the markets through disallowing buying while allowing selling.   Loss porn? Let's cost robinhood Billions, make them think twice before ever doing this again!!  How many of you silly   are with me?!

THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED. WE ARE DOING THIS LIVE!
Looking for a (non-corrupt) broker in the EU, Netherlands specifically.
A lot of brokers seem to be part of the market manipulation, hiding stocks or only allowing people to sell. Is there a thread for good brokers and bad brokers? T212 is bad and etoro as well, heard DEGIRO is good but their website doesnt work rn.  Can someone tell me which brokers are good?
ITS SLOWLY RISING, DONT STOP AND HOLD!!!!
IT'S WORKING
BRITFAGS - MARKET IS BACK OPEN ON ETORO
