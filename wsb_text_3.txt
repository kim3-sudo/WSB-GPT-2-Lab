This is gonna be a long story about all the unfairness I observed and endured from the 1% both in corporate and the market. I'm sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.   Sorry for my bad English.   Hello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.  I got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)   So to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I'm 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.   Backstory:   I've always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.   So with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was "The market is rigged, don't join it". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.   So after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn't even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here's the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.   In the end, I couldn't find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could've helped my family.   Fast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can't use ACH because we're transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.   But after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.   Around that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.    The Beer Virus Crash:   I joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we're on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should've pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.   The corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I'm not starting again, I'm starting again with experience.   Sadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won't get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it's been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to "keep the image of the company". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it's much better to scapegoat one person than to say "We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything".   After all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don't have advance options and we also don't allow "legal" shorting here. But as we'll soon find out, it's only a rule for us commoners..   Basically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I've witness quite a few short ladder attack.    And since we don't have options, we don't have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them   You can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.   GME and the global movement:   And that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn't get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.   So now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.   A lot of people I know are asking to join and I've been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.   I look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that's a start.   So to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk. You have reinforcement from everywhere WSB. Even from places that cost 2 months wages for a share.   Let's make them pay for what they took from us and my brother tuition also! 10k per share is not a meme!!!   TLDR: Poor kid from 3rd world country holding GME because suits treated his family badly.  Position: Every penny in my name - 4 shares of GME  BUY AND HOLD GME!!! - This is not financial advices.  Edit: Oh wow this blew up much more than I expected. I've also received donation from many beautiful redditors on here. Thank you so much everyone, from the bottom of my heart!   Let's get them on Monday!
They are so petty they decided to lose 70B (and probably go bankrupt now) insted of just covering their positions
Buying the 50M shares, even at a whopping 1k/share (that was a crazy meme price when this all started) would have saved them ~20B (as of 30/01/2020)  But guess what? They are so confident about their untouchability, about the rigged game, about the casino, that they continued to double down.  And now they keep eating shit every day in order to save their 5 yacht.  Real investors don‚Äôt rig the game? Oh shit, must‚Äôve been a hedge fund then.  $GME 25 shares    üèª   (Not financial advice, don‚Äôt take anything I say as true, do your own research, I literally ate crayons for dinner)

I think all the donation/charity posts are short shills trying to convince others to spend money on gifts rather than GME
Seriously why not just spend that money on GME now, more than 10x it then donate 10 times MORE after the fucking squeeze?  And if that money was already in GME, then that means you just paper handed it   What's worse is that most of these donations are for fucking video games and not shit like water, shelter, or medicine  Kids can fucking survive without their GameStop products for a few weeks or months why the fuck are you donating now?  Clearly it's to create a snowball of goodwill and lovey dovey feel good bullshit to get people to spend money on charity rather than GME  It sounds crazy but think of ALL the other illegal shit they've done. Pay off big media, pay off Shitron, illegal short attacks, Robinhood, clearing houses
If $GME hits 1K Monday, I'm getting a   Ô∏è tattoo. Who's in?
I'm fucking in it with everyone. Not by much with 6 @ 222 but I'm not fucking selling any time until Wall Street shuts the fuck about their criminal/terrible investment.  Not going to lie, I'm hella excited about next week and watching them shit their pants this entire week with all the media hit pieces and disabling Robinhood further proves my theory that their pants are soaked with shit. Love it.   Anyways friends.   I'm going to get it if $GME hits 1K, who is in with me?!   $GME TSLA MODEL S  Ô∏è  Edit: And think about the small and local business we'll be supporting too, those that were shut down during the pandemic.

THIS IS NOW A TATTOO CONVENTION    Edit3: Why the fuck did I forget rockets?          by the way, I'm not a financial advisor, I just like tattoos and this stock in particular.  Edit4: Some people are saying it won't hit 1K Monday, fine.   I DON'T GIVE A FUCK! WHEN $GME CROSSES 1K THIS WEEK I'M HOLDING AND GETTING THE TATTOO  .  Better?  Edit5: Damn, this shit blew up. I love you guys. A note to the mods in case you try to ban me if I don't do it. I will do it. I will set the appointment and everything for proof. Just please don't ban during this historical moment. Because of Covid's bullshit I'm not sure when I could get in to a store in Oregon. And if there is anyone who can do this tattoo near Portland, I'LL GET IT THIS WEEK.  Edit6:   THE FRONT FUCKING PAGE OF R/WALLSTREETBETS? I LOVE YOU GUYS LIKE I LOVE THIS STOCK, TO INFINITY AND BEYOND. I CONTACTED AN ARTIST FOR AFTER JANUARY 5TH (VACAY FOR MOM'S BDAY) AND WILL UPDATE WHEN SHE GETS BACK TO ME  !!  Edit7: Btw, I have 2k to buy $GME pre-market come Monday morning.

Robinhood WEIRD SHT going on??
So, because RH is fking us over, I have been opening accounts on other platforms, including SoFi and WeBull. I have never used Plaid before, but apparently that's the how both Sofi and webull integrate your bank accounts for direct transfers these days.  Because I have a RH cash management account, and Plaid has RH listed as one of the bank options, I naturally wanted to transfer money out of RH through Plaid.  Apparently, I couldn't. I double and triple checked username/password. Through both Sofi and Webull, the plaid message goes "Couldn't connect yo your institution". Every other bank institution account worked, including Bofa, Chase, and some local credit union/banks. And I haved tried this numerous times over roughly the span of 12 hours.  Did not work in either Sofi or Webull.           SOO.... I am gonna try to move the cash as soon as possible, IF possible. Imagine this sht ass company keep fking us over and over.        EDIT: Someone is asking what;s the weird sht? god damn brain hello?  Unable to access your money in a special time like this? at least partially restricted access it would seem???? if that doesn't concern you, you are a dumb sht
Whales to Watch: Week of 2/1 üê≥ ü™ì
EDITOR NOTE  : YES. GME NOK AND AMC have incredibly strong volume still, followed by BB/BBY      10 BAGGER: NVAX    In the interest of consistency, and because everybody needs to be chipping in right now, here‚Äôs the scans that caught my eye today heading into next week. Mondays are my best days so Ill have way more then, EOD.  üê≥üßê  Overall, whales kept betting on tech to bounce back heavily  , in convincing style (signals that indicated the call blocks were more than just hedging). Image links are call blocks from each.   Intitial research is often with barchart, but I always check for confirmation with Unusual Whales         : until the bitter end today, people were feverishly pumping call blocks with puts aligning them. If tech bounces back, FB in particular is due for a rip after correcting post-earnings         : consistent bullish call volume all week. People thought they fished the bottom yesterday but got curbed by the blood red index day         : lots of sporadic call clusters like this. PENN gets most of the glory, but there are a lot of catalysts coming around state regulations soon. Load up some 2/26 and wait for the pop          : the bulls are buying calls heavily in anticipation of earnings. If you think you know what a good beat is, just wait for AMZN Christmas results     BONUS: sporadic FDX call orders have come in. After an oversell for FDX recently, AMZN sympathy is plausible based on orders.         : yes. I know INTC can be awful. But tons of pump since the ER. they have a new CEO everyone is excited about now, and look to have found a bottom. I like this.       Tech grab bag:      ZNGA PINS CRM SNAP FSLY   EDIT: I forgot AMD     All HEAVY volume and look great for ERs coming off this tech drubbing.   Very bullish call flow.    EDIT/UPDATE:   /u/lordofoptions has sold me on   SENS    Hope this gives you some confirmation bias or ideas to look into.    Inbox always open  : i was super busy this past week, but in light of recent crazy market/WSB events I will be checking frequently and am willing to bounce ideas, field questions.    TLDR: Buy tech calls, because whales richer than you are doing just that.   good luck. üê≥

THIS GUY IS FLYING A BANNER SAYING "SUCK MY NUTS ROBINHOOD"
Good Morning to Everyone Except Robinhood, courtesy of @KasparCMS on Twitter
CEO of JP Morgan Chase, US's biggest bank, got paid $31 million in "pandemic year" 2020. He has expressed "concern" about income and wealth inequality: also opposition to socialism. Big fan of capitalism. Smiles a lot. Billionaire.
Do not believe the hedgies when they say they've closed their positions. First half of January, short float % actually increased! We won't have a clear picture of what happened last Friday till the new numbers are released on Feb 9. Who wants to bet the short float numbers go even higher?

Light GME DD - how much money (and how many shares) the HFs/MMs lost yesterday on ITM 1/29 Calls because we held $320
Hello degenerates, I was interested to see how many shares changed hands and how much gain/loss 1/29 ITM calls created for buyers/sellers after GME closed at $  yesterday. I took Nasdaq data on OI (for the newbies, that's open interest - numbers of contracts out there in the market) for each strike ( .  Summary Table:     Current float is like   (  so that means if   shares get assigned, 18% of float will now change hands as a result.  Here's the data visualized if you're interested to see where waves of call buying happened (OI on left vertical axis, $ total Gain/Loss for call buyers/sellers on right):     Someone who's smarter than me tell us some insightful things related to this data. This isn't financial advice. Holding \~$20k b/t shares and 2/5 calls.      IF HE'S STILL IN THEN I'M STILL  IN

CNBC and other lapdog talking heads harp on us about fundamentals and exit strategies. Where were the fundamentals and exit strategies when the Hedge funds fucked themselves?
I just cannot believe these CNBC, Market Insider, and other lapdog corporate media idiots are actually going on TV and in print heming and hawing about the retail trader movement behind GME and our apparent ignorance of the GME fundamentals, our apparent ignorance of having an exit strategy.  Where the hell was this staunch worship of fundamentals when shorts were borrowing against gamestop to 140% in an effort to push the price down on an equity that quite literally reached a price to book ratio of   These fucking idiots harp on about fundamentals, but don't have anything to say about a hedge fund exposing itself 10x over to try and push a stock down further than literally less than it's liquidated cash/inventory value.  Similarly, where was this concern for an exit strategy when those same hedge fund shorts were sitting at huge profits? Why didn't they take profits? Where was this concern for an exit strategy when the stock turned a corner and new boardmembers were appointed? Where was the exit strategy when Melvin, Citron, Etc lost 100% of their position, or 200%, or 500%. Where was the exit strategy when they got bailed out for 2 billion and still doubled down on the position? Where was the exit strategy when they quite literally put our equity markets on the verge of a liquidity crisis?  These fucking hypocritical idiots love to throw these things around now that one of the worst trades in history went sideways on them. Where were all these values and disciplines when they made their idiotic trade? Why didn't their prime broker force an exit strategy on them? I sure as shit know my broker would have stepped in a lot sooner. Why didn't theirs? Did their idiotic broker not realize that in a functioning market they are ultimately the last buck and bagholders in this if Melvin becomes insolvent?  Everything about this from their idiotic trade to their response smells like total bullshit.     EDIT:  PS: I LIKE GME AND AMC AND IM NOT SELLING  My risk tolerance on this position is infinite. Collectively we have extremely diversified and pooled risk across literally millions of people throwing a few hundred or thousand bucks at the thing. The dumb fucks on the other side of this trade have miniscule risk tolerance, massive leverage, and extremely concentrated positions that risk entire hedge funds. No matter how much they try to convince us that we're in a dangerous position, the absolute worst thing that happens to us is we each lose some bullshit money in a diversified loss spread across literally millions of people. All of whom will sleep soundly at night knowing we fought a good fight. The idiots on the other side of this trade stand to lose their oligarchy. They stand to lose entire hedge funds on the behalf of other billionaires who were too lazy to read the prospectus of the hedge fund that just lost tons of their money. Make no mistake, we have the high ground. Both financially, and morally.

Defending Your Tendies From the SEC
This has nothing to do with share price, so if you don‚Äôt care about going to jail or losing all your tendies to a civil suit, scroll past this. This won't apply to most of you, but it probably applies to  some  of you.  Alright morons, listen up. Law student here who has grown fond of wsb through lurking for quite a while. There are some legal issues you need to be aware of if you are, or have been, making moves with GME/the other meme stocks right now. These issues range from civil to criminal, so you should probably read this. I‚Äôll put a TL;DR at the bottom if words are hard for you.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  First of all, I am  not  an attorney (yet), and you should not rely solely on this post to make any decisions at all.   You should talk to a real lawyer   if you think you might need legal advice. More on that below.  I‚Äôm going to provide some short summaries of cases along with an excerpt from a relevant legal journal that discuss some of the things I‚Äôve seen on wsb as of late, and if it sounds like you,   go talk to a lawyer.      "The opportunity to violate securities laws on the internet is not limited to issuers. Even common stockholders can opt to violate the securities laws by using the internet to manipulate the markets."¬†Christine Souhrada,¬†Securities Fraud, Market Manipulation, and the Internet, UCLA   & Tech., 2002, at Notes 28  What that means in tendie-speak is that the SEC can come after  you  for some combination of your posts, comments and trades. This doesn‚Äôt mean they  will , just that they  can.  Note: The SEC has an   and the memes are good, you're not immune from real-world problems.  The SEC is not the only source of potential problems. They coordinate with lots of federal and state agencies. I‚Äôm not going to explain the law & procedure of 50 different state law enforcement apparatuses to you, because i'm fond of you, but not  that  fond. Also, like I mentioned above, you can be civilly liable for behavior that doesn't rise to the level of criminal.  The key to what the SEC calls market manipulation is "causing enough investors to buy the target company's stock by disseminating   false information   to artificially inflate the stock price.  Id.  (See the above-referenced legal journal, that's what ' Id.'  means) This also applies to artificially deflating (by disseminating false information) if you hold a short position or a put, etc; this is the apparent business model of funds like Melvin, and yes, they should be the ones being looked at, but  should  doesn‚Äôt matter and I'm writing this for you, not them.  If you‚Äôve gotten caught up in the hype and memes, and have been disseminating false information in an effort to moon GME, you need to talk to a lawyer   now  . I can‚Äôt tell you if what you‚Äôve said is false or not, but a real lawyer can. The lynchpin of liability (tendie-speak: whether you have a problem on your hands) is the making of material misstatements or omissions to induce investors to purchase securities. See ¬ß17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, and ¬ß10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Here are some examples of people getting in to the crosshairs of the SEC via some of the above-described behavior:        v. Simmons  , 8:04-CV-2477-T-17MAP, 2008 WL 7935266 (  Fla. Apr. 25, 2008)  Stock promoter acted with severe recklessness in predicting that a company's stock prices would rise to at least  , yet selling his stock for a third of the price, which satisfied scienter element of the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. Therefore, promoter engaged in securities fraud. Despite claiming that he posted cautionary warnings to potential investors on his posts on a website and stating that the posts were based on his enthusiasm for the company's future prospects, there was no evidence submitted, besides seller's deposition testimony, that the postings were pre-qualified with a cautionary statement warning potential investors to consider.        v. Masri  , 523 F. Supp. 2d 361, 365‚Äì66 (  2007)  Defendants purchased 200,000 TZA shares on August 20, 1999, in order to push the price of TZA above $5, thus causing the TZA August 5 put options to expire worthless and avoid the required purchase of 860,000 shares at $5 per share  SDNY Court held that if an investor conducts an open-market¬†transaction with the intent of artificially affecting the price of the security, and not for any legitimate economic reason, it  can constitute¬†market manipulation.      ‚ÄúB-b-b-but I only relied on publicly available information!!11!‚Äù      Yeah, well, so did this guy:   Sec. & Exch. Comm'n v. Fiore  , 416 F. Supp. 3d 306 (  2019) Promoter's reliance on corporation's public filings did   not   allow him to get out of the action filed against him by the SEC.         ‚ÄúNothing I did moved prices, I‚Äôm too small!‚Äù     Still a potential problem.   FindWhat Inv'r Group v.    , 658   1282 (11th Cir. 2011) Finding that confirmatory information that wrongfully prolongs a period during which stock is traded at inflated prices, even without increasing the level of inflation, may be actionable under the¬†securities¬†laws; that is, defendants may be liable for knowingly and intentionally causing a stock price to remain inflated by preventing preexisting inflation from dissipating from the stock price.¬†Securities¬†Exchange Act of 1934, ¬ß 10(b),¬†15   ¬ß 78j(b)  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  Lastly, if, after all of this, you find yourself several orders of magnitude richer than you were at the start:   TELL NO ONE. TALK  TO A TRUSTS AND ESTATES ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY.   I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware of the issues that lotto winners find themselves dealing with. If you‚Äôve struck gold and are swimming in tendies, you are effectively a lotto winner, which means you are now a target. Even well-meaning people will try to help you spend your tendies. You need to retain counsel to figure out how you‚Äôre going to protect yourself from others.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  TL;DR: There is no tldr.   and that's all you're gonna get.

Robinhood shows why diamond hands superior, paper hands inferior
If Robinhood had simply kept their shit together and allowed the market to do their thing, their IPO timed after a massive success of market-fixing two or three vulture hedge funds would have made them the go to solution in the entire world.   Instead they were weak and failed, paper hands folding. Now everyone hates them and are abandoning the platform. Proof: everywhere.   I would not be surprised if the RH board and existing investors demand an exit of the entire C suite. If I were an investor there, given the media attention, you can damn well be sure those calls would be taking place and I‚Äôm a retard.  Lesson: don‚Äôt be Robinhood. Diamond hands.

Retards while SEC is monitoring WallStreetBets looking for evidence of market manipulation, but all they find is our shitposts and memes:
$NOK is almost certainly a plant. $GME is the most mechanically likely to squeeze, followed by $AMC and $BB
Sup retards, I rejoined to try and warn you all of the market crash last week thursday, and none of my posts and comments got through, not sure if this will either.   I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.  - High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into - It's not shorted much at all - People only started mentioning it  very  recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent. - Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past - The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news  But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed    (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal  :    Symbol   Allowed Share purchases   Allowed Option Purchases       -      $GME   1   5 (minimum of any of them)     $AMC   1   10     $BB   1   10      $NOK   5   10     Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.  Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.  I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here,   WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE  . We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.  [EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that  - $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze - $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table - $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds - $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)  Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.  This post exists to  dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes . If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They  MIGHT  gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them.  [EDIT 2] It looks like people are still confused about brokers. There are three brokers that I can recommend, if you're trying to express a view on this market:  - Fidelity - Vanguard - TD Ameritrade (   If you're thinking "You're a fucking plant, how could you recommend TD Ameritrade?", calm your tits. I have been posting since last week about the  actual  restrictions that are in on TD Ameritrade, fucking read them --   you  CAN  buy $GME and $GME calls on TD  . The media misreported and never actually listed what the restrictions were for TD (they were one of the first to restrict).  NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF TD WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, SO THE SAFEST ARE FIDELITY AND VANGUARD.  Also, I will shill for TD a bit -- when I dumped RH last year because they cost me money, I moved to TD and they forced me to do their education stuff on options and shares and futures before being approved for level 2 options (I'm not a fan of lying on my applications to financial institutions). I actually really fucking enjoyed it and learned a lot. I don't know how they're going to change since they merged with Chuck Schwab, and you could say that all their "education" schtick is actually just bullshit to convince you that you know what you're doing  before  you give the big boys your money, but I really like TD.  See my previous comments about TD's actual restrictions from when I called them, on the phone, like a boomer:  -   -   -   -   -    I posted multiple times for the same reason I made this post. If you still think I'm a plant I don't know what to tell you.  [EDIT 3] People have made me aware of more good news on the $NOK front, but everything I said before still stands, see the following comments with people putting me in my place on $NOK:  -   -   -

My psychological strategy to holding stock
Hello, everyone.   I really like stocks  . But everything didn't start out like that. Back in September when I made my first investment, I lost about $50 x 100 shares. Bought TSLA at 440 and sold out at 390 with paper hands and panic selling. Look at its stock price now.  After that, I vowed to myself I would never sell stock again. I needed a strategy. Something that would help me pull through psychologically and hold. At that time, as well, the NIO rocket ship was still boarding to the moon. I bought in at $27. Although the ship was mid-flight, something halted it at $49-$50. I was scared shitless. I thought that it was done for now. The increasing amount of stress I had, thinking about the stock price day in and day out (especially on weekends), began eating away at my mind. It was at that time that    I had suddenly began to jack off about 3 times a day    (it used to only be once a day). Once at the beginning of premarket, once at market open, and once at market closing (the intervals because of the refractory period... or... rest period, should I say). Without even realizing it, I had spent less time on trading charts and more time on \[awesome websites\] to optimize my "sessions". It was great. And before I knew it, I held right through to NIO day where, and now NIO stands at $57.  Holding can be beneficial. And there are multiple examples of such other than NIO and TSLA. And many other individuals in this subreddit can testify to that (DFV, SIR JACKALOT). Whether or not they utilized the same strategy as me, I'm not sure. Regardless, this outlines the importance of holding and what I did to hold. It might help some of you guys struggling to cope with the psychological pressure to sell.  I thought it was necessary to post this because of all the fear, uncertainty, doubt circulating in the market. And I thought that my strategy might help you hold the   stocks that you like.   Regardless, I hope all of you get to the moon with some crispy as heck tendies.

DD about Melvin closing their position
TLDR: Looks like Melvin did close their position, but it wouldn‚Äôt affect the squeeze.   DD:  I dug up Melvin SEC filing and saw that they have   GME shares put in Sep (an increase from   shares in June)   Most likely their short position is around the same or up to 7M in December, but I doubt they have a much larger position than that.   Melvin claimed that they covered their shorts on 01/27. GME‚Äôs price on 01/27 is ~$360, so it cost them about $2B to $  to cover. This matches the bail they got from Citadel. Also LB, one of Melvin‚Äôs top holdings had a violent dip on 01/27 - this could mean Melvin had to liquidate some other positions to cover. Melvin has another SEC Filing due Feb 14 for December, so we will have a better idea about their number.   S3 reports that short interest reduced by 5M shares   on 01/27. This matches with the shares Melvin covered.   This means there are still 58M shares that are not yet covered. What we are seeing in the last couple days are the tip of the iceberg, the squeeze will be much more violent in the next couple days if we      I don‚Äôt think that many of these are new short positions because: 1. Shares are incredibly hard to borrow at this moment 2. Hedge funds tend to target low risk high ROI stocks. This means easy/cheap to short shares with negative sentimental   Bottom line: hold on tight    because we‚Äôre gonna go for quite a ride   üåï My price target: $20k  Not a financial advice, just why I like the stock.

Afraid of RH fuckery with our GME shares. What do?
Given RH is well... RH... I don‚Äôt trust them to not black out or some shit during the short squeeze.   Long term the plan is to transfer my shit out of there, but I really don‚Äôt want my shares to be in transit while all this shit is happening.   Given all gains are short term gains anyway, do I fuck myself over on a tax/average cost basis?  Unless I was to hold all of them for over a year, I don‚Äôt think it would make any difference. Am I missing something?  To further reduce risk I was gonna sell in RH and rebuy on my other broker in chunks. That way any impact of a huge jump/dip are minimized.
An idea for us try and correct the narrative that the media has created around WSB. #WSBgivesback
If you haven‚Äôt noticed, the media has been trying to paint us in the harshest light possible while trying to humanize these criminal, fraudulent billionaires and hedge fund bros. It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. I‚Äôm willing to bet that we do more for people in need than any of these scumbag market manipulating fucks ever have. So I have an idea.   We have more than enough people in this sub to be an influence on the outside world. We need to do something that actually highlights the good we do for our communities and people in need. We should all take to Twitter and use some kind of hashtag like #WSBgivesback or something idk. And just talk about how some of us make a good effort to give back some of the profits we make when our trades give us those sweet sweet tendies. I‚Äôve noticed more people giving back with their profits from GME or AMC or whatever mooning stock is popular rn.   It‚Äôs hard for the media to control the narrative when we can very likely create some trend on Twitter for everyone to see. Since it‚Äôll be trending, it‚Äôs likely some of these media companies write pieces about it (because it‚Äôs a low hanging fruit story, ez clicks for them) and we start to actually change the narrative and have it resemble a bit more truth than what the people have been given so far.   Idk it‚Äôs just an idea, I love this community and seeing people give back some of their gains just makes me love it even more. Sure we all joke around, call each other retarded or gay bears amongst other things. But i think a majority of people here are good who want to make a positive change for those around them.   Also, KEEP BUYING, KEEP HOLDING, WE NEED TO CREATE SO MUCH FUCKING DAMAGE TO THESE HEDGE FUNDS THAT EVEN FUCKING FLEX TAPE CANT EVEN FIX THE COLOSSAL HOLE THAT HAS BEEN FOREVER BURNED IN THEIR FAT POCKETS.
This is how we true retards react to the hedgie bots' spam
Aussie here supporting the cause! GME and BB with another $10k ready for market open.    Strong together!
I‚Äôm buying more Monday..... GME to 42,000 per share. Might go below 100ps first thou so don‚Äôt be surprised.
Citadel bought GME?!?!
So as everyone knows, the Hedge Fund with the biggest short position on GME is Melvin Capital.  As we also know, Melvin got an emergency cash infusion of $  billion last Monday from Citadel and Point72 to help them with their GME shorts.   On a post the other day someone sent the following helpful  .  Did a search for GME and at the bottom of the Top 20 hedge funds that own GME is Citadel With   shares which is only .01% of their portfolio.  It says their position is new but believe this list is as of Q4 2020.  This is confusing me as this position contradicts their support of Melvin which may be going bankrupt if we have our way.  Unless they are holding to hedge the support of Citadel?   Any thoughts on this?  I want to see both Melvin and Citadel go bankrupt and hate to see one of them profit off GME mooning.  Does anyone have an updated list of hedge fund positions or a list of what stocks hedge funds are shorting?  TLDR, Why does Citadel have a long position in GME?  I don‚Äôt want to see them make a dime off of GME mooning.    F ck Melvin! F ck Citadel! F ck Shitron! F ck Robinhood!  They‚Äôve made this personal and I‚Äôm not selling till one of them goes bankrupt!  Hold the F ckin Line!
Don't waste your time with #SilverShortSqueeze
As others have said it's a distraction. I asked my uncle who works for a big diversified mining company and he said silver is produced along with other industrial metals such as zinc and copper. It's actually a by-product. The idea of a shortage has been around since the 70s. It's only the smaller bars that are getting hard to find.   Uranium on the other hand is facing a supply shortage, so there's your real nuclear option, but the market is too small.  Edit: $GME 4eva  Edit 2: Thanks for the awards!

I am just mad.
I am mad at the media. They keep calling everyone "reddit bros." They keep painting this sub in an image like we are criminals. CNBC are biggest morons of all. They are sellouts and hypocrites. Nobody should be watching or listening to them ever again. Fuck'em  I am mad at Vlad and Robinhood. I mean a lot of us already hated that App when it shutdown during the biggest trading day of the year in 2020. Right when the market was crashing too. It wasn't just one day, it was multiple days. Now we all know he is sleazy scum and I hope the company becomes insolvent.  I am mad at hedge funds and how they are connected to these brokers. This is a HUGE conflict of interest. Guess who else is connected to these cock gobblers? Janet Yellen. That boomer is part of the problem and received huge speaking fees from Citadel. Thankfully the Treasury and the SEC are two different entities. I wanna see people go to jail for clear manipulation.   I am mad that I can't be there with you guys holding GME and being part of the good fight. Here I am deployed in the middle east and I'm locked out of all my accounts due to 2FA. I know this may make me a hypocrite, but I am mad for the little guy. The retail investor who can never win. They tell us to invest but when we beat them at their own game, they cry, whine, and do shady shit.   I want to make them bleed. They are down $70 billion. I want them down another $70 billion.   I am proud of all of you. I am proud to be a part of this group. I am proud of the people who are sticking up for us like Papa Musk, Dr. Parik Patel, Dave Portnoy, and I can't believe I am saying this but congressmen and women. I'm proud that people are giving back. I proud of the billboards. I am proud of everyone who is outside of the US who also like this stock. Most of all I'm proud of DeepFuckingValue who saw this play almost 2 years ago. Lastly, I'm proud of the mods. Thank you.  Even if only 5 of you see this, thanks for listening.   TLDR: Don't sell.   Fucking  . Ruin them  Edit: This isnt meant to be political. I blanketed media across the whole spectrum, like all of you and your autism. I'm just mad and retarded.

When will r/wallstreetbets expand to global operations?
r/wallstreetbets should expand to global markets and start supporting other stock markets other than just Wall Street, like expansion to Chinese, Russian, European, London, Asian, and other global stock markets. Being restricted to Wall Street is not going to do much, and with how there are people across the globe who wants to get involved but can't due to stock market restrictions due to the hedge funds here, it would be nice to get involvement in other countries so they can join in. There are other stocks in other countries that are also potentially useful like GME in other countries as well.
Hold forever and you're not sending any message except that you are truly retarded.
Before you go  üí©on me, I'm not saying this is gonna implode and to get out now. I'm proud of you all for holding and the squeeze ain't squoze yet.  But everyone here that    should know you still need to have a price and sell when you get there. All the new people here seem sound like they are just gonna hold their 1 share of gme forever and they are never gonna sell. That they are doing this to send a message to wallstreet hedgefunds.   If you never sell, someone else will. You may not care about that, except for the fact that you're not going to send any message if they don't pay us! If you never sell and just want to bag hold and be part of the movement, that is some serious retard shit. You need to take that sweet squoze short juice.   If this is a "movement" or cult or whatever, about transferring wealth and making hedgefunds hurt, you are gonna eventually need sell and take their money. You don't have to set a limit order, some brokers or stock tracking apps let you set alerts. Set it and if it goes off login and sell that shit.  No one know how high it will or won't go. No one knows how long it will last or when it will start, the days to cover is probably higher now that volume has gone down.  Could it go to $69,420? I doubt it, but if it did I would be sitting on   dollars so that would be sweet.   I'm glad everyone has their    I just want everyone to walk away with their new fat stacks of hedge fund üí∞üí∞üí∞, and you're not doing shit if you are bag holding and they pull this shit back down to $10 or $20 after the squeeze.   Now go ahead and downvote me to Oblivion for the dose of reality you smooth brained Koolaid drinkers. I know you are all gonna call this FUD.   Tldr/ Stick it to the Man by making sure to sell when the squeezening happens.   I like the stock, not investment advice  102 shares @ $60

The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation
I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. "The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!", you say. I know, I know, but that's  . A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right.   I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.    Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb?   I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME   (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.  For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper   but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.  This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.  There are are   71 million shares   of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via  . Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.  Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~   Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.    GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the   had 295 shares fail to be delivered.  How many shares of GME failed to deliver?   1,787,191.   As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:     I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares.   No real shares can be found     and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.     TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.   Disclaimer: I'm just a starving engineering PhD student and I don't work in finance. I have no inside knowledge of how the financial system works and I may be wrong on some of this. This is not financial advice and you shouldn't trade based on it. I am book-smart but I still eat crayons like the rest of you. Obligatory rocket:           EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.  EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.  EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares:  . Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.  EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the "3 shares per wsb subscriber thing". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per "legit subscriber" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.  EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say "Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.  " We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.   This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.  EDIT 5:    EDIT 6: I am getting thousands of messages. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Here is an FAQ:  1.  How do I learn investing? I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read "the intelligent investor" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this. 2.  What is going to happen this week? I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess. 3.  Are you going to be killed? I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to "take down the shorts" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell. I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place.
Screenshot from Thursday. Still holding although they sold 11 of my calls. Currently holding: 471 shares at 143 ish, and 5 calls for end of Feb.       (50k YOLO last Monday)
Small TA on GME and why there is STRONG evidence of an upward spike. Just a retard sharing his opinon. BUY AND HOLD GME, it's NOT too late!
Hello degenerates,  I'm retarded and just looking for second opinions but...  Doing a quick TA on the GME chart from the past week and using a squeeze momentum indicator plus the basic RSI, I'd conclude:  1. Black crosses on the SQZMOM mean it's compressed. Looking at a previous cycle of compression, it was just when the price took off. I bought   so basically when it started. 2. The current compression is quite a big one, lasting a few days. The previous compression timeline looked at a pretty long sideways trend but the difference now is the spikes. It can't go sideways too long. But, if it's so compressed it means there is a pretty fucking huge possibility of having another run like we had from the 40 to the 480 range on the graph. 3. RSI seems to support this too. We are below the normal trendline of the past week. Last time it happened to move up, it was during the 40 to 480 spike. RSI seems to be moving up. 4. Volumes have been LOW as FUCK for obvious reasons (FUCK RH and the blatant manipulation). Hope you retards managed to get into good platforms so you can start buying. 5. The pattern usually warns of a big downward or upward movement of the stock. Based on the RSI and SQZMOM, it looks to be even stronger evidence of a huge spike.  I'm 110% sure there are much better, more knowledgeable people out here. I don't think I'm good or bad. I'd love to hear second opinions here and if what I say is complete shit I will delete the post so people won't be misinformed. Or I'll try to update it if it is possible.  Also, sorry if the flair is incorrect or something.  Post may be too short for DD.     TLDR;  Hope you bought the last dip because next stop is the fucking moon.  If you didn't buy yet, there's nothing wrong with hopping on while we ride parabolically. You think 10-20% gains on a single day is bad? Fuck no.  What about 100%+?  WHAT ABOUT 1000%?  Don't miss out and don't paper hand like most did during this run. Are you that dumb to miss out on a historic moment? Can't you make money OFF ONE OF THE BIGGEST RUNS IN A SINGLE STOCK?

Can someone please inform me what the current short interest % is for AMC?  I've found  .  Is it all bullshit and no one really knows until that info is released end of month?

It is awesome this sub is growing so fast, 7mm, wow. But let's not lose sight of what this sub is.
I understand that things change and yada yada but a major part of this sub is making risky trades with insane upside and total downside.  It is great youre joining but if this turns into another "everything has to be PC" sub then where else can I go to get my daily dose of front page -80k losses or 100k wins?  Just seeing some of these posts are kind of bothering me because it isnt at all what wsb is.  I want a fucking yacht. Simple.  I'm holding gme like the rest and I watched that -70% day and bought fucking more. I'm all with everyone on this as it is important to do.  But some of these posts making front page arent really wsb material. Like I just read one where a guy basically explains dfv personality traits and says how awesome he is. Like wtf? Yeah thats cool, I like the guy too but why in the fuck is that on the front page or even written at all?  Or another one about someone meeting another wsb user at an airport? Why in the fuck is this on the front page?  I like the wholesome wsb where people donate to charities and all that, love that shit. But for fucks sake, posts like those other two don't really belong and I hope we don't become another sub where everyone is a fucking pussy who down votes anything that isnt entirely pc or apology culture.  I want a fucking yacht.   EDIT: fucking retards lmao     üêÇüêÇüêÇ         EDIT 2: there's sort of a mutual respect here because we all fucking lose a lot lmao. When you see someone down 20k on a trade and his portfolio is now only worth 127 bucks, coming here we all make each other feel better with our bullshit lol. Like I would call this guy fucking retarded and he would likely laugh and think "yeah... why did I think gourds would fucking take off? I am retarded." This part of wsb is what kept this community so strong before the massive influx. We all understand the fucking game and we all empathize yet still bust each other's balls on this shit.  EDIT 3: Those who keep commenting mm=millimeters. I immediately know you've never seen a balance sheet in your life lmao.
$GME TO THE MOON
I've been trading Silver futures August. Don't fall for their shit by listening to your doomer uncle finally
Background: I've been trading silver futures since August which makes me essentially the expert. I joke but not really.  SILVER: the world's fakest precious commodity. As we are poor people here most of us grew up with the perception that silver has value due to its scarcity. No longer is this the case. Base usage statistics state that about 70% of it is used in the industrial manufacturing sector.  Countries hold many tons of reserves. Just Google silver reserves and understand Peru is sitting on a many year stockpile if all of the aggregate demand suddenly decided to only buy from Peru.  As price rises poor countries will inevitably sell off reserves and there is a strong suspicion has been occurring as silver is up big time this year and tax revenues for all nations are down.  So the ETF SLV is a complete crock of shit. End of week I figure out the max pain option price and just sell a call/put based on it as SLV is determined by the futures price, which is heavily controlled through a large amount of paper contracts on both sides of buy/sell that'll never materialize.  If you go through my post history you'll see me shorting silver this summer and while very profitable, I did blow a bunch per wsb lifestyle, but my day to day futures trading gave me tremendous feel for the pulse of it. End of week is beyond manipulated and while I do not have the software to do so; if you threw it in on your computer to short/long slv/silver futures towards its equivalent SLV max pain price (with the caveat of factoring in only the most recent 30 days max pain which is tough to generate except through watching OI/volumes fluctuate) you'd join in on the JPMorgan train as they're the ones doing it. I'd actually argue instead of taking a buy and hold approach to just do exactly that by end of day Thursday as JPMorgan acts like a crooked circus game operator with "wild" Friday swings towards max pain or lack of expected shifts (that then materialize monday) so every person who plays their game for them is one less cent they can't make. My theory is with the etf they've sort of become a traditional bank with their reserve (silver) being turned into a cash generating enterprise via the selling of premium. I estimated they were raking about 10 mil of premium a week and while certainly not earning it all via some expiring itm vs their non covered positions, the amount they do is a healthy and lucrative business when there is no major risk to the underlying when you rig the game and have all of the cards.  Futures are better as you are greater leveraged and can buy after hours. GME after 5pm (edt) Friday moved generally like silver does from 6pm-8pm which I find highly interesting given this now attempt to get us to take our eyes off the target and to rely on many years old articles that are now materially false if you were to Google out this theory.  Long term prognosis is as always - whatever the man says to do in the retail arena, means they want you to hold their bags so at a minimum please disregard.  Tl;Dr hold/buy gme and walk away from the computer, do not buy silver of any variety except to jump in on the manipulation as it trades very predictably particular towards Friday when SLV options expire and triple so when the monthly variety are what's expiring, mods are /

Let‚Äôs get a sequel going
GME: the case for a value play
This is not financial advice, just an attempt to explain the real story of what happened before the pile-on started     There‚Äôs a huge misleading narrative that WSB ‚Äúpicked‚Äù GME because of its short interest and that‚Äôs the only reason the short squeeze is on.  Here‚Äôs the thing...  WSB hated on the GME DDs! The pile on happened after the initial squeeze began...  #This was always going to happen  Let‚Äôs start at the beginning.  GME was shorted at 171% at   To use DFV‚Äôs words: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a seriously ballsy bet!‚Äù  GME was never going bankrupt in 2021. Here‚Äôs why:  ##1) Console cycle   Historically, GME stock price jumps significantly when new consoles come out. This can be observed easily.  The shorts were aware of this, but bet that it wouldn‚Äôt happen again because new consoles wouldn‚Äôt have optical discs.   They were wrong...   There‚Äôs plenty of support for this thesis by real analytics investors. I give you Micheal Burry - of Big Short fame. He went in at &lt;5 because of the above console cycle.  He later said GME was a value play at 20-60, a short play at 80. The reason it isn‚Äôt a short play now is because of later events.  ##2)  Financial Heath  This one is simple. Mid COVID, with terrible stock prices, GME bought back 7-800 million of debt.  This is simply not something a company going bankrupt does. If they were going bankrupt they‚Äôd focus their efforts on survival and bank on discharging the debt in bankruptcy court if it hit that level.  For the record, this fact is what got me into the play thanks to Uberkikz. Buying back debt is not the action of a company dying in the next 12 months.  ##3) Ryan Cohen and digital gold  For those of you who don‚Äôt understand the times we live in, user data is literal gold when used properly. Ryan Cohen knows this.   Let‚Äôs talk about who he is:   He wanted to found an e-commerce pet food franchise based on customer loyalty. He was laughed out of investment meetings based on the market being dominated by giants with established market and low prices.  He said that even in the age of dirt cheap virtual flea markets there was a gap to be filled via customer-centric e-commerce. He was correct. He built Chewy up and only sold it because his grandfather got sick.  RC wrote a letter to GME saying they could accelerate their shift and utilize the unique data they have on three generations of gamers to capture a market that is growing by leaps and bounds daily.  When I was looking for recovery plays, i eyed up AMC (lol), but didn‚Äôt bite. DFV and Uberkikz convinced me and I bought in.  Then Ryan Cohen upped his stake... Then he hired an activist lawyer specializing in takeovers.... Then they PUT HIM ON THE FUCKING BOARD  Now he has 3 seats and two friendly votes.  Here‚Äôs the thing, yes Reddit piled on but that‚Äôs because at this point they were sold. The thing they‚Äôd been ignoring as dumb now had proof.  GME was becoming a tech company and tech companies are forward valued thanks to our bubble, look at Tesla!  This wasn‚Äôt a planned attack!!   ## As soon as RC joined the board, the shorts should have covered  They made a bad bet! When Dr Wilson in the 90s realized his short of the casinos went bad, he sent a telegram saying ‚Äúcover all shares‚Äù  Instead, they dug in and endangered everything with their over-leveraged bet ( not gonna get into share loaning and over-shorting but best believe there‚Äôs something fucked there).  Reddit piled on because the bull case was clear and the shorts were in the wrong.  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with investing on an opinion.  My opinion is that they‚Äôve helped GMEs turnaround by making this news and it‚Äôs a foregone conclusion.  Thanks for attending my TED talk. Stop the fuck the billionaires narrative,   this is a story about shorts making a bad bet against an unlikely value play.... period    Edit2: i realized I got lost in explaining the value play and forgot the point. I‚Äôm trying to point out that before the pile-on there was a valid bull thesis.  Once Ryan Cohen was put on the board, the internet flocked to this and everything went crazy, but I am seeing people on the news saying that ‚Äúwe all got in to fuck the billionaires‚Äù and that is just patently untrue.  I got in because at  , GME was worth more. Now it‚Äôs being squeezed so I have no idea where this lands.          Edit: as requested, my positions:  300 shares originally, got fucked down to 200 by attempting to day trade them right as my broker restricted buys. 50 shares at 14, 250 at 200  options at 14c, 16c, 30c all bought at GME price 14-15, pre earnings from hell: I sold these because I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been in since October and this was more money then I‚Äôve ever had.  I hold my shares until the end!
GME Short Squeeze (Jimmy Neutron)
$SLV is dumb
If you really want too make a difference In the silver market and our currency In general, make a futures trading account somewhere, buy the silver future and then take delivery on that future (simaler to "exercising your option").   It is a long process involving paperwork but  In order to skyrocket the price of actual silver you have too force the comex too buy more silver and slv isn't going too take delivery on anything as long as the naked shorts are In controll and the dollar is more powerfull.  ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ This action if done on a large enough scale will throw such a wrench In the works that you might not even care if you had ton of gold because you will be much more concerned about the bomb sirens and gunfire you hear too worry much about it. Either that or we will see a seamless transfer to the new global fiat, block chain based digital currency, which won't last long either. ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ‚òÑ   I, until the recent developments with Gme   was waiting for silver to drop much lower ($17 level) before buying physical; I am still waiting for a sharp drop, but have become much more tentative In my thesis due too the implications of what's going on. I do believe that they were able to gather enough ductape and spitwads on thursday too keep fiat In tact for now.  TLDR: The only way to blow up the silver market is to take delivery on  futures contracts and force the comex too buy large amounts of silver on the open market.  Edit: I know we're all pretty broke so suggesting emptying out the comex is quite a stretch but with the amount of money I've seen some of you making I'm sure you could afford a $100 face bag of 90% just too get the ball rolling. For the record I'm not buying at these prices but like I said I'm tentative, and either way one day $27  will seem like an absolute steal.   Edit 2: I learned something from one of the commenters that I assumed was a total falsehood. Apparently it's really difficult to find a broker that will help a retail trader take delivery. üòï oh well, if you know of one, leave it In the comments please.

Thinking we should have a stress / mental health / support thread to keep our    as    as fuck
Anybody else stressed out as fuck.  Even on the weekend i'm checking my phone to look at that piece of shit app Robinhood I'm unfortunate enough to have all my $GME stock in.   I think it's important to remember to keep your head straight during this time.  Many people here have probably never felt the fear & stress of having so much on the line.   Even though I've been 'responsible' in that even if i lose everything I've put into GME / BB so far goes to shit I will be ok, it's still pretty stressful.  I can't imagine what some of you must be going through who truly put everything they have into this.  And with some of you guys with millions of dollars on the line.  Fuckin crazy shit  Please share your thoughts on how you manage your stress, and how you can make sure to stay determined to keep your     .  Fucking Robinhood restricting GME last week really makes me paranoid as fuck that they will just shut down the whole app at the moment of reckoning, and everyone will just miss the whole boat when GME truly moons.  And when they turn it back on we'll be the ones left holding the bag.     But, my recommendation is to think about yourself when you're an old man/woman. In 50 years when i look back on this time, I know I would regret selling too early way more than selling too late.  So for that reason I know i'm holding all the way to zero if i have to.   Share your thoughts on how you keep your head straight and determined to HOLD TO THE MOON    TLDR : Talk about how you keep your    so we can       GME

Ally Invest Locked my Account from trading! INCOMING DIRTY TRICKS
Warning to all and looking for some help.  First, I have yet to receive my GME shares from my ITM GME JAN 29 Calls. I called earlier today and  the representative said that they could see the shares from Apex, but that Ally was experiencing a system problem in getting them to my account. They also said that they couldn't guarantee that my GME shares would be available on Monday.  Now, I went to Ally this evening to set a sell limit for my other GME shares to $69,420, but I received an error message that said my account was disabled from trading. I am sitting on the phone waiting for a representative now.  Is anyone else experiencing this?  Also, this could be their next tactic, "system issues" that prevent us from trading. Be on the look out.     Edit 1: Sat on hold for an hour, no answer. I will call back in the morning and update here.  Edit 2: Just got off the phone with Ally (recorded the call). They first said that my account was down because of a system update that they were pushing through today. Then I told him that my wife's account was working fine, and he went silent. He then went to check on something and said that it was because of the GME call options. Because the shares were still not assigned my account had been frozen so that I "didn't over draw the account". I told him that was bogus because I have plenty of capital and margin to cover the purchase of the call. He went silent. He said that the shares from the call would be available later today and that the update should be complete by noon. I told him that if they can't get my account up so that I can trade in what will likely be an incredibly volatile day, they are looking at a lawsuit. He said "yup"  This is what I think their next tactic will be. I will check my account later today to see if anything has change.  Edit 3:   petition to sue Ally  shared by u/Angry_Dolphin334.
Your broker restricted trading, and the short‚Äôs broker may too when $GME squeezes
First, you really should    No, really, go read it.   But if you don‚Äôt have time, here‚Äôs the important bit:  The DTCC is practically the insurance of the entire stock market. They set a fee for every trade as collateral (for buyers) and return it when the funds clear. Trade funds take 2 days to clear.  All trades go through clearing houses. They facilitate trades from brokers ( like your favorite trading app )  Let‚Äôs say the upfront fee is 1% for a certain stock. When a $1mil buy order through clearing house A happens, clearing-house A immediately gives $10,000 to DTCC, and starts a wire of $1million to fund clearing-house B (sellers) Once the wire of $1mil from A-B clears, DTCC gives the $10,000 back to clearing house A.   If it doesn‚Äôt clear because Clearing house A doesn‚Äôt have enough funds, the DTCC is stuck footing the bill to the sellers at Clearing house B.   If the DTCC runs out of cash and goes down, the market goes down with it   Now, due to the extreme volatility of meme stocks and their potential to skyrocket through the moon and beyond, the DTCC set the collateral fee to 100%, as if the price goes too high  even  the DTCC may not be able to foot the bill. This collateral-hike meant brokers such as ‚Äúthe trading app that shall not be named‚Äù had to send the DTCC an unprecedented   100%   of the value of buy orders   AND   begin a money wire of the buy order to the sellers of the stock. So, in total, that‚Äôs a  cool    200%   of every $GME buy transaction made. And so, put simply, some clearing houses did not have the sufficient funds to fulfill buy orders of $GME    But     what     if     this     happens     to     the     brokers     of     Melvin     and     other     short     sellers?    When the price of $GME goes high enough, the short-sellers‚Äô broker  may  (idk I just learned how to read,  this is not financial advice ) not be able to cover the   100%   collateral per trade. This   could   see a rather slow squeeze as shorts can only cover a small amount per day.   This may cause the price go up incrementally day after day, but only if we   hold    What do we do then?   WE HOLD         We   HOLD UNTIL THEY DO THEIR COVERING    $10,000 is   not a meme    I‚Äôm not a financial professional. Please correct me if I‚Äôve gotten anything wrong.   Obligatory              Edit: Why is the DTCC fee even a thing? Some other people asked this question too, so they created blo- redacted due to rules  Repost due to mentioning  redacted

Amid the enthusiasm, there is a dangerous misconception forming that needs to be quashed.
I've seen a lot of people on social media and the news spreading the idea that this whole thing was somehow masterminded by /u/DeepFuckingValue within the past 3 weeks. It wasn't and this is some dangerous misinformation as it needlessly makes /u/DFV a target. DFV is simply an eagle-eyed investor who bought into his GME positions quite a while ago, even before anyone here cared about GameStop's fundamentals or the remote possibility of a squeeze. He isn't some mischievous troll who decided sometime in early January to rally all of us into a stock-buying frenzy in order to stick it to some villainous wall street firm, nor did he ever make any special effort to promote GME in order to incite a squeeze. A large number of users here had known of the outsized short interest for a while so this entire thing was the organic result of increasing GME discussion.  /u/DeepFuckingValue is basically that guy that shows up to the party at 5 PM..... on the day before.     EDIT:      GME         üåñ
Potential Endgame Scenario: GameStop issues SOME shares and negotiates the best price on our behalf.
So this started with me being worried that GameStop would issue shares to Melvin at a price of their choosing and walk away with billions, leaving us holding the bag (or at least prevent the short squeeze). But that's just the thing: While they DO want to use this opportunity to better capitalize, they DON'T want to piss us off after what is currently happening to Robinhood. IPO? Nope. Solvency? We'll see. So how does Gamestop take advantage of this spike in share price while simultaneously not pissing off an angry mob of retards who have already been fucked repeatedly?  Here's my idea: If the short interest is 120% of shares, Gamestop issues an amount of shares representing ONLY that additional "20%". And you may say "Why negotiate a price?" Because GameStop has a legal responsibility to negotiate the best possible price for the organization and its shareholders (many of us included). So they could issue 12 millionish shares at $2500/share ($30 billion to the books), while allowing all of us to realize those same gains.  "But what about the squeeze?". That's the benefit of having a publicly traded company doing the negotiations, all kinds of financial models will be used to determine what the price of the squeeze, future interest, etc. would have cost, and it would be factored into the negotiated price.  Thoughts? Holes? Additions?  Position: 16 shares GME, diamond handed.  Edit: I'm being told my example of "20%" is way too high for what Gamestop is actually able to issue. If anyone is able to explain why they couldn't get more authorized, or what the maximum value they COULD issue is, I'll update.         My bad, typed it on desktop.  Edit 2: General responses have been, outside of me being a    corporate shill, that GameStop can only issue $100m worth of shares now, which would barely dilute it and may actually help drive up the price more. The other point is that they can technically issue up to 240m more shares, but it would take weeks to move through the process to authorize more. Would appear my concerns are unwarranted in the short term.

Identifying the SI left in $GME
Hello, your fellow retard who knows literally nothing about trading here.  I was checking out GME on TDA's ToS platform. When I go under the options section, you have the ability to check out options at all the major dates and can change the data you are able to see. I am able to see ' ', which if I'm not mistaken are all of the options open everywhere, aggregated for me to see aren't they? So can I not add up all of these open interests for strikes and get the total contract amount for puts and figure out how many shares are left on the short side and when they would be needed?  Also I know you are able to rollback shorts but how expensive is it to roll them back and for how long? 1/29 had more open interest contracts than any other date so it's likely the date that they're most likely to roll them back on if they think they're going to be able to shake GME holders. Do these open interest contracts then appear next week on 2/5 expiry date?  Thanks for the help R tards  Edit: the first thing I said is I know fucking nothing you god damn retards. Thanks :)  Edit 2: fuck I told you guys I was retarded, question is answered thanks. Puts and shorts are different I get it
If Melvin & Citron actually closed their short positions on $GME, who the hell is being bought against?
I know there is a lot of smoke and mirrors and NO I don't believe they covered their shorts. But, for the sake of an argument let's say they might have. Who in their right mind is keeping their position since there is still roughly 113% of the float shorted. So my questions are as follows:  1. Are retail investors at a point where they are shorting themselves? This answer I know is No. I've never seen such comradery in my life. My own family would have sold at $6 after making a $1 profit even if it was for the greater good.  2. What other institutions/hedge funds were short on this pig?  3. Did these morons double and triple down, sold their other positions and get more liquidity infused by their daddies (Steve Cohen, etc.)?  What an amazing time to be alive fellas.
Any napkin math on the Hedge funds?
Have anyone looked at the recent double down on shorts from the Head fuc.. Head funders?  What will it cost them to try and stay alive and hope for the price to go down when the squeeze is not happening? The interest must be sky high to hold these shorts.  Is it even possible for them to hold longer then a few weeks?  Also, people need to understand that they will try to lower the price every day but as long as we all collectively keep holding even if they manage to stay alive by dumping the price they still dont own any shares and will pay heavily for keeping their new shorts. So keep holding!

What‚Äôs the best way to transfer brokers?
I‚Äôm currently using Robinhood (fuck) and have been doing so since March as I first began my journey as a Professional Autist. I just opened a fidelity account, and I‚Äôve of heard a lot of people having issues with transferring. What‚Äôs the best way to transfer everything so that Robinhood doesn‚Äôt fuck me like my wife‚Äôs boyfriend does? My portfolio is only worth like 5k, so I was thinking about just liquidating my positions, transferring my funds to my bank account, and then depositing it in fidelity.  Edit: does RH really lock your shit down if you try to transfer?
GME IS THE ONLY STOCK IN THE WORLD THAT MATTERS
DISCLAIMER FOR THE SEC INTERNS: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I JUST FUCKING LOVE THIS STOCK.    HEY RETARDS, STOP BUYING AMC, BB, NOK, SLV, OR LITERALLY ANYTHING BESIDES GME. THE MEDIA AND HEDGE FUNDS ARE TRYING TO DISTRACT YOU FROM THE FACT THAT GME IS THE ONLY STOCK THAT MATTERS.   LITERALLY ANY OTHER STOCK ON THE MARKET THAT IS NOT GME IS A DISTRACTION.     THIS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME GOLDEN FUCKING TICKET TO u/deepfuckingvalue's TENDIE FACTORY.  $1,000 IS A JOKE. $10,000 IS CONSERVATIVE. $100,000 IS POSSIBLE IF WE STOP BUYING INTO THEIR BULLSHIT AND HOLD THE FUCKING LINE.   I LOVE YOU ALL, BUT SOME OF YOU ARE NAIVE AND OBLIVIOUS AS FUCK.  MAKE THEM SUFFER FOR ALL OF THE BULLSHIT THEY'VE PULLED ON US OVER THE YEARS.   CONSIDER THIS TO BE FORCED REPARATIONS PAYMENTS FOR 2008.   FUCK THE SUITS. POWER TO THE PLAYERS.   Positions: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK? ALL IN GME       EDIT: Thank you to all of the brilliant economists in the comments for letting me know that $100,000 per share would crumble the global financial system. No shit. It's obviously not going to happen, but in theory it could. If literally every single person held, the hedge funds' prime lenders would have to liquidate everything and pay us whatever ransom we want.     FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO WEAR HELMETS IN THEIR CARS: The point is that we are in control, NOT that you're going to make $100,000 per share.    EDIT 2: Holy shit it's worse than I thought. If you can't afford GME, respect. Buy some AMC and fuck the suits that way--but for the people who can afford to choose,   GME IS THE ONLY ONE WITH A SHORT INTEREST WAY ABOVE 100%.   I like AMC, BB, and NOK, too, but I really don't think you guys understand the GME situation. We caught the bastards who have been fucking us our whole lives with their pants down. They have shorted more shares than exist. We own the shares. BUT THIS IS ONLY TRUE OF GME. (Yes I know AMC has a huge short interest too, but GME is on a whole different level.)

Why all this matters - my GME story and how the system used me
This is my story of how companies like Robinhood take advantage of the fact that individually we are weak.  I am a small time investor and member of the WSB community and I like to support even though my pockets aren't that deep. Since I am from the EU I use Etoro because we don't have Robinhood.  On 29/12/20 I bought a small amount of shares (  in $GME with plans on holding for as long as I could.  My portfolio is really small but I do have one leveraged position at x2 for just a couple hundred with no money in my bankroll since all my money is in open trades.  On 08/01/21 the day of a big dip in my leveraged position I receive an email from Etoro giving me only a couple hours notice before they close my position at a loss which I didn't want to take:  "Due to extreme market volatility in the markets, margin positions for all leveraged positions is increasing to 100 percent. This applies to both CFD and real leveraged positions.  If you do not increase the margin to 100 percent then the position will be closed at 21:00 GMT today (Friday January 8, 2021). The invested amounts in these positions, together with any profit or loss incurred, will be returned to your account balance."  Basically, I had been in profit along with many others and they decided this dip was their chance to cut some losses and force out the small guys, taking profits for themselves.  Sadly I didn't have enough to cover in my bank account so I had to sell off my entire portfolio in order to stop them from closing my leveraged trade, selling out stocks I owned like $GME at a loss in order to prevent an even bigger one.  They tell us what we can and cant do with our own money, they tell us we can play the game but really they make up the rules as they go so they always win.  It makes me proud that so many of you were able to hold out against the illegal practices of companies like Robinhood and Etoro.  I liked the stock, but they forced me to sell.  Proof of $GME closure:    Email from Etoro:
Possible GME risks
We know about the short ladder attacks, we know that the extreme dips aren‚Äôt people selling...  But what‚Äôs to say that every time it dipped heavily ($112 Thursday, low $200s Friday) that the shorts are exiting their positions? The ‚Äú120%‚Äù short float we keep seeing thrown around without any sources comes out to ~80 million shares short, and the volume the past week is more than enough to have exited their initial short positions and reenter at ATHs in the $400s  Looking for serious discussion, please don‚Äôt follow herd mentality and just spam HOLDDDDDDD and maybe we can arrive at some conclusions that will mitigate risk for the new WSBers that entered this play late
Kiwi here. Sold 15 of my hobbits to support the cause
Why $AMC over $BBBY?
First of all let me pay my respects to the king $GME. Now that $GME is on the verge of squeezing it appears that $AMC has been anointed as $GME's little brother. This is a mistake because $AMC is diluting via debt to equity swaps and other forms of dilution. $AMC did a 600m debt to equity swap from silverlake this week and I believe they will sell more shares into the market this week or next week to deal with their debt load and lack of cash flow. $AMC is going to take this opportunity to de-lever and avoid bankruptcy. As more $AMC shares are created the squeeze will end.      $BBBY is more similar to $GME and it was Michael Burry's second biggest holding behind $GME. $BBBY and $GME both have cash on their balance sheet, generate free cash flow, and have their debt under control. $BBBY is buying back between 5-10% of their shares through February 27th and will not sell shares into the market. I think some retards are mistaking $BB for $BBBY. Blackberry has a low short interest and will not squeeze but Bed Bath and Beyond is the the 2nd or 3rd most shorted company behind $GME. Melvin is short $GME and $BBBY but not Blackberry. When Melvin is finally defeated he will have to close out his $BBBY position alongside his $GME position. We can inflict maximum pain on Melvin by raising the cost to borrow $BBBY shares but this tactic will not work with $AMC or $BB shares.     $GME is the best choice but the most effective way to crush Melvin and get bonus tendies is $BBBY not $AMC     tl;dr $GME $2000 $BBBY $250 $AMC dilution (no tendies)

Great News for this Silver Explorer $MXR That Could Rip with The Impending Silver Squeeze!
It's not just $SLV and others you can invest in, but also junior explorers searching for silver deposits. These ones tend to have a lot of upside compared to the risk at these lower market caps. Below is a recent NR describing how they just increased their land package for their copper-silver property:

TAAT - Will this be the new GME successor?
As some of you may know, Keith Gill, the 34 year old guy known as "DeepF-ingValue" from this forum was the driving force behing GME (1750% in 8 days!) who made the hedge fund owners despair and firmly ruined them.  After the GME story and Gill, we can take a closer look to his notes:        If you zoom in on the picture, we find TAAT on the top of the list on the ticker symbols. TAAT is the specific or / TOBAF US symbol for the stock TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (NYSE: A2P6PR)        Probably not only I will zoom in on Keith Gill's list and check that TAAT stock. This information will surely make the rounds quickly. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the company published fantastic news shortly after the market closed before this weekend.  I did my own research (DYOR! anyway) but I think that TAAT has the tools to become a "disruptor". A company that can fundamentally change an entire industry, just as Tesla did in the automotive market and Beyond Meat in the food market.  They invented a cigarette that is used completely without tobacco and without nicotine, but should taste like a real cigarette. Market entry is not years away as some will be possible know: No, already rolled out in the state of Ohio.  Are Tesla and Beyon Meat correctly valued on the stock exchange per today? That can certainly be discussed. What is certain, however, is that they have the advantage of being the "first mover" in their sectors and they have changed them forever. Also at TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. I see this entry into the billion dollar tobacco industry. Therefore the statement from the CEO of TAAT ( SETTI COSCARELLA ) is by no means a pipe dream for us:  >"Anything under a 5 million dollar market value for TAAT would be a disappointment to me!"  If Tesla or Beyond Meat have too few similarities to TAAT ‚Ñ¢, there is a very good example from this industry. Recently there was an IPO on the NYSE of a company with the relatively unimaginative name of RLX Technology Inc. (NYSE: RLX). The company develops and sells e-cigarettes and related products in China. The company will make about 160 million USD in profit in 2020, that's about 10 cents per share, which in turn results in a crisp P / E ratio of around 250!  Don't you also believe that the tobacco-free and therefore nicotine-free cigarette such as the TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (WKN: A2P6PR) manufactures in a patent-pending process, could possibly be far more successful than a vile e-cigarette? If so, then one should use the P / E ratio of 250 to determine the value of TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (WKN: A2P6PR) and can definitely consider this information. Only 10 million annual profits would justify a market value of   billion, which corresponds to a share price of almost 30 dollars and has moon potential. Sounds crazy, but it's true.  Check also this Breaking news:    TAAT announces that approximately 60% of retailers who have sold TAAT ‚Ñ¢ for three weeks or more have reordered at least once, with multiple reorders requesting greater quantities than the first time. TAAT ‚Ñ¢ has been placed in around   of all convenience stores and gas stations in the state of Ohio.  The management of several tobacco dealers indicated that there is a   of regular customers requesting TAAT ‚Ñ¢ by name.  During the second month that TAAT ‚Ñ¢ is available in retail stores in Ohio, the company will continue its legal-age smokers promotions, including a digital marketing   for the TryTAAT landing page (  and an ‚ÄúOut -of-home media   ‚Äùon fuel dispenser displays launched earlier this week at 1,087 gas stations in Ohio.  This is what Tim Corkum said:  >Of all the tobacco category products I have worked with, TAAT ‚Ñ¢ is an outlier in terms of demand at its early stage. While at Philip Morris International, the world's largest tobacco company, I introduced dozens of new tobacco brands across Canada and the Caribbean. While many of the new products were reordered from retailers after the first few weeks in the market, none of nearly 60% of the stores where they were originally offered were reordered. I believe our patient, methodical, and disciplined approach to bringing TAAT ‚Ñ¢ to the $ 814 billion global tobacco industry contributed to this strong early-stage performance, and I am confident that we will see these results in both Ohio and in other markets where we can launch TAAT ‚Ñ¢ in 2021 and beyond.  The question is, will everyone enjoy the TAAT ‚Ñ¢ cigarette? The answer is a resounding no! Just as little as a Beyond Meat burger tastes good to everyone or a Tesla is for everyone. But what you can read from the high rate of reorders is a high level of acceptance from those who have tried TAAT ‚Ñ¢. For me, this is the essential parameter that can actually make TAAT ‚Ñ¢ a success ala Tesla and Beyond Meat - as unbelievable as it may sound.    What Tesla is to the automotive market and what Beyond Meat is to the food market, TAAT ‚Ñ¢ is to the cigarette market. If one can achieve only   market share of the US tobacco market, then this would amount to an annual turnover of 1 billion USD.    I'm in at   and I'm long on this one.   billion smokers could be facing a major revolution and the one trillion US dollar (1,000 billion) tobacco industry facing total upheaval! The focus is actually on TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (NYSE: A2P6PR)!  The Taat Beyond Tobacco ‚Ñ¢ cigarettes are a special class in this field, a tobacco-free cigarette that smells and tastes like a "real cigarette" and at the same time eliminates negative elements such as the addictive nicotine content, even though it is made from 100% natural ingredients!  In the end, I am not a financial advisor so don't take anything for granted and invest only what you can afford to lose in a worst case scenario. But for this one I am sure we could potentially see 10x if not even 100x gains at some point. This stock has a noble cause.  If you look at Steve Jobs and Elon Musk people stuck with them because they have a "noble cause" (there was a study that Apple users had the same brain scan when discussing Apple or discussing religion). TAAT's founder Joe seems to be a good face to lead this "noble cause" of saving people from nicotine. It should not be just about business and market domination but primarily about a movement, a worthy cause.

Fuck GME: a word from a gay bear
First of all y'all ain't as retarded as me since I got no GME and only have that one free AMC from RH. Buying Puts on GME made me only five bucks after I bought a put and sold so as a gay bear from the sub I can't help but speak up.   Bunch of degens attracting unwanted attention is making this sub a weird GME fan club so I encourage all you theta gang and bear gang to speak up.   I had a conversation with the wife's boyfriend today and she he is leaving us for another wsb kids n wife cuz they up like 2000% from em diamond hands. Truly amazing however, I believe at the end of the day y'all GME boys gotta gtfo your positions one way or another. Haven't seen good los porn for too long. It is boring seeing the same theme over the past week or two.   The worst part of all this GME shit is that we are now being labeled as retail investors. It is way above my iq to read on wtf is going on following the amazing nut squeeze on Melvin and his boy friends while trying to search by new. My tiny brain hurts. So I just have one question, when you duckers gonna sale so I my puts can print too? Tired this sub all the sudden being flooded with so many ppl knows more than shit post and FDs. Y'all too successful at Yoloing gotta bring your diamond hands to r investing if you holding shares and your option is deep itm with expiration passing next Friday.  TLTR just tell me when y'all gonna sell your GME positions, it is okay to lie. But hearing it will make a gay bear happy  Once there are only bulls left then this can happen    PS sell GME puts

A letter to this generation
As I write this, I‚Äôm sitting next to my window and looking out at the lights, contemplating everything that has transpired. A generation of people affected by 2008; many of whom had just taken their first steps into adulthood, or were just kids when they overheard the desperation in their parents‚Äô voices as they discussed their bills, only to be drowned out by intimidating talk of recessions and bailouts from the news. The very institutions Americans had placed their faith in were backed into a corner by their own greed, and this generation took the fall. Many stood up to the injustice and were met with splashes of c , a humiliating mockery from the very same who had designed their fate. This generation was shaped in one way or another by the 2008 Financial Crisis, and now, this very same generation has seen that it was all for naught; that those who were responsible for 2008 have not learned; that greed has yet again led to a black swan event once only discussed in our own small corner of the internet; that the institutions will still do everything they can to avoid responsibility. But unlike 2008, the power is in the hands of the people, the hands of those who endured those hard years, the hands of this generation. And as I sit here, gazing out my window at a city of stars, I feel at peace. I know that this generation is the one that endured enough to say no more, and the one that not only has the strength and resolve to fight, but the one that has the will to sacrifice for the greater good. To this generation, to all of you, it has been an honor to be apart of this movement, and I can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow.

Earnings for Week 2/1 with High Short Squeeze potential
Hello all,     For a while I have tracked the companies reporting earnings every week with a high short interest and high number of Days to Cover (given average volume). I figured this would be helpful for the rest of us to see what companies have a high short squeeze potential, as well as a catalyst in the short term.

GME Original Analysis and Thesis for why I bought in at $13.
Evernote link for better formatting      Thesis:     With the advent of online gaming and e-sport, Gamestop is prime to make a turnaround and grow again assuming it will change direction and adapt post Covid. The support of Ryan Cohen, a e-commerce marketing guru, has brought hope to a once-beloved brand and ignited the flame of this reality.  The stock is also enticing because of its 138% short interest which is the highest percentage in the market. Thus, a remote chance of a short squeeze could occur.  Majority of investors do actually believe in the company and is not in it for  just the short squeeze opportunity.       &nbsp;  --     Background:     Gamestop was once the most prolific gaming retailer in the brick and mortar time period. They made their profits by rebuying used games/gaming paraphernalia at low prices and marking them up greatly. They relied mainly on foot traffic due to a subpar online presence and they were slow to change. The low price and convenience of online shopping had won over shoppers causing the demise of brick and mortar. Large brands started disappearing left and right and now it was Gamestop's turn with a boost from Covid. Investors wrote GameStop off as a dinosaur company with its shares eventually dropping to $  dollar.  --     Results:      Hedge funds saw this and decided to go short on them, betting on their demise like all the others. The funds abused the mechanism of the market to cause a large selling pressure onto the stock, forcing the stock price down and accelerating the demise. Could this be manipulation? If a hedge fund were to short a company out of spite, they could very possibly bankrupt a company.    --     How did Gamestop survive for so long?     Even though they weren't raking in e-commerce profit, they were still profitable. It was just that that profit stream was shrinking. The profits were also concentrated at a fraction of their stores. As they closed unprofitable stores, they were able to offset cost slightly. Investors were also holding on to the imminent release of the new console super cycle. Investors noted that the golden days were right after the new consoles were released and Dec 2020 couldn't come quicker. Gamestop was patience and managed their financials well with a strong balance sheet. Investors had underpriced the real estate of theirs. They were not valued for growth anymore so they weren't in a situation to raise capital risk free. They have several billions in short-term and long-term debt but  they had 600 million cash in hand to cushion with. Lastly, the Nintendo switch had just came out and was the best selling gaming console ever. Gamestop rode the tailend of Nintendo success all through 2020 with Switch sales offsetting losses in the other gaming segments.        --     The turnaround:     A new management team had join in August 2019 that set to slim down the company. They were much more aggressive and sought to aggressively close stores. A comprehensive turnaround plan called GameStop ReBoot  was announced with 4 elements:       1. Optimized the Core Business   	Reducing unprofitable stores and focusing on what works   2. Become the Social / Cultural Hub for Gaming   	Turning Gamestop into a experience center and not just a store   3. Build a Frictionless Digital Ecosystem   	Re  the supply chain to be e-commerce focused   4. Transform Vendor Partnership   	Rekindle and make new partnerships       Like all new managements, this one needed time but unfortunately Covid complicated the plans. Investors became increasingly doubtful and even bearish. However, they had underestimated the future of gaming.   --   The first significant move was bringing Reginald Fils-Aim√© onto the board of directors. Reginald was known for his market prowess bring Nintendo to what it is today. Investors loved that.   --   As Covid happened, working from home and home entertainment exploded. Logitech, Corsair, Bestbuy exploded. Online gaming was projected to be very ludicrous in the next decade and Covid had shorten this timeline. Online gaming took off. Activision, Electronic Arts, Zynga, Tencent all exploded. Apple app revenue from their gaming segment exploded. Investors had repriced these stocks higher taking advantage of the first player advantage. One notable company that changed in valuation was Logitech, they were a value company but relabeled to growth. What was missing from this list was Gamestop. The bullishness in gaming was there and everyone else profited. If there was hope of a GME turnaround, their valuation model would certainly flip to a growth model at higher PE multiples. It was only fair.      --   The next big event that occurred  was in October 2020. Gamestop announced a partnership with Microsoft which was the first real tangible milestone on the turnaround plan. Investors started to give the company a second look.  Microsoft Partnership caused shares to rally 30% in a day. A bullish sign that the big players haven't given up. However this was short lived as shorts continue to drive the price down as there was no concrete details on the revenue sharing partnership, only that "for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well." To me this sounds very bullish that Microsoft still believes in Gamestop.     --   Next came news that the well-respected businessmen Ryan Cohen released that he had bought up 13% of Gamestop shares, becoming a minority owner. Ryan Cohen was the founder of Chewy, a Petsmart online branch that outcompeted Amazon. Investors labeled him an e-commerce guru/genius. He had bought shares at $  and slowly gobbled up more as the price increased. Rumors started speculating that Cohen would takeover and transform Gamestop and it was materialized when Cohen sent the management a very aggressive letter.    --   "GameStop‚Äôs leadership should immediately conduct a strategic review of the business and share a credible plan for seizing the tremendous opportunities in the rapidly-growing gaming sector. GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences ‚Äì not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem."    --   It was a do this or else there will be a hostile takeover. The letter was sent three weeks before Q3 Earnings and investors were now watching intensively for details of a roadmap or of a Cohen reference during the earning call. ER came around and management was mute beside the announcement of a shelf offering of 100mil. Company performance wise, they were negative on profit but had still beaten expectations. The expedited closure of unprofitable of the stores helped. The stock would have soared had not an offering been announce (offering dilutes shares) so instead GME dropped 17%. From the conference calls, many bull investors felt reluctantly weary of this turnaround while some even dismissed management consideration of Ryan and piled on to the shorts. A week later, a filing by Ryan Cohen showed that he had continued to believe that the stock was undervalued and bought even at $  This news rekindled the speculation that Ryan Cohen was going to do a takeover. Stock bounced and soared to $  dollars for the next few weeks before dropping to $       --     Jan 2021 - The first squeeze:     Shorts were still convinced that Gamestop would not be turn around and so they held steady with a short interest above 130%. Some short sellers had left while new ones piled on.      --   Monday, Jan 11th, Gamestop decided to drop bombs to the short:   - First with an announcement that there was 309% increase in e-commerce sales from 2019 holiday season,   increase in comparable store sales,   decrease in total sales.   	- The biggest takeaway was that their new e-commerce strategy was working. 309% increase is massive. Also this followed their original plan to concentrate on their core. Rise in sales of profitable store was also shown. The closure unprofitable stores hit their total sales but it was not much and implied that these stores were dead weight. They slimmed their bleeding cost segment and increased their profit. This was super bullish.   - Secondly, a board of advisor switch up was announced. Ryan Cohen and two main Chewy guys were hopping on, replacing 3 other people.  	- Ryan essentially brought Chewy Management to Gamestop. They know have 1/3 of the company's vote.   	- GME Management knew that a takeover was happening, hostile or not and so they opened the doors. They also expanded Ryan Cohen's ability to buy up to 20% of the total shares   	- Permit And Hestia Capital also align more with his vision so that would put them at a 5/9 majority   Result: Even with the news, the stock price stayed range bound at   and volume was extremely low for that Monday and Tuesday.  Shorts were once again depressing the price. However, Wednesday came and the first of the shorts closed their position while bulls bought calls. The stock soared.

Careful with the silver posts, most of these posts come from accounts created in the last couple days!
I went into the r/wallstreetsilver subreddit and analyzed comments and posts. I found that 80% of them came from accounts mostly created in the last 2 days. Pretty suspect.. who do these people really work for?!   I also spent 3 hours of my life going through each post and calling them out on their new accounts.   Stick to the gameplan, we can focus on silver after.   Positions: none. My GME covered call got assigned at $14 back at the end of December. Fml.
How to instant transfer from RH FAST and without fees
If you have a Robinhood debit card, you can set it up as your payment method on FB messenger and send your spouse or yourself somehow (beware of sending it to someone else and gifting tax). It goes through immediately with no fees. For example, I sent it to my husband. Then it gets auto deposited into our bank for immediate use. No needing to wait days for them to transfer it to your bank.   I can then use the funds to purchase stock WeBull or another platform. Obviously, you have to sell stock to access your capital so I wouldn‚Äôt use this method for the money invested in AMC and GME. Personally, I‚Äôm leaving those stocks in Robinhood for now but transferring any other capital that I can to a platform that doesn‚Äôt limit my purchasing power.  You can check how much cash you have accessible by clicking on transfers and scrolling down to ‚Äúwithdrawable cash.‚Äù This is not financial advice. I‚Äôm just an idiot who knows how to pull out.    There‚Äôs also an account number and routing number on RH. Even if you don‚Äôt have a card, this may be a means to transfer.        GME      Edit: Reminding you that selling is a taxable event, transferring brokerages generally is not but takes longer. This is merely a suggestion from a moron in direct response to those looking to liquidate other stock and buy more on platform that allows unlimited buys.

This is INSANE news, guys.

It's already been claimed by monster media conglomerate MGM, meaning this will be a BIG-TIME hollywood movie & book!  If this isn't an adrenaline shot of motivation to give Ben one hell of a story to tell, I don't know what is!  DIAMOND HANDS MOTHERFUCKERS, WE'RE OFFICIALLY IN SCENE 1 OF A MOVIE RIGHT NOW.

It‚Äôs hard enough, if not impossible for them to cover their short positions on GME and these hedge funds are, for the most part also attempting to short AMC.   Seems logical that if you‚Äôre priced out of GME or maxed out of shares and calls you‚Äôre able to buy (depending on what brokerage firm you‚Äôre using) you dump what you can into AMC  üåï as well and HOLD  üèª  all positions.

Someday, someone's going to write about the GME Big Squeeze...
They're going to ask, how did WSB get one over on hedge funds and establishment money?     we will point them to the forum where everything is recorded and archived and discussed in public view.   They're going to ask, why did one of the scare tactics, disinformation, or unequal access to the market not deter you?     we will point them to the forum where everything is recorded and archived and discussed in public view.   They're going to ask, surely there was something hidden, a strategy the shorters and journalists couldn't see that lead to their defeat?     we will point them to the forum where everything is recorded and archived and discussed in public view.   They're going to ask, what did you do with your gains?     we will point them to the forum where everything is recorded and archived and discussed in public view.
It's not about the short squeeze in $SLV
I've seen a lot of posts saying that $SLV is just a distraction from $GME and autists wont be able cause a short squeeze in $SLV, while this may be true it shouldn't matter. The point is to take delivery of as much physical silver as possible. The COMEX is overleveraged and has a tiny fraction of the physical silver they have written contracts for. If we can cause a default in the paper silver market or a runaway silver price as paper markets scramble to buy up physical silver that doesnt exist, it would have a much greater impact than taking down a couple of hedge funds. The COMEX and LBMA have been manipulating the price of gold and silver for decades by printing paper contracts while they have nothing in their vaults, it's time they paid the price. If citadel are long $SLV just keep buying $GME until citadel are bankrupt then buy their liquidated $SLV shares.  Edit: Im not saying anything against $GME, hold $GME until moon and citadel is dust. After this has happened buy physical silver.
Citadel and Point72 Rivalry
Citadel and P72 haven't exactly been on good terms.  They constantly poach each other's portfolio managers.  But they decided to work together in 2021 in order to stay alive.  This is an indication of something much bigger that's gonna blow up.               Will retarded   beat greedy suited  ?        ü§≤   $GME 10 shares @ $300+  I'm in it to out the corrupted system... or until it hits $88,  for that sweet Chinese New Year hongbao money üßßüßß.  Thank you WSB for educating me about counterfeit shares.

What is 1,000 x $1,000?
Larry Summers just now on Bloomberg TV again
Larry Summers (the former treasury secretary ‚Äî    said that the "retail trading (squeeze)" may be fraud (meaning coordinated manipulation), but drew an equivalent to the short selling by the hedge funds, calling it "no more attractive" (  it is maybe more fraud than the retail GME squeeze) "especially because of the public bashing of the companies they go short" by the hedge fundies.  Will update with YouTube link when they post it.

GME is life changing
First off,    only. Second, I'm holding till the very end, and I'm strapped into my  . Third, 16 shares   Now, if the price of of GME does hit 10k, this would do so so much. After taxes, I can pay off all my college debt, get a new car, keep 25k for day trading, give my immediate family 5k each, make a 10k donation, and put the remaining 16kish into a long term savings fund. My life would literally be changed and I would probably shed tears of joy.  TLDR for you smooth brain soldiers:   GME    ->$10,000+
My Brothers, I BEG you to buy UUP calls or cheap puts as a hedge NOW
Look, I would never ask you guys to stop your beautifully retarded crusade. Those GME open letters made me cry harder than when I lost my Velcro shoes. But I ask you to once more strap on that propeller hat, crack a juice box and really  hear me out. You are my brothers and I don‚Äôt want you to get caught in the crossfire.   What‚Äôs the big deal? So it turns out that us glue eaters are an absolute force to be reckoned with when acting in unison. But this short squeeze is so powerful, we have the potential to inadvertently set off an insolvency bomb that will put a hell of a dent in the market. You might already be scratching your head but allow me to explain.   Hedge funds are feeling the pain. If this squeeze happens like we hope, these guys will be margin called. This is happening at a time when we‚Äôve already been looking at a record Call/put ratio for months. The reason that matters is because these institutions that have been selling you guys all these calls have to buy shares to decrease risk when they sell you those calls. They‚Äôre sitting on a huge stockpile of shares all across the board at a time when no one has cash.   Why does no one want cash? Cash is and has been the worst thing to hold since the housing bubble. To put it plainly, the fed lies to us about the true rate of inflation with something called the Consumer Price Index. They do that because if they told the truth, the government would be required to compensate for the increased inflation when they administer social security. It‚Äôs a story for another time but just understand that our assets (stocks,houses,whatever) are not necessarily increasing in value even though it looks like it. Your buying power is decreasing because of the quantitative easing that‚Äôs been happening since the housing crisis. So cash has been a guaranteed loser to hold for a long time. That‚Äôs especially true for our current situation with the absolutely ape shit printing. You might not see it in your milk price right away but you can bet your sweet ass that all those corporate bonds being bought are allowing these companies to buy back their own shares and artificially send their stock price flying. So nobody likes holding cash right now. Not you, not mutual funds, not sovereign powers.   Why is this so bad and why should I care? Well nobody is sitting on cash reserves, including the hedge funds you‚Äôre blowing up. When volatility increases, they HAVE to decrease risk and you Velcro assassins are sending volatility to the moon along with the rest of the retail crowd. They are going to have to liquidate a massive amount of shares from the stockpiles they‚Äôve been accumulating just to avoid getting margin called. Or they need to get cash that no one really has available to lend them. If the mother of all short squeezes happens, we could see a wild scramble for dollars since we are in the midst of the biggest credit bubble imaginable. They‚Äôll all need it because insolvency will be knocking on the door and no one wants to be the one with a shit ton of debt when it all goes south.   What should I do? Continue your crusade but please please have a hedge. Buy a few UUP calls. They‚Äôre dirt cheap and if shit hits the fan like last March, they‚Äôll at least 5-10x. In my opinion it‚Äôs the best way I know to have an inexpensive long dollar ace in the hole. Or buy cheap puts. In fact, let me know if you have a great idea for cheap puts. I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt the best explanation. Just wanted to get it out fast before market open.   TLDR: You‚Äôre my glue eating brothers in arms and I‚Äôm trying to watch your back. Buy a few cheap UUP calls as a hedge and keep giving those hedge funds hell.  Good luck my brothers. Edit: holy shit you guys. I‚Äôm not telling you to stop buying GME. I‚Äôm telling you to get a cheap hedge.

AMC - Why do I see a company that is about to go Bust?
They seem like they are hanging on by a thin thread. ( (Quick glance at their Financials 2017 to present))  1. Debt filled. 2. Weak profit margins. 3. Weak Cash Flow.  Can they survive?: They can be  restructured  but the current state of the company looks questionable. I haven't dug into their 10-K's but I glanced over some of their filings and they stated somewhere in 2020 that if they couldn't raise more cash they were gonna go kaput by 2021.  What does their future look like?: What's the "New Normal" after COVID? We see streaming services up, Movie studios are fighting to go direct. I mean how much longer can theaters run a profit YoY with the current climate? Am I underestimating the vaccine? The luxury of a night out?  Opinion: Seems like they owe a ton of money, their weak profits are spent mostly paying back interest on loans, and the cash they have is spent barely keeping them afloat.  I Need other opinions here to add to this info because Shorts are starting to look good right about now.
It‚Äôs not much but it‚Äôs all I   now.

My Theory for why the S3 data is wrong.
Disclaimer: I hold GME and I am retarded, so this is probably wrong, but it is definitely not financial advice.  Anyway, here what I think these sneaky fuckers did:  Let‚Äôs say Melvbitch is short 100 shares. He needs to get 100 shares somehow to close this position to make it look like he got out of his short, but how does he get them? Calls.   So, he buys a $  1/29 call and exercises it (we will assume that SIG actually has the shares, so this doesn‚Äôt trigger a gamma squeeze). But, he needs money to buy and exercise this bad boy, and where does he get that? Calls again.   So, he sells 4-5 (based on what I am seeing value wise) OTM calls to get this money. This maintains his short position whilst making it appear that he is no longer short SHARES. He can also spread to the news that he closed a short position.   If these OTM calls that he sold them expire OTM, he wins and gets out of the short basically.   But no, thanks to the norse legend himself and all of you diamond handed autists, those bad boys expired ITM on Friday. Did Melvbitch have the shares for when these options got exercised, no. Did he get assigned them and is therefore still short despite making it appear that he is out? Yes. Now this fucker has to buy even more shares than he originally owed.   Tldr: if I am correct, the S3 data is missing the options fuckery that they performed last week and they still have to buy hella shares.   GME            Edit: someone pls correct me if the S3 data would catch assigned shares.

A message to the old-timers here.
I wanted to take a moment and thank you all sincerely for the help that I've received and the answers to my many questions these last few days.  I get it- you guys were here already. You have a culture and you enjoy being part of this community. Suddenly, every dingus from all four corners of the Internet is coming up in here, going "what's a stonk?!" and "should I buy a 15c GME for next year?" and "my boomer dad told me to invest in ETFs should I do it?"  It's annoying. Your sub has been completely derailed by the GME mania, and for what it's worth, this moron appreciates those who have taken the time to share their knowledge. I have, no shit, learned more about finances and economics in the last week than I have in my entire life.   This isn't /r/investing. People should not be coming here for advice. So thanks for putting up with the noobs, and even having the decency to remind people that GME is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that if they make enough for a extra large tendies meal with extra dipping sauce this time, they may just as easily lose it all on the next outrageous OTM call that they're scheming up.  You probably didn't ever imagine it would happen, but you have most likely shown thousands or even millions of young people all over the world how to access and understand the stock market, which is going to promote financial literacy on a level that we haven't seen before outside of the rich and elite.  I'm not just holding GME for maximum tendies and a trip 'round the moon, I'm doing it because I like the stock- and I learned all about this wonderful stock right here.  TL;DR: YOUNG APE LIKE OLD APE, THANK FOR BANANAS, HOLD GME FOREVER      Edit: Position: 36 GME @   avg, holding long.
How High Can GME Go?
This is some retarded, third-grade level DD, some shit you could do as long as you know what a market cap and multiplication is.  We're in uncharted territory here and are witnessing a short squeeze which has never been seen before. We also don't have retrospect to show us what really happened as it all played out.  But we can look to the fabled Volkswagen short squeeze a while ago. I don't care about short interest or float or whatever: Volkswagen became the biggest company in the world at that time due to a short squeeze. If we consider market cap alone, how high can GME go?  Let's use 1 trillion as a nice round number. Sure there are companies with larger caps, but fuck I don't want to complicate things. GME (according to corrupt-as-fuck Robinhood) has a cap of 17 billion. Divide 1 trillion by this and we get the number 57. GME has to go up 57 times it's current price to be a trillion dollar company.   330 57 is about $19,000 per share. If this squeeze played out like VW back in the day, we can look forward to at least this target. I could be wrong, I could be retarded, but this is what the math is pointing to if history somewhat repeats itself.  TL:DR: Buy and hold GameStop with    .  Disclaimer: I own 5 GME shares. I am long the stock. I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm retarded.. This is not financial advice. I'm drinking and fucked around with a calculator and considered it DD.
Some questions to consider.
Whatever happened in the  market last week has definitely made history. But this historical time is also slowly turning into a hysterical time.    I wanted to put forth a few questions. There are no answers here as answers would be different for everyone. All i ask is that you consider these questions:   1. Everyone who is waiting for monday to buy AMC in the hope of GME like short squeeze: what is the biggest enemy of a short squeeze? More available shares to buy rights? AMC just did another stock offering and diluted its shares. What makes you think it will still fly like GME?   2. Everyone who is wishing death to robinhood and move to fidelity and orher brokers. Do you remember pre-robinhood times and do you think brokers would have ever made trading free on their own? Hell, do you think this 'revolution' would have been possible without Robinhood in first place? What stops bigger broker go back to $5 per trade fee once Robinhood (and now webull) are dead?   3. Everyone who is pushing SLV. Do you know who are the biggest holders of SLV? Do you seriously believe retail investors would benefit?  Think wisely. Make history. Be proud of what this sub has achieved. But as everyone here says  do your DD.

MINIMIZING DISTRACTIONS, EYES ON THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY
I wish I knew about market manipulators and short sellers a few months ago. I also wished to know what DFV thought about GME. Some people in here thought I was stupid to hold my GME shares.
I've almost never spent my life savings, nor real life and nor in games (  Minecraft - as much as it can sound silly, I always managed to earn a lot of game currency and never used it until the server got restarted). Same I did with my shares, I didn't want to sell them, GME was one of the first companies of which I bought the shares of.  I basically was a   . Until the day some you were able to change my mindset into selling those shares.        was my first post on here, in December.     I was laughed at for wanting to hold my GME shares, I was new into trading and that was enough to make me believe I was doing wrong.  That was when the price was at ~17. About the title, I wish I knew about market manipulators so that I could know what was actually going on with GME. I wish I knew what DFV thought about GME so to don't feel all alone into being a   .  Moral of the story - if you're new on trading and new in here, just know there are many retards like you who like to make you believe you're more retards than them, while we are all fucking apes.      I know someone who told me multiple times that GME wasn't going to rise, or to sell GME, and everytime they said it GME rised. Today (Sunday) that someone told me - "Why are you making a meme? It's over already." - so...

The role the government will play
Here is my smooth brain theory on what the government wants to do with gme going forward. This my fellow autists is what it all comes down to. We are sitting in a win/win/win/lose situation and just so happens an army of retards is occupying one of the win spaces. The next space is for the big investors in gme see other posts if you want to know who they are and the company itself they will benefit most if shorts cover into moass. The third win is the government, these firms hoard these billions and the cronies can‚Äôt touch it and what would be better than a nice juicy short term capital gains tax on billions they are licking their lips.  Tldr:            Edit: I am not a financial expert nor is this financial advice I just like this stock.

$GME is so much more than just sticking it to Wall Street. It's more than just the money. It's us standing up for our right to a free market and us refusing to play by different rules just because we don't have the money. And because WE LIKE THE STOCK ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
This only makes what going on even more fishy
GME Oddity and what it could mean
So I've been waiting to see someone talk about this. The TD ameritrade % held by institutions changed     which is an odd number because that would mean that there is 71-72 million share. However there are only   shares. Me being the autist I am, I checked for SEC filings which I couldn't find anything as of friday. Used a calculator (its that weird thing with number buttons) to count each institutions holdings and it checked out to the reported number.   I'm not claiming that I'm smart, in fact I'm a dumbass who made most of his gains off of TLSA. However, and this is a big however, unless I am even dumber then I think I am, there can not be more than 100% of a companies shares. This means that EVEN THE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING ARTIFICIAL SHARES.   Again the if comes in, if I'm not a total dumbass, it means that just the institutions have the ability to diamond hand this bitch into infinity.    So overall where does this leave the retards and autists and fomoers. Well, I don't fucking know. Some how this situation has to fix itself, if the government steps in we might get fucked. GME could step in and we get fucked. OR the free market resolves itself and we all go to uranus where there is a special tendie town built for gmetards.  I am not a financial advisor, nothing I say holds any weight, I'm just an idiot who noticed an oddity in some percentages.
Hollywood already eyeing movie about r/WallStreetBets, GameStop
The dirty little secret about why hedge funds and banks have long positions in SLV
They are naked shorting silver futures with extreme leverage.  If you are a big player with over 50,000 shares of SLV you are allowed to redeem your shares for real silver.       They do it to partially hedge their naked short of silver in the futures market, so that if some of their contracts call their bluff they can pull silver from SLV to meet the obligations of the futures contract.       Their stake in SLV is not even close to enough to cover the 250-1 naked short position they have in the futures market if enough longs start demanding delivery.       Not everything is a conspiracy, and a pre-existing position in SLV that a fund has carried for 'futures market insurance' isn't related to the GME squeeze.      GME to the Moon. SLV to the Moon.  Both can happen and I have advocated for us to get GME to $1000 first before we move our gains to SLV.
10k is not a meme! Let's make it into reality!!!    ü™ê
I‚Äôm so grateful to have so much money cause of wallstreet.
Any long-term thinking ?
So ever since this $GME short-squeeze along with other short-squeezes has been going on, a lot more degenerates have joined this sub. Last week there was   million degenerates. As I am writing this, there are over   million degenerates       ü¶ß  Seems like a lot of people want to chase the big money fast (OFC who wouldn‚Äôt want to do that)   While this short-squeeze has been going on, and the sell off that just happened, a lot of good stocks has gone down, including Apple and Facebook after great earnings numbers. Even tho Tesla missed earnings expectations, Tesla is still a great investment.   What‚Äôs interesting is that if anyone has watched Keith Gill (u/DeepFuckingValue ) YouTube videos (Roaring Kitty) he invested into GameStop because he states that he‚Äôs a value investor. (7/27/20 and 8/04/20)   Keith Gill took the time and educated himself on GameStop‚Äôs position.  Keith saw that GameStop was highly undervalued. He saw that they have more cash on the balance sheet and that the market cap was less than the amount of cash on the balance sheet.  Keith researched about consumers spending habits on physical vs digital consoles and games. Also on physical games vs physical movies and physical music copies.  Keith saw that GameStop has potential to make a lot of money on the new Xbox and PlayStation consoles.  If you have any long-term or short-term ideas, please feel welcome to share your thoughts.

Robinhood CEO: "We're helping those left behind by Wall Street, not hedge funds". Don't let them fool you!
# Robinhood has now taken out ads which are disguised as media articles. Don't let them fool you!       "We built Robinhood for our customers. For millions of people who have felt left behind by America‚Äôs financial system. For people who felt turned away by the big Wall Street financial institutions. For those who are making their voices heard through the markets and showing the world that investing is for everyone.¬†  Last week, we witnessed something the stock market has never quite experienced before.   on a small number of stocks triggered wild gyrations in prices, massive volatility that prompted clearinghouses to take swift action to protect the plumbing that handles stock trading every day.¬†"
GME - Eric Feigl-Ding on Twitter
GME: Next Steps
I've gotten more than a few DMs so I just want to offer my thoughts in a larger setting. I apologize for wasting others time and space.  Background: MBA w/+20 years including stints in Investment Banking, Equity Research, VC and Corporate. ( = I know enough to be dangerous.)    Should I invest tomorrow?    I would invest with the understanding that you're playing a high risk/high reward game vs. the best on Wall Street (WS) who aren't accustomed to losing. (Hell, you put a 50% dent in one of the most high profile HFs on the Street.)  Reddit/WSB (WSB) is beating WS at its own game and WS will not accept that. The reason that I would still buy shares is because I'm perfectly comfortable waiting out the shorts, who I believe didn't cover entirely based on some sketchy trading volumes and price action on Thursday known as ladder attacks, which is basically artificially lowering a security's price by selling it back and forth between two parties. (Note: the WSJ is reporting that Melvin closed their positions at a loss of 50% to the fund. Maybe they did, though I don‚Äôt trust Melvin or the WSJ. Regardless, I have no doubt that other HFs are salivating at the short opportunity given where GME shares are currently trading.)    The key is the somewhat unreliable short data which comes out next week.   As I mentioned in a previous post, getting accurate short data is next to impossible. It makes polling data look flawless by way of comparison. It has gotten to the point that I don't believe anything I read because there is not only time lag but synthetic longs and ladder attacks all of which serve to obscure the data. No firm wants it positions known so there is a strong incentive to obscure/hide the data. Another reason why Melvin publicly releasing its positions is just highly unusual/odd.  I would also be aware that a lot of HFs are making bank off the GME volatility by selling options and taking long positions. Just look at    To use an analogy, I'm a lifelong Giants fan who put a $1,000 down on the Giants beating the Pats in the 2008 Superbowl. The Pats went undefeated all season and the Giants entered the playoffs as a wildcard. The bookie even told me when I placed the bet that I was just throwing away my money. I bet the money line,  , no points, and ending up winning $5,000. The bookie just smiled at me when I handed him my ticket. Sometimes you just gotta trust your gut and stay loyal to your instincts no matter what others think. It's what separates the men from the boys.  TLDR: It‚Äôs a clich√©, but don‚Äôt invest in GME what you can‚Äôt afford to lose. At this point, you're going against some very powerful hedge funds,  , the Pats in 2008. That said, WSB already scored a very impressive victory and is retarded enough to not realize how good their competition really is (just like the Giants in the Super Bowl).    How will the media portray the narrative?    The media have already started spreading the narrative that WSB is going to cause a financial collapse rather than the true culprits, namely, the HFs which leveraged up 5x to short 120% of a company's shares outstanding setting the stage for an infinity squeeze, which is the financial equivalent of a nuclear chain reaction.  I mention this because the greatest risk IMHO is government intervention to quell the markets when the HFs start unloading positions to meet margin calls and borrowing costs. Nobody will lose sleep over a few billionaires losing a few commas in their net worth but hitting 401Ks, pension funds, and endowments is a different story. The official narrative will involve large commercial banks which loaned Melvin and other HFs billions to leveraged up with. These banks are regulated by the SEC and FDIC because they hold commercial deposits. When the narrative shifts from Melvin and HFs to names you recognize,  , JPM, BofA, Citi, rest assured the game is almost up. My guess is we're in the seventh or eighth inning of this game before it's stopped.  When people ask me about WSB I first discuss the HFs who created the conditions and then secondly note that thankfully we're dealing with a relatively small company in GME with a market cap of $20bn (so far!) compared to a company in the S&P 500, which is the basis for index funds and portfolio construction. In short, WSB did everyone a favor by calling attention to such a disastrous scenario in as optimal circumstances as possible. We should be very thankful WSB alerted the public to a systematic flaw in the financial system before a much greater meltdown occurred.  TLDR: The media are the PR firms for Wall Street. They exist to promote a narrative and receive access and compensation in return. They have no interest in reporting how the retail investor is being swindled. In contrast WSB did everyone a favor by pointing out a very serious systematic flaw in as optimal fashion as possible. This is the truth and the message that needs to be heard.    What‚Äôs the next step?    FINRA releases short data next Tuesday, February 9th for the period ending this past Friday, January 29th. Roughly 700mn GME shares changed hands last week or 10x the total shares outstanding so I'm pretty sure the short interest (SI) has fallen below 100%. However, I expect it to still be well above 50% given the typical HF‚Äôs risk appetite by which I mean they expect the retail investors to run for the exits sending shares back to $20-ish levels. I would love to know the borrowing costs for these firms because it basically tells you how long they can wait before such costs negatively impact their returns. My guess is until March when they have to report 1Q results to investors.  TLDR: Short data will show a decrease in SI, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it‚Äôs important to note that the risk/reward profile of the trade has moved.    How much good did this GME trade really do besides transfer a lot of wealth?    A heck of alot. At a minimum, WSB drew well needed scrutiny to the role of option clearings firms such as Citadel\  and Wolverine,  , the shadow economy, and their dual roles as market makers and hedge funds (players and referees). This screams conflict of interest. A revolution doesn‚Äôt happen overnight but this is another step forward in demonstrating how rigged the game is against the retail investor and guy in the (Main) street. Our regulatory agencies exist to enforce transparency and fairness. WSB has demonstrated that the derivatives market and particularly short selling lack both and have the capability to cause a financial panic. And of course, there is the unbelievable amount of charitable donations from WSB gains which prove who the real Robinhood is. (Sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist).    Citadel alone handles more than 25% of US equity flow. The company is a monster and barely anyone knows it exists, which is how they like it. They tell Wall Street what the regulation is and they pay Washington to enforce it. Former Fed heads Bernanke and Yellen have received almost a million in combined comp for speeches and advisory services from Citadel. In short, Citadel makes Goldman look like the United Way. And oh, yeah, 40% of Robinhood's revenue comes from Citadel in return for order flow. Assume what you will.  TLDR: Sunlight is the best disinfectant ‚Äì Justice Brandeis  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \   For the questions below and messages:  As I tried to communicate in the write-up, I would characterize the trade as more risky than a week ago when the SI was above 100%. I have no doubt many shorts have since closed. That said, I suspect the SI is still well above 50% given where the stock is and typical HF risk appetite. This is not a trade for your parents or grandparents.\  There is serious risk here that the share price collapses based on who the counterparties are and the lower SI. That said, I still like it and I'm in it. IMHO, it comes down to a game of chicken in the sense of who is willing to hold longer. HFs have investors to report to in 1Q vs. WSB who have bills, rent, and life to deal with. As my old coach would say, who wants it more.    The market has returned \~11% per year for the past decade. A good HF aims for 2x that. You guys are banking +1,000% returns on a trade lasting approximately a month against the best HFs on the Street. These returns are not normal or even within several standard deviations. They are clearly not for the faint-of-heart. We are in unchartered waters here. No shame in heading back. The fact you've come this far is simply amazing. Even you wife's boyfriend would be proud of you.
‚Äò‚ÄòTwas the night before   NYC...
For all you apes with Diamond Hands. Your Diamond Hands have gripped my heart!
New people should read up on the basics before posting
Title. I've noticed a growing sentiment with many of the more experienced WSBers that all seem to be saying a similar thing. I love the growing popularity of our sub but cant help but feel some of what made us unique has been diluted. Theres a lot of "what stock do I buy?" Or "When do I sell?" Those are things you ask r/investing not WSB.        WSB is a place of gambling and YOLOs. Sometimes we make money, a lot of people lose money. It's a fun time. Either way, you should know what you're throwing money at. Spend time reading on   and googling. With how many people we have now, putting easy to google questions in the discussion waters down the thread.        That's all. Godspeed, retards.      Edit: Fuck Im sorry
A Glimpse Into the Future (of WSB)
My prediction on how all this plays out:  1. Regardless if GME moons or fucking tanks, OG WSBers will sell for profit. Maybe not all of their shares but enough to lock in a good profit because that is what WSB is actually about. Finding good trades and making some damn good money or finding retarded trades and losing it all.   2.  After that, GAINS PORN.   3.  Next, all the new accounts who have joined during this crazy fun time who were actually in this ‚Äúfor a reason‚Äù will realize that they were the bag holders who got screwed the most by this trade and will turn on WSB because they had no idea what they were getting themselves into when joining this sub.   4. They all leave this group. We go down to hopefully 2M or less in this sub and we go back to the normal retardation that we all know and love.   5. Pray that WSB doesn‚Äôt get royally fucked by new SEC regulations and cancel culture.   TLDR: people get fucked WSB goes normal. Don‚Äôt sell.
Extremely grateful and hopeful. Exercised 2/4 of these bad boys to diamond hands into 5k!!!!
how it started ‚Äî> how it‚Äôs going   HOLD STRONG
Y‚Äôall are a bunch of hypocrites.
Stop complaining about the newcomers. Just stop. Idgaf if you remember skarelli jerkin off mods or seeing the GUh guy‚Äôs original post about unlimited margin. You were a normie acting all giddy and curious just everyone else is right now.   It‚Äôs also crazy how people are complaining there‚Äôs no other good dd anymore because of the gme hype. Like really dude? Wtf was FAANG all about then? Sector rotation? This sub didn‚Äôt talk about anything else except maybe mattresses.   Here‚Äôs another interesting fact. Wsb‚Äôs performance astronomically improved when the sub grew bigger. That means dd probably was actually scrutinized by actual people that were learning and not shilled by bots because we actually have a big enough audience to scrutinize properly. Like seriously why are you complaining when we‚Äôre winning.   Yeah I get some of you psychopaths can‚Äôt wait to see loss porn and sweet justice on these cocky cringe normies when the storm hits but let‚Äôs not forget even deepfuckingvalue started somewhere and asked questions to fuckheads like you. So yes, deal with it. We could actually get some autistic level dd due to the scrutiny.   Btw, mods you‚Äôre doing great.  EDIT: I turned my $600 stimulus into 19k only on GME. I blew up my account 3 times for the past 3 years. I‚Äôm still holding gme calls. Weekly. No shares. So gtfo with that bot shilling.   Also read the fucking side bar for you newbies. Just because I like calling out hypocrites doesn‚Äôt mean I like lazy people.
This has been insane guys, i cant wait to continue to ass rape hedgies all week, holding until 10k or bust
Are you going to leave Robinhood ?
With Robinhood placing restrictions on 50 stocks, I‚Äôd advise you‚Äôd guys to leave Robinhood if you can.   It is sad that Robinhood has had multiple outages in the past, not allowing any users to trade.  It is embarrassing and frustrating that they took money from Citadel and are protecting them by limiting your trades, even with trades for GM and SBUX !!!!   The only thing that is good about Robinhood is that it enforced the brokerage game to revolutionize with zero fee commission and allowing the opportunity to buy portions of stocks.   I‚Äôve been with Schwab for years, and it has the same features Robinhood has now. Yea, sure the app isn‚Äôt as pleasing as Robinhood‚Äôs but Schwab offers their insight and research on stocks. I‚Äôve heard that Robinhood charges for research, but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.   Also Robinhood did not disclose the fact they were selling order flow until they got caught and are being sued. I hope that all of you Robinhood traders sue Robinhood for everything from outages, to selling order flow and to the latest restrictions.   I wish all of you   well and to have a safe trading week and make some tendies
Alright you dumbasses, I think we need a post pinned to show people who come here after watching the news the good that comes from this, how the money gets spent by normal, hard working people when its out of the hedge funds
With the gloating we have seen by Cohen, the questions around what will happen as far as regulation given the strings the hedge funds can pull, I think its important that we give some ammunition to those in power who might be fighting on our side in Congress to show what us normal people do with this money, instead of the billionaires who let it ferment in their war chests and tell us to keep investing and we'll get as rich as them.   ;#x200B;             Dog surgery            Sick leave now start own business          Sister through medical treatment          Helped from depression after losing wife          Wife diagnosed MS, money to make up for med costs          Letters with $100 bills for GME employees          Normal guy saving for retirement          Just paying off their credit card, after 5k in debt          Mom‚Äôs lasik surgery          Expecting parent preparing for the baby          Paying rent          Guy who beat cancer getting another win in life          New tires          Teacher, father of two just getting by          Pay off debt          Losing job          Mothers retirement and prescriptions          Covid nurse on medical leave          Parents mortgage   u/  posted below that they're using the money to take time off work for their newborn.

My Boomer Mom's Opinion On What's Happening, and The Importance Of Us Getting Ahead of The Narrative
Yesterday I visited with my mother. She was born in the late 1950s. Ergo, Boomer.  Needless to say the topic of $GME came up.  Her words, "Oh, that's where a bunch of internet individuals are trying to artificially drive the price of a stock up to create a boom and bust"  Before I had an aneurysm and went full baby   on her, I calmed myself. She has been fed by the MM bought media.  I asked her to explain and she tried to turn CrookNetworkBoughtConversation on to show me. After some discussion and challenging her facts, it was obvious she was simply uninformed and had no reason to mistrust the network.  We must get ahead of this narrative in the most accessible way possible. Real life conversation. The younger generations do not own the media networks (yet) and the age distribution in congress is overwhelmingly elder.  ###If we do not get ahead of this narrative through word of mouth, we will be blamed for the next decade.       TL;DR Older   think this is younger   fault. Smashing    and getting angry will only reinforce this view. Young   must share   with older apes and calmly reject the narrative. We must preemptively challenge the narrative with everyone we can to get ahead of the shit storm. $GME to Uranus ü™êü™êü™ê      ###Edit : To better explain why the narrative matters, the concern is regulation and financial sector terms of service. If we become the "bad guys" the market will be rigged even further against us.

Gme contract volume expiring on feb 5th is around 46k
800 strike price alone has   volume! I think HFs are selling a bunch of shorts again. No doubt brokerages will try to limit buying to keep the price below 800 but if you get to 450 then 500 then 600, that might trigger another squeeze which will send gme to fucking andromeda.   450, 500, 600 has peak volume, over 2k contracts for each of those strikes with low volume in between if my memory serves.   Others can confirm if i got those strikes right.        gme

The DD on SLV - Updated 1/31 - clarity on what to buy
Edit: it appears someone may have created bots to downvote SLV posts because this got bombed immediately by downvotes.  Mods can you look into this? Either that or we really have become a monotheistic sub where only GME can be mentioned.     Hello silver surfers, clang gang, and monkeys who enjoy shiny things  Thank you for helping  .  Before I get GME hate mail, let me clarify I am still long GME and am looking for the moon in GME.  I also have a small long silver position.  Both positions are quite small as I am unfortunately not super well capitalized.  Many of the comments about buys on the previous post referenced order sizes I can only dream of at the moment, but I'm damn glad we have so much conviction behind this trade.  I created an official  . Not sure if I‚Äôll use it, but didn‚Äôt want anyone to impersonate me.  Clang gang acted so fast, that all the bullion dealers sold out over the weekend which is incredible, and overnight futures are spiking as we speak.  I continue to support the purchase of physical silver as a way to continue the short squeeze if you can find any of course.  The short squeeze thesis is built upon tying up as much of the physical silver into our diamond hands as possible.  With that said, I thought I would add some clarity to my position on the various options out there to play the silver squeeze.    It is organized into 2 sections:      1. the futures market (for big players)      2. alternatives (for smaller players  )       1.      The futures market:   for the squeeze to really happen, we desperately need some of the bigger pocketed players who have access to the futures market to purchase silver contracts on the open market.    If you can play in the futures market, it is imperative that you do so.    I have been trying to find a retail broker who will allow customers to take physical delivery rather than force cash settlement but have had no luck so far.  If anyone knows of such a retail broker, please let me know so I can update the post with the info.  This is by far the most important piece of the short squeeze equation.  Let me explain:  When traders hold long futures contracts to expiration, they are making a statement that they want to take delivery.  Taking delivery does not mean the silver is transferred to your house, but rather it goes to the CME warehouse.  You can go pick it up from the warehouse or arrange transfer, or you can pay $  a month per 1000 ounces to just store it at the warehouse (which is quite cheap at that scale).  The futures market allows players to use extreme amounts of margin and leverage, which is where the 'naked shorts' come from.  They are able to sell massive amounts of silver with very little collateral to back it up, and no actual silver on hand.    This also explains why institutions such as citadel or others hold positions in the ETFs like SLV.   If you have more than 50,000 shares in SLV, you can request to have your share of the silver delivered to you.  They are hedging against their naked shorts in the futures market by trying to gain access to a source of silver should they need it.  The thing is, if the short squeeze occurs, even their holdings in SLV will not be enough to meet their obligations.  In order for the buyers to call their bluff they need to not use their margin power, as tempting as it may be to do so.  They need to only purchase as much silver in the futures market as they actually have money in their account to cover the final purchase (the price is locked in at the time of the futures contract purchase).  Then as expiration approaches, refuse to settle in cash, and pony up the money to actually buy the silver and have it delivered.  At that time the seller needs to find silver fast, and tries to purchase it from somewhere else to meet their contractual obligations.  The rush of all the naked shorts to try and find physical silver is what massively drives up the price and causes the short squeeze.  There may even be dips in the futures market if the buyers are planning to do the squeeze.  This is because they will not be using margin whiles the seller are.  The sellers may be able to push the price down temporarily, but when expiration comes they will find themselves in one hell of a bind when they find out all of the buyers actually have the cash in their accounts to take delivery and refuse to settle in cash.  As the supply of silver dries up and literally there is no way to fulfill the obligations of the long contract holders, the silver futures market will actually be effectively shut down.  The CME will force settle all remaining contracts for cash at the current market rate (which will have spiked dramatically).  This is the last thing the CME wants to do, and will only do it as a final last resort.  If this occurs we can declare victory at having exposed the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.  A futures market is built on the trust that the sellers can actually deliver the product they are selling, and if they can't then that trust is destroyed.  If you go long and they don't have the silver to give you, you will still be paid the money for that amount of silver at the going rate.  Following this collapse the futures market will relaunch at a 1-1 margin requirement.  This means that for every silver ounce sold, the seller will actually have to have the silver or at least the collateral to cover that exact amount of silver on the open market.  The futures market will have moved from 250-1 paper to physical, to 1-1.  The massive banks who were naked short will have lost tens or maybe even hundreds of billions of dollars collectively.  In my previous post I implied it was likely JP Morgan naked shorting.  They have a history of doing so and being fined for manipulation, but we don't actually know which big players are the current naked shorts and who might even be net long.    2.      This is where the rest of us come in...   if you can't play the futures market, you can still purchase and tie up physical silver where the naked shorts can't access it.  Thus setting up the environment for the squeeze to occur.  Whether its WSB players or some other big fund who sees what is happening and does the futures part themselves, they will only be able to do so because of the smaller purchases of silver by millions of smaller players.    Physical silver:   by purchasing physical silver you are taking silver off the market that the shorts will need when the squeeze occurs.  You aren't directly causing the short squeeze, you are helping to set up the environment for the squeeze to occur, and you will have the silver to sell after the squeeze happens.    Silver ETFs (SLV, PSLV, SIVR):   this is the same concept as the physical silver.  By purchasing silver ETFs you are locking up physical into the ETF's vaults, which wont be able to be able to be purchased by the shorts in the futures market because they belong to the ETF shareholders.  There has been a ton of chatter about whether ETFs should be used at all, and of the ETFs which is the best or most reliable.  Frankly if you have doubts about the ETFs, just don't use them.  All of the physical silver is already sold out so this is the easiest way for most people to play at this point.  It is possible that at some point SLV (or other ETFs) will no longer create new shares as silver becomes impossible to find (thus they cant create a new share because they can't the silver to back it up).   At that point the ETFs will likely trade at a hefty premium to NAV and it may no longer make sense to purchase them.  But that hasn't occurred yet so I'd say it still certainly makes sense to buy these ETFs.  We have no proof that they are lying about their silver holdings, and if they disallow new share creation, I'd say that means they really aren't lying about their holdings, otherwise they would happily take as much investment as we would give them to collect management fees.    Call options on Silver ETFs:   Calls will have a similar effect to purchasing the ETFs as the market maker will have to purchase the underlying ETF to be hedged.  It has a levered effect that can both hurt and help the squeeze depending on which direction the silver price is headed.    Miners:   miners will benefit from the squeeze but buying them doesn't help the squeeze occur in any direct way.  People buying miners will benefit if we are successful, but the more capital that flows into them rather than the alternatives, it will lower the chances of the squeeze being successful in the first place.       TLDR:      if monke have lot of money, long futures with no margin and take delivery.      If monke not have lot of money, buy physical silver bullion and silver ETFs    Hopefully this answered some of the questions that flooded my inbox from the previous post.  Good luck to all.  GME and SLV to moon.  Lets squeeze the naked shorts, expose the manipulation, and take our tendies from the hedge funds.

Just buy the stock or Sell your ITM GME calls before they expire
The gamma squeeze pushed the price up a bit last week as a result of MMs buying GME shares to sell to you when your ITM call gets exercised. This just occurred to me that many of you may have had GME calls expire ITM and you now hold 100, 200, 300 etc. shares and have a margin call on your account.  Your broker will sell those shares for you swiftly and that is perfectly legal. This could cause GME to fall quite a bit since the gamma squeeze was the result of MMs having to buy those shares you now own and are being forced to sell.  Lastly, if the price does drop tomorrow because of this very possible and real scenario, DO NOT SELL -    or GTFO.  Edit: Not a financial advisor. I'm an idiot.
I made a stupid fucking song for y'all but I don't know how to post it so Im just gonna put this gif up and maybe you'll listen to it in the comments or some shit but either way fuck robinhood and I love all of you

What‚Äôs happening on wallstreetbets today. Need to refine the code a bit to stop words like BUY and MOON, but you get the gist
I hope next week this post ends up on AgedLikeMilk, but until then, don't be a bagholder..
EDIT: thanks for the add to r/ControversialClub. Apparently this is the most controversial post on reddit in the last hour. Yay.  EDIT 2: Everyone commenting emotionally charged oppositions to my opinion, please post proof of your current GME cost basis with your angry comment.  #Why is every bearish speculative view on GME now considered Melvin propoganda? Check my fucking post history, dipshits. I'm allowed to have a bearish short term outlook for a stock that I'm long term bullish on especially when my initial cost basis is probably 1/10 what yours is.  1. Constantly moving price targets alone is a huge indicator that were topping a crest.  In the last 1 month I've seen the price target move from $240-$500 to a "serious" $10,000/shr..  2. This sub is FILLED with emotional trading which is the complete opposite of what WSB was founded on. It's all about the money and it's ALWAYS been all about the money. Cry me a river about unfairness... The market was "rigged" when the money printers were going brrrrr back in may and WSB was made up of 90% people WHO WERE SHORTING THE ENTIRE ECONOMY.  3. The amount of people with outdated news at this stage in the game will show you who the bagholders will be. They weren't quick enough to jump on the band wagon at $40/shr, what makes them think they'll be able to perfectly time a single (or half) day event?  4. Mr. Shrek (the one and only posterchild and ACTUAL WSB mod) is short term bearish on GME and doesn't even hold a position. And he's locked up and talking through a contact. That should tell you something about the current bagholders.  TL;DR don't be a shoe shine boy. There's a psychological reason that the ones who are slowest to jump aboard are the ones left holding the bag.    ;DRTTLDR:  Keep diamond handing you guys, give time for the bigger positions to exit before you take your profit!  üëäüèΩ        John Galt, if you're out there, I'm waiting for my invite.  The hedgefund guys are billionares. If there's one thing they know how to do, it's make money with legal/illegal/immoral practices. If you're not willing to stoop to that level, then you're at a disadvantage.     I think    we're in the greater fool stage. Maybe you'll be able to sell if the stock opens at $500 OR maybe you'll eat shit if it gaps down to $200. Either way, you need a plan, and that plan should not include the word "hope". What gain/loss are you willing to take; whats the mathematical probability that will happen; and what are you going to do about it whichever way it goes?.  Disclaimer: I'm not a financial expert. I sold   of my 456 share GME position last week. All of my views are speculation and everything I say is rhetorical and by no means financial advice.
Its not much, buy I had to pull over, to get some GME on Wednesday before the restrictions hit.
May have been early but...
Aight go ahead and downvote me for being WSB's resident negative nancy, but this needs to be said: buying GME shares does not hurt hedge funds, or the 1%, and it's dangerous to keep pretending it does
Look, I get it. It's fun to pretend that we're making money  and  dEsTrOyInG tHe 1%, but it isn't based in reality.  Yes, some hedge funds are short on GME. Melvin Capital, in particular, is massively fucked. Which is hilarious.  But, who is long? Let's take a look:  >The 10 largest shareholders/owners of GME are:  >- Fidelity Management & Research   (9,534,090 shares) >- RC Ventures LLC (Ryan Cohen)   (9,001,000 shares) >- BlackRock Institutional   (7,897,907 shares) >- The Vanguard Group, Inc.	  (5,288,116) >- Susquehanna International Group, LLP   (4,444,128 shares) >- Dimensional Fund Advisors,     (3,948,114 shares)	 >- Senvest Management, LLC   (3,610,740 shares)	 >- Foss (Donald A)   (3,515,200 shares) >- State Street Global Advisors (US)   (2,609,487 shares)	 >- Sherman George E Jr   (2,361,670 shares)  That right there is 75% ownership. And if you looked at the next top 10 investors, it would be more wealthy investors and hedge funds.   Of course, not all of these are hedge funds and 1% investors. Some are mutual funds (  Fidelity and Vanguard), so some of these shares are "owned" by the working/middle class in various retirement accounts and similar. But, it's pretty obvious, as  all companies are majority owned by the 1% and hedge funds.  That's how it works.   It's impossible to know exactly what % is owned by retail investors/redditors in brokerage accounts, but it's obvious that it's a tiny, tiny portion.  So, what happens we we boost GME? Well, Melvin Capital gets fucked (again, hilarious), and their wealth is essentially transferred to those who own GME shares. Which is... mostly other hedge funds and wealthy investors. So, we're not transferring wealth from the rich to the poor, we're transferring wealth from rich fucks to... other rich fucks.  And, sure, redditors are skimming a little off the top, and that's great, but it's not a notable amount, in the grand scheme of things. And, if GME crashes, it's gonna be redditors who hold the bags, and the hedge funds will win again (more than they already are).  So, what's my point? Is it to shit on a movement? Am I a CoRpArAtE sHiLl sent by a melvin bro to knock down the stock? No (I wish).   My point is this: whenever some bad news or fake news comes out about GME (  when it was falsely reported that Melvin exited), everyone was 100% sure it is manipulation by Melvin Capital (and the wall street bros). And, it probably was.  But, when some good news comes out (like how we're DESTROYING THE 1% or a billboard in times square), absolutely  no one  considers the possibility that the hedge funds and 1% investors that own gamestop are trying to trick you into buying GME shares. And that's dangerous.  This movement has caused millions of brand new investors to make robinhood accounts and buy GME shares, and  they don't know what they are doing.  They believe that pumping a stock owned by the 1% is somehow a moral battle against the rich, because everyone is telling them so. That's not only wrong, it's also dangerous.  So, go ahead and downvote me, idgaf. Facts are facts, and I advice new traders to not  only  consider downward manipulation, but to also consider upward manipulation. Because you better believe that there are more rich fucks long on GME than short, and they  love this movement.  And they desperately want you to buy shares.  Be careful.

An in-depth analysis of what would happen if we all held GME (updated)
In the near not so distant future‚Ä¶  You leave the theatre that you brought your wife and her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs girlfriend to. The newly built $1 trillion dollar AMC Theatre is dope af .  As you walk custom made Tesla (codenamed Model G), in the corner of your eye you see your old workplace. You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you head across the street to reminisce about the old life you left behind. You think to yourself  wow   Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.   As you enter your previous 9-5 abode, you smirk as you say to yourself¬† Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs. ¬†That joke just never gets old. You immediately recognize the server. You used to hate him but that hatred has now turned to pity.¬† Ah I‚Äôll throw him a bone ¬†you think to yourself as you give Andrew the secret hand signal to meet you out back for the Wendy‚Äôs Special.  You go out back to your usual spot but notice there‚Äôs a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says¬† It‚Äôs $42,069 for a handie . Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god‚Ä¶ has he really not covered his short position yet? After some haggling you managed to get the price down to one silver bar. You take out your other phone, the Nokia G420 SLV Edition as payment but Andrew snatches it away from you. He throws your phone to the man in the dumpster and they both make a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man‚Äôs shirt which read ‚ÄúMelvin Capital‚Äù.  You shake your head as you take out your BB to tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin.¬† Impressive ¬†you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX. GothamX blasted a non-lethal laser developed by Tesla from a SpaceX satellite using the pinpoint accurate latitudes and longitudes provided by Palantir.¬† What a technological marvel ¬†you think to yourself. This was the only DD that you needed.    Perfect timing . Your self driving Tesla Model G comes back after sending your wife and her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs girlfriend home. You submit your market order for 10,000x contracts of Palantir & Tesla FD‚Äôs, you just really like those stonks. You get in your Tesla and head home. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.  TLDR: $GME
GME     ‚úäüèø
Alright here‚Äôs a sports analogy for you apes that might like sports but are still struggling to understand what‚Äôs happening with $GME.
This might get deleted. I know this sub is getting absolutely bombarded with random hot takes and DD‚Äôs, but I‚Äôm hoping this might be an analogy that helps a lot of people understand GME and the squeeze that‚Äôs happening, and will be unique enough to stay.    If you‚Äôre still struggling to understand the squeeze, shorting and the $GME trends, I‚Äôm here to help. Bear with me. (No, not that bear).   This is gonna be really oversimplified, but be different than   and  .  So, imagine a college star, up and coming high draft pick. Most sports are apt for this analogy, but NFL works best.    This is a QB projected #1 pre-season. He‚Äôs legit. bona-fide, undeniable talent. Let‚Äôs call him Game Stop, (Stop, #69).   He‚Äôs on a shit team and gets dealt a shit hand for 2020 (bad team + pandemic. Limits games played, falling off the radar).   Now let‚Äôs a few things happen:   1.) Someone makes a massive bet that Game Stop is washed, terrible and will never recover, but they have to borrow money to make that bet. They hate the player because they‚Äôre old and resentful and afraid of death, and they want to do everything they can to prevent this young player from succeeding. They want to force them to fail by making everyone else believe they will fail.   2.) A new head coach gets hired, someone who is absolutely qualified and primed to bring out the absolute best in Game Stop, and revolutionize and evolve their game.   3.) A random dude on the internet notices how high the bet is against the player, Game Stop. They think to themselves, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve seen that dude play. His talent is undeniable, and he‚Äôs got the perfect new coach. There is no WAY he‚Äôs gonna be that bad‚Äù.   4.) This dude let‚Äôs his buddies know about how high the bet against the player, Game Stop, is, and they agree. There is no WAY they‚Äôre that bad, especially with the new coach! There‚Äôs no way this bet can win, this is easy money!  5.) Word about the bet spreads like wildfire. Not only do more and more people do their research and watch game tape and realize how talented the player is, they realize how insane the bet against him is.   Now, Game Stop (#69) starts to get back on track. They start playing games again and show their potential, their talent. They‚Äôre making a playoff run. Now they‚Äôre gaining more and more attention, and MORE people realize they‚Äôre gonna succeed.   The original person who bet against the player, who was convinced they were washed, starts to panic. The person they borrowed the money from is starting to see what‚Äôs going on, and starts to ask for the money back. Every game that Game Stop plays, they prove themselves more and more, and the bet against them gets even more spicy. At this point, the bettor borrows even more money and DOUBLES DOWN, stubborn and convinced the player will fail and prove they were right.   People aren‚Äôt having it. They‚Äôve SEEN the games, they KNOW the talent, there is absolutely no way this player isn‚Äôt legit, no possible way for them to fail. They bet even more in support. They KNOW he‚Äôll succeed, make the playoffs and win the c  and be the #1 pick.   At this point, the person who bet against him is losing an insane amount of money. There is no way they can pay back the original bet. They‚Äôll be absolutely ruined and embarrassed. Somehow, they have enough power to stop the player from playing games. They take the games off TV, they  delete the highlight videos, they go to the news screaming ‚ÄúThis player is terrible. Trash, washed. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt believe that is delusional, wrong, and will lose a lot of money‚Äù.  It doesn‚Äôt matter, everyone has already seen the games, the highlights, the talent, with their OWN EYES. It‚Äôs undeniable. The bet is terrible, and the new coach fits perfectly.   Every single day the bettor doesn‚Äôt cut his losses, the person he borrowed from adds interest to the total they owe. They‚Äôre getting impatient and they see the writing on the wall. BUT, if they wanna continue, that‚Äôs fine, the bettor will just have to pay even more money at the end.   That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at now. Exactly that.   All it comes down to now, is all of us believing what we‚Äôve already known, what we‚Äôve already seen. They can take down the videos, they can blackout the media, they can keep them from even playing a game, but it‚Äôs too late. WE‚ÄôVE SEEN IT. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THE TALENT, THE COACH, AND HOW BAD THE BET IS.   All we have to do is believe in ourselves, and trust in the talent we‚Äôve seen, and stick to our guns about how terrible the bet against the player was. Every moment that goes by, every game they play, the bet gets worse, and our position gets better.   No matter what, the original better has to call it quits and take their losses, but they will do EVERYTHING they can to make us stumble, falter, fear. To make us doubt ourselves and what we‚Äôve seen, what we know. They can‚Äôt.    We watched this player in elementary school, in middle school, in high school, and college. They brought us countless moments of joy, and sometimes of sadness. We lost with them, but more importantly, we WON with them. How fucking DARE someone bet against them and their talent, and intentionally try to ruin their career, just out of spite, to make a profit.   We know this player, we trust this player, we like this player, we believe in this player, and if we hold this player, by fucking God this player and everyone who believed in them, will win. We‚Äôll succeed.   And that son of a bitch who tried to ruin them? They lose everything.    ü§ö

Unpopular Opinion: I‚Äôm staying with Robinhood
#Obligatory FUCK Robinhood and Vlad for regulating this shit. I myself have 50 shares at $120.  I‚Äôll get downvoted back to Lumbridge, but there‚Äôs no second thought to go to another brokerage.  #Here‚Äôs my reasons:  1.   The BEST UI out there.   It completely eliminated the learning curve for fundamental training. I started trading in November 2020, and have reaped 200% gains in 3 months. If I had picked a legacy, more complex boomer brokerage, I‚Äôd probably be in boomer ass SPY / VOO type index funds due to being mentally handicapped. 2.   This shit runs deeper than Robinhood.   remember when big guns shorted airplane/defense stocks right before 9/11? Who‚Äôs really in control here? These brokerages limiting trading certain stocks are the puppets being manipulated by some greater master. 3.   Early access to their IPO.   everyone leaving to Fidelity will force their hand to offer a shit ton more shares to users pre-IPO. Let‚Äôs be fucking honest here, this stock is going apeshit to mars. GME is just the current trend. There are new investors everyday and Robinhood will still remain the go-to with its referral incentives and ease-of-use.  Go ahead and crucify me. I just can‚Äôt stand any other UI and RH makes the P&L easy.
Explanation of the supposed shorts closing, and SI shares vs price graph
S3 Partners posted this.  The key thing to note on ~~2~~1/26 and 1/27. There you can see that while shorts  supposedly  closed and became lower the price also dropped at the same time.  This doesn't make sense. Shorts closing  should  mean more shares being bought thus driving the price up.  Note the date.   Wednesday.   This was also happening during the short ladder manipulation. It's more likely that a lot more shares were "borrowed" (shorted) from already shorted shares to create that short ladder manipulation, but they weren't disclosed.  Note: Assumes I'm interpreting the tweet correctly and S3 Partners isn't already taking this into account for the only 4 million SI drop.

Lots of talk about naked short selling lately
I thought to bring up a little history in light of all the nss talk as of late. Payrick Byrne, ex ceo of overstock, waged this battle about 15yrs ago. Got called a looney by wall street but fought through it and won some parting gifts. Interestingly, one guy he accused was Steve Cohen. At the time he ran SAC hedgefund (named after him Stephen A Cohen). Eventually got busted for insider trading and had to close shop with only about 10b. Bought the mets and now reopened shop with another hf, Point 42 or something like that. The guy that started Melvin was a SAC prot√©g√© and I think Steve floated them some money on that last bailout. Anyways, might be interesting to parse the past a little and head down the rabbit hole.       Edit: byrne is an interesting fellow. Son of Jack Byrne, former ceo of Geico and a Buffet favorite. Phd in philosophy from Stanford. He walks a fine line btwn sanity and insanity as some of his stories makes him look bat shit crazy. That said, I think he was on the right side of history with his fight against Naked Short Selling  Edit: one of the most inspirational thing I've ever read was from a speech he gave on his battle with cancer back in 2006 ish. It was removed from the original site for some reason but someone copied it here

Retarded question about AMC options help me clear this up!!!
I've been looking at the AMC $14 call options from Feb 14th to Jan 15th. They don't have that much of a range, maybe a dollar at most. Some of the further out options are even lower than say the Sept 14th that currently has a   -   bid-ask.   My question is if I were going to buy the Match 5th option that has a   spread, shouldn't i just get the January 21 2022 option that has a   spread because they're so close in price and the Jan 2022 has much more time so I wouldn't get hit with that theta bang?
Drawing with crayons (update and prediction)
I believe The market is going to crash and the media is framing the narrative with big money to blame WSB. i saw the headline trying to get WSB to sell or the market will crash. forget the implications that a few retards could bring the world economy to its knees. I want to put this out there prior to anything happening in hopes of possibly helping my fellow smooth brains in the event i am correct. If this happens WSB had nothing to do with it the pattern has been forming since before most of you started trading.  After mixed reviews and some interest in my dms, I thought I would put a time table to my theory and possibly earn some Nostradamus style prophetic infamy or go down in a blaze of glory.  I believe SPX/SPY has created the largest three peaks and a dome house chart pattern ever seen. Typically these patterns are seen over a period of months, but, I believe this has been forming for years. I am predicting a severe economic downturn with a depression.        The above chart shows the current 5 year SPX chart compared to an example of a past three peaks and a dome house pattern. Based on this March was not a crash but a signal of what's to come. As you can see if i am correct this will be the only time in history this pattern has occurred over a timeframe this large. I am not screaming the sky is falling, but facts point to the very likely possibility. 6/10 of the largest market rallies were during the great depression and 2/10 were during the 08 crisis. this is no different.  Timing        The above is the current spy chart over a 5 year period. I am operating under the theory that in april we entered the deflationary spiral seen in depressions, through fed intervention, stimmys, and other market factors we have yet to see the full brunt. My prediction is that the market will rally a bit over the next 2-3 weeks, and then begin its descent with the large drop coming in 4-6 weeks. This can be affected by an infinite amount of factors which could accelerate or prolong the pattern. According to pattern, we will see new ATH or near it on SPX then we will go down.     I want to be extremely clear, I am just like you in the worst possible ways. I successfully pattern trade, but i am in no way a professional. This is not financial advice, i am simply sharing something i believe i came across to benefit the retards i love arguing with. Feedback is welcomed and  i look forward to arguing with all of you.

Now imagine Hedge Fund A & B betting on the outcome of Citadel winning it's short position. Then imagine Hedge Fund B & C betting on the outcome of A & B being right on their position on citadel. So on and so forth. Now imagine this house of cards toppling because Shitadel wasn't right. Scared yet?
If you all don't understand synthetic CDO's please watch this first. Selena Gomez is a babe and you retards will actually learn something for once in your miserable lives.  Now, why should this scare you? Imagine a financial system full of Chads. These Chads got greedy, just like they did before, and let's be real, Chad's don't learn their lessons. These same Chads didn't just short one stonk,   GameStop, these factory reject dildos shorted pretty much everything. Refer to the list of stocks with short percents above 60%. That's why it's not just GME that's being squeezed, it's BB, it's NOK, it's FIZZ, it's MAC, it's every single highly shorted stock because these Chads just realized that they have to cover their pasty asses from being completely obliterated.  The thing about these Chads though is they convinced Brett, Cody, Kevin & Pauly, the yacht owning, sperry and plaid short wearing dude bros that their shorts were smart. So what did these upside down Greek Symbols do? They bet on the outcome of the Chads being right.  Taking a short position that was initially a few billion dollars and sending into val-fucking-halla. Am I saying that this will cause the financial system to collapse? Absolutely no because Jerome Powell hallowed be his name will make the money printer go brrrr. But this is going to correct the system like we've never seen before.

(Mods please don't remove this post; it's pretty important)  tldr: Want to keep your tendies? Then read this post.  First   of all, $10k isn't a meme            BUY AND HOLD   ü§≤  ü§≤    ü§≤. Also, fuck Robincrooks. Go to a real broker to buy shares like  Fidelity, TD, etc.  Since the short squeeze maybe around the corner I am just posting as a reminder to all the fellow soldiers in this war against the shorts.    of us are making money we haven't seen in our lives, and some of us haven't invested at all.  This euphoria may make people forget the that...   Uncle Sam wants his cut.üíµüá∫üá∏     I know this gets mentioned in the comments but we can forget when we see the share price rocket, so this needs to be reiterated over and over. Also, I don't want anyone to get fucked next April because they forgot about some boring shit like taxes and income brackets.    The IRS DOES NOT fuck around. The IRS is basically Liam Neeson in Taken -- "If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue  you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.‚Äù     They will find you and take what is theirs.  Remember, your gains will cover your taxes so set aside money for it when you cash out.    How much you need to set aside depends on the state you live in and how much you make/made. So, please find out how much you need to set aside BEFORE you starting using the tendies!     If you live in a no income tax state like Texas or Washington, then great you get to keep more money, but you still have to pay federal income tax.     Please don't be a retard and invest it back in because you can lose it.     Put it in a savings account, let it sit as cash in your brokerage account, or withdraw it and stuff it under your mattress (the worst idea but to   each their own)   If you want to invest, then invest your other profits minus the tax money.     If you are a dependent, then please talk to your parents/guardians.    (   Realistically this mostly pertains to college students because anyone under 18 years can't open a brokerage on their own. But if your parents/guardians don't  know and you are under 18, then please talk to them.)       Most important for moving up in income brackets (PLEASE FUCKING READ IT):Some people will be jumping income tax brackets, and will be out of the low-income thresholds.     If this you think this will be you and you are currently getting low-income benefits like medi-cal, food s , etc. Please set aside money to pay for healthcare if you aren't getting any from your work.  Okay boring tax reminder set aside...   This next part is for the college students that are going to make bank, because I know there are a few.     Some of you autists are college students and are getting FAFSA or some need-based financial aid.    Make sure you aren't going to fuck yourself out of financial aid    because some of you WILL be fucking yourself out of financial aid and I hope you have a plan for it by working or applying for scholarships.  Colleges will be the ones eating your tendies; if you lose financial aid and don't have a plan.  Why I say some is because FAFSA only looks at prior taxes so next year's FAFSA will ask for 2020 taxes but tendies are coming in 2021 so you have one year of financial aid before FAFSA asks for 2021 taxes which is going to fuck you hard.Technically if you are graduating in 2023 you will be fine, I think, because the 2022-2023 FAFSA application will open in Oct 2021 so it will ask for 2020   are other questions about how much money have invested, in checking/saving accounts, and what not, but FAFSA really cares about your adjusted gross income which will be high because we are leaving this fucking solar system    )  2023-2024 FAFSA application will ask for 2021 taxes, so if you think you are going to be applying for financial aid for those years, then please have a plan ready.    Again, please make sure you find out everything IMMEDIATELY AFTER cashing in for the tendies!!    I am not a financial advisor, or CPA. \ insert whatever legal disclaimer here\   I am posting this as a reminder so my fellow  ü§≤ so don't get fucked over.  edit: I wrote don't invest back in -- I meant don't invest the tax money back in because once you cash that shit is taxed.
Now CNN Spreading Lies About Us and SLV
AMC TO PLUTO
Get ahead of the Mainstream Media narrative now while you all have the upper hand.
As many of you know, the system will use the full might of the Mainstream Media to blame you all for what is going to happen; what was inevitable to happen as a result of fiat funny money and criminal Wall Street fuckery. Notice how even Jim Cramer who was playing the "good guy" initially now is saying "ok guys, time to pack it up and sell."? They are in full panic mode and their only shot of having control is to shift blame from them to you.   The Federal Reserve Cartel has been printing dollars into oblivion. The average normie does not understand the everything bubble we are in and they do not understand dollar inflation. Thus far I've had to explain what a "short" is to about 5 people who know nothing of whats going on other than what the talking heads on the TV screen are telling them. Because of this it will be very easy for the MSM to convince niave Boomers and others ignorant of the markets and financial terminology that it was "memes and shit posting" by all of us "unsophisticated investors" who are to blame for the economic black swan event unfolding. Their "Problem, reaction, solution" is to make it seem like YOU are the cause of the economic and financial collapse by simply turning their own game on them. The reaction will be the demand for help coming from the normies and mid-wits who are niave and ignorant as to why shit hit the fan. The solution will be "New regulations to make sure this will NEVER happen again!" And thats where they think they will fuck you... Only this time they won't. You must not allow this to become what happened after 9/11 where the problem and solution led to them fucking us over with bullshit unconstitutional laws.   We all know who the real criminals are.  We all know their game.   Make no mistake, all the talking TV heads have their scripts ready and all the politicians and regulators have their "new" laws ready to be signed. They will make sure that only the "sophisticated investors" can invest while they add taxes and regs that will squeeze the little guy out of the markets.   You think AOC supports what happened to Melvin because she's so adept at economics and financial matters? She has an agenda with her band of retards to slip in taxes that will fuck you.   Politics aside, no one in DC is your friend and anyone showing you "support" is only waiting long enough to drive their knife into your backs with regulations and taxes.   And last... If you are buying Silver, BUY PHYSICAL SILVER. DO NOT BUY ETF's, THAT IS HOW THEY WILL FUCK YOU. IF YOU BUY PHYSICAL, THAT IS HOW YOU WILL FUCK THEM. (I'm not a financial advisor, this not financial advise, blah blah blah, don't be a fucking retard, do your due diligence)  How will you get ahead of their pre-planed narrative and "solution" to "the retail investor question"? Let the normies and mid-wits who just parrot whatever they are told know what is really going on by explaining what the Federal Reserve Bank is and what they've done as well as the games these Hedge funds played at bringing us to this unfolding shit storm.

STONKS
There is already an insane amount of mis-info in finance media talking about discussions on this subreddit
Outlets from Bloomberg to FT to Reuters to CNBC are claiming "retail" is piling into silver, as if we had the fucking ability to trade tonight.    even goes as far as to repeat the claims of someone saying ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of commentary on these platforms to pile in to the miners.‚Äù  This is an obvious lie to anyone who bothered to spend 10 seconds looking at the subreddit. Theres either bot shenanigans going on or they are all getting together to push silver, claiming  we  are the ones piling into it when its them.

DDDD - Why GME Might    Next Week, and How It Could Trigger a Financial Crisis
In today's edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we‚Äôll be going over over the details about what happened this week with GME, the drama around Robinhood and other brokers, and take a close look at some data to determine whether or not GME and other various meme / high SI stocks such as AMC, BBBY, FIZZ, LGND, and ~~BB~~ will continue    in its short squeeze this week, and how this all could lead to widespread stock market crash and financial crisis. But first, something to cover my ass for the SEC investigators combing through this Subreddit  Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.  ## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?  There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I‚Äôll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù reason given by Robinhood.     This statement has been  . I personally wouldn‚Äôt believe the Sequoia part since I don‚Äôt really know what they would gain from it - they‚Äôre a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I‚Äôd be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going   this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop‚Äôs short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I‚Äôll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it‚Äôs actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn‚Äôt happen in the first month in office.    Possible intervention from Citadel Securities    This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a  .  Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There‚Äôs also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there.   and do this type of shit.    The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations    Let‚Äôs get to the  , which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently,   Robinhood is running out of cash  , so they weren‚Äôt able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren‚Äôt able to trade through them. Let‚Äôs dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.  Let‚Äôs talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There‚Äôs a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don‚Äôt want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that‚Äôs where the clearing house comes in. Let‚Äôs call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.  Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question (  to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.  ## What‚Äôs Robinhood Going To Do About GME?  Robinhood‚Äôs decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here‚Äôs a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood‚Äôs decision, for fun                  fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood‚Äôs office saying ‚ÄúSuck my nuts Robinhood‚Äù              Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It‚Äôs especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally ‚Äúdemocratize finance‚Äù, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood‚Äôs image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon.   All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO  .  The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we‚Äôve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do,   they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely     \ \ .\ \   ## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash  Let‚Äôs go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history.  , so amazing that I‚Äôll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.  > A children's book explanation of what's happening:    >   > 1. If you are "smart money" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+    >   > 2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well    >   > 3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 "gross" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero   in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.    >   > 4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an "ideas dinner".    >   > 5.

You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.    >   > 14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.      In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are ‚Äúhedged‚Äù by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (  Beta neutral), so they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafer‚Äù. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable ‚ÄúNet Exposure‚Äù, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.  A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN‚Äôs stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would‚Äôve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It‚Äôs very likely that if Robinhood hadn‚Äôt stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the  .    TLDR    In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,  1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME    2. Much of the stock market‚Äôs value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so   if GME (and other common shorts)    the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis     Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it‚Äôs probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it‚Äôll fall below $100.   Or in other words,  .  EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted   and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.
Keep some money away for taxes
Listen up you fucking retards. We all know we‚Äôre buying and holding GME no matter what fucking happens so we can stick it to the hedge funds. But in the midst of this all, I‚Äôm worried about my fellow retards. When the squeeze squozes and you eventually sell (somewhere between $10,000 and $1,000,000 share price) you‚Äôre going to have to pay taxes! Don‚Äôt be one of those morons that makes 100k, spends it all and then has no money to pay 35k in taxes.  We‚Äôre gonna FUCK the hedge funds, but make sure you‚Äôre not fucking yourselves in the process.  GME TO THE MOON
What u think, am I a paper hands bitch?
To no one's surprise, Robinhood will continue its 1 GME share limit tomorrow ü§°
Alright, retards. Tomorrow,   But how can we fuck them back?   For those of us who haven't migrated to a more investor friendly platform, they are still allowing purchase of up to 5 options contracts. There's nothing stopping those of you who like this stock from buying itm contracts and exercising them as soon as you can. Turning a 1 share limit into a 501 share limit.  I'll be   Ô∏è til this wonderful stock hits 100k.  Thank you and fuck Robinhood.        Ô∏è üçÜ  Edit: forgot to call someone a retard  Edit 2: OR just set up an account with fidelity, which can be set up and ready to go instantly. Seriously, avoid robinhoopla if you can. This post is just giving you another option  EDIT 3 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: Anything other than GME is the wrong play. The fact that they're letting you purchase a bunch of other "limited" stocks but only ONE of gamestonk should be a big fat red screaming sign that GME is the winner here. üìà

And that total doesn't include what retail may own.  Since I think there are only supposed to be 69,750,000 shares ever issued how does that make sense?

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) - Sustainable AG
Company: Archer Daniels Midland   Ticker: ADM   Headquarters: Chicago, IL, USA   Market Cap:     Sector: Food Processing   Company Background: Archer-Daniels-Midland Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients in the United States and internationally. The company operates through three segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. It procures, stores, cleans, and transports agricultural raw materials, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley. The company also engages in the agricultural commodity and feed product import, export, and distribution; and structured trade finance activities. In addition, it offers vegetable oils and protein meals; ingredients for the food, feed, energy, and industrial customers; crude vegetable oils, salad oils, margarine, shortening, and other food products; and partially refined oils to produce biodiesel and glycols for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products. Further, the company provides peanuts, tree nuts, peanut-derived ingredients, and cotton cellulose pulp; sweeteners, corn and wheat starches, syrup, glucose, wheat flour, dextrose, and bioproducts; alcohol and other food and animal feed ingredients; ethyl alcohol and ethanol; corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers' grains; and citric acids. Additionally, the company provides natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, and natural health and nutrition products, including probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, and botanical extracts; and other specialty food and feed ingredients; edible beans; formula feeds, and animal health and nutrition products; and contract and private label pet treats and foods. It also engages in futures commission merchant and insurance services. The company has a partnership with Hospital de Sagunto. The company was founded in 1902 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.    Picture so you don't have to read the above wall of text:                     ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction    Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See:    Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.        Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry  Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world‚Äôs largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.  PROS:  \- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.  \- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.  \-   Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.    CONS:  \- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.     # TLDR  \- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)  \- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.  \- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.  \- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the   even the moon     . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.  Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative.      Sorry this isn‚Äôt GME. Remember you can hold more than 1 stock at once, unless you‚Äôre poor.

Trading Limits on Monday to 1 share of GME
I'm angry. I'm utterly furious. I'm absolutely livid.  These CUNTS cannot get away with this. Do you all understand the amount of data mining, mathematical modeling, analysis and general fuckery that has to happen for Robinhood to come up with the exact table in the article? They know the open interest data, they know that if they open the flood gates they will be reamed in their assholes by the almighty Zeus himself so they restrict trades to ONE SHARE.   NO OTHER BROKERAGE FIRM IS DOING THIS. ONE SHARE. This is beyond market manipulation, this is rigging the game against customers who can't transfer shares, money, open accounts, on the weekends.   So be assured there will be shit that goes down on Monday but these clowns are scared. If anyone has watched the scene where Selena Gomez explains CDO's in the Big Short I urge you to commit that fucking scene to memory because we're seeing it all over again.   MOVE TO A DIFFERENT BROKERAGE and goddamit it this IS financial advice. This is America, we do NOT capitulate to financial terrorists.   Edit: Positions: 58 shares of GME @ $213. Obligatory emojis          üèΩ Also, commented this below, but my whole portfolio is with Fidelity and I left Robinhood a long time ago. I hope everyone else does too.
The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fight
If you haven‚Äôt been browsing WSB or doing your own research, you‚Äôd probably think that the people on Twitter are correct in saying there is a silver squeeze happening and we should all get in on it. There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS & the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are.   By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME            The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.  The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in.   If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I‚Äôd recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME.   For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist.   BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO  Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this "squeeze" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a "squeeze" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG  Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla. Look to your left, now look to your right, these are your brethren and sisterthren who will diamond hands with you until we all pass down these tendies to our children's children. Onward.
I joined the fun a little late and had a limited budget to work with, but boy am I glad to be along for the ride with all of you fellow autists! TOMORROW THE  s FOR GME AND AMC TAKE OFF TO THE
Why Robinhood is not the enemy
Robinhood was a great idea for Citadel.  Make a sexy and ‚Äúgamified‚Äù stock trading interface and market it to the masses, then use the data to make better trades.    But somehow I think this beast has gotten away from them.  Suddenly the masses are more interested than ever in the stock market.  They are sharing their ideas and experiences in an open forum and finding out that they are actually in agreement on what stocks to buy.  Here is the problem; hedge funds pay billions of dollars for our data to companies like Robinhood, Facebook, and Mastercard.  They spend billions more on algorithms and the fastest systems just to make trades on companies that WE ARE SUPPORTING.  What value is any of that if you already bought a share of MCD on Robinhood before you even paid for your cheeseburger?  We can suddenly beat them at their own game.  I think the next logical step in this progression is that Robinhood goes down hard, Robinhood users get settlement cuts of a few hundred dollars, and we feel like we really stuck it to the man, but did we?  Robinhood is the best weapon we have right now to arm the lower class with the same weapons as these hedge funds, and they are more than happy to nuke it before we realize.  Sure most out there will move over to other brokers but let‚Äôs face it, other brokers like TD and Fidelity are intimidating to begin trading on, and won‚Äôt encourage the everyday masses to learn more about money.  So feel free to take your money elsewhere and by all means make Vlad and those rich assholes at the top of Robinhood pay.  But ask yourself why Ted Cruz agrees with AOC on going after Robinhood, because he sure as hell doesn‚Äôt care about retail traders.  The very value of everything is being rocked to its core right now.  Hell a currency with a literal endless supply shot up 1000%.  If everyone in our society can make a living swiping their phones all day, maybe Wal-Mart has to pay their employees a bit more or improve their working conditions.   Anyway I just wanted to get these thoughts out there and say be careful where we take this.
I‚Äôve never done anything with stocks before. However, I see change all the time and have always wanted to help bring it about. Even if I only got 3 shares, I‚Äôm proudly able to say, ‚ÄúI did my part.‚Äù
You're bruising each others bananas with market buys on Robinhood meme stocks
What we know:    Robinhood sells its order-book to Citadel   Robinhood is fuk   Citadel is fuk   Hedgefunds are gay   We're all retarded  The man in the little hat is young and thirsty to impress the liver-spotted boomers:   Boomers.  You all have gross dry skin.  The apes want bananas.  They are rattling their cages repeatedly yelling "buy banana" until their throats bleed.  When we ask them how much they want to spend they just reply with "monke want banana!"  We can fuck them in their pink little baboon asses and punish them for what they did to us with $GME.   The boomers go wild, coughing and scratching their eczema in excitement.  They know what you want.  They know you'll pay anything for it.  You drove the price of $BB up to $30 in a banana-hungry rage, and as soon as you let off the gas the price has returned back to $14.  This tells you everything:  The stock isn't heavily shorted, this wasn't a squeeze, they were just answering high demand by manipulating you into over-paying.  I buy the DD, I love $BB, but it's not a 7-day play and the price is way too fucking high.   . It's a 6+ months play and the returns are going to be 5-10% per earnings report at best, not rocket-leap 100% jumps.  You have to be patient: fuel the ship, calibrate the boosters, load the cargo and only then can you prepare for your trip to mars.  Give $BB time to build the biodome so you can land safely.   Don't hand the hedges and banks extra undeserved banana tokens.  WHAT DO YOU:    Delete Robinhood & get a real broker   Never place another market order   If you just love the stock, buy it   Strap on your seatbelts we're going to the moon  I say this about $BB but it's true about the others.  Don't let them manipulate you!  $BB MOON       (eventually)  Edit: Added the info about insider trading, this is the basis for my criticism of $BB value right now.

Why I feel a little bad for DFV
Hear me out, I'm sure he will be wiping his tears with his millions of dollars about this, but...     If you watch his videos you can tell that he genuinely loves investing, researching stocks to find deep value, and putting his bull thesis together. While profit is amazing and it is awesome to be correct, many of us that have been doing this for a while do it to chase that dragon. If we get a play right, we just go on to find our next play and the cycle repeats. We love researching companies to find that diamond in the rough company that is way undervalued.      Now that so much focus and international spotlight is on DFV, I would imagine that he will be very hesitant to share his new finds for fear that if he posts something on here pointing out a new possible play that people will just flock to that stock with any DYOR. Just the fact that he has been quiet last week (outside of his daily position screenshots), tells me that he is being very careful about what he shares.
SEC, DOJ, 60 Minutes ‚Äì Public data suggests massive securities fraud in which hedge funds and institutions have created more Gamestop shares than actually exist for delivery
Obligatory emoji      Short Version:   The short version is that a review of the   'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'   data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.  There are are   71 million shares   of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than   102,000,000   shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.  On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).    Once you include call options,   retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)  . This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.     Long Version:   A more detailed analysis by /u/johnnydaggers is here.

Mathamatically were they able to dump a bunch of shorts during Thursday when trading was haulted and there was a lag in the indicator? Or did they unload them illegally? Did they unload some during the short ladder attack?  Is there such thing as an option short ladder attack? did they do that?     Just pondering over here... Someone truly autistic help.

My GameStop winning strategy...
I am not a financial analyst or business analyst in any way. In no way should this be taken as advice by anyone or acted on in any way. I am, however, a stock-trading gamer who is currently sipping Pinot while writing this up for your wife's boyfriend to read on the toilet later tonight, all because of the $GME gains.     Haha gotcha. HOLD! Sorry, Musk, but once my shares head into space the only thing you are gonna be able to brag about is that you land spent rockets on sea platforms.     GameStop is still a viable company. Make me CEO (or at the very least a VP of some sort) because my Pinot-drinking ass has some baller ass ideas.     (1) GameStop needs to start an active   with gamers protesting our inability to physically own property that we purchased. When I bought  Legend of Zelda  in its sweet metallic cartridge, I was able to sensuously rub my fingertips along the¬†gold cartridge,¬†savoring the pattern of oily smudges my¬†callused hands left. I was able to trade it or sell it to someone, not to mention smell it. There was value in the game beyond just playing it. I could even sell it to GameStop for a whole dollar if I so chose.¬†  GameStop needs to be louder about this.     Pok√©mon card collecting is still going strong. Folks are chasing physical cards, but what they are not doing is jumping to use the online codes shoved into each pack. Those are meaningless compared to the cards themselves. There is still a lot of demand for physical property, and this can be observed by thousands of gamers who wait in line for physical disk releases, many of whom are paying extra for ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô versions of their game.     (1a) GameStop can use this buzz to make agreements with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo (and others of course) to allow them to sell ‚Äòownable‚Äô versions of digital games. Yes, digital is nice and convenient, but do I own my copy? Can I trade it or sell it for a different game? Allow us to do this with digital copies and GIVE THE POWER BACK TO THE PLAYERS. GameStop can step in and buy back and resell digital keys on their website.     (2) GameStop needs to become involved in sponsorship of competitive gaming. HEAVILY! They should have a goal to become the go-to name in that rising sport. Why can‚Äôt they host competitions with buy-ins and payouts similar to professional poker tournaments? Why think of the GameStop brand as a simple brick-and-mortar retailer? Amazon sold books, for shit‚Äôs sake, now they are selling everything cheap East-Asian labor can produce while at the same time hosting web services. The sky's the limit.     That's all I've got for now. I see three possible outcomes to this post: downvoted or disappeared into the dark void of Reddit new¬†(most likely); a series of shit posts about my wine (what are you degenerates drinking? Don't talk to me about your whiskey dicks); or, my personal preference, a running list of ‚Äò$GME go burrr‚Äô and ‚ÄòHOLD‚Äô responses. To the moon, babies.  PS: George Sherman, if you are reading this, DM me... I cum cheap.
This is the conclusion of an SEC report on counterfeiting shares, dated September 17th, 2008
"Certain market participants, trading illegally, appear to be making a concerted effort to take down some of the most important financial institutions in the United States. Who would counterfeit shares of these vital   institutions to cause their financial collapse without regard for the   citizens? It is not possible to carry out this massive fraud without the cooperation of large Wall Street firms and regulatory complicity, indifference or lack of competence. Some firms are blatantly selling shares that do not exist.  25 It is impossible to ward off the downward price pressure from counterfeit shares diluting a company‚Äòs value. The entire nation‚Äòs value is diminished when the counterfeiting of securities is  . Simply put, this is a defining moment in the history of the financial strength of the United States. Other than home ownership assets, the largest   household assets are tied to the stock market through retirement accounts. If counterfeiting continues, investment and retirement accounts will be backed by nothing but counterfeit shares, which they may already be holding in substantial amounts. To conceal the fraud perpetrated on the retirement accounts is simple, manipulate the markets to crash. The money previously plundered from these accounts remain in the hands of the counterfeiters and the statements sent by the Wall Street firms to retirement investors will reflect a crashed market value of their assets,  , you lost your retirement savings. The counterfeiting of   traded securities is nothing less than a fraud of epic proportions. As with other illegal stock market activity, offshore shell companies are a likely depository of the ill-gotten gains. While   citizens would like to trust that government regulators are putting the citizens first and protecting investors, this may not be the case. The ownership and trading irregularities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac discussed above, seem so obvious, that surely our government would have taken the steps necessary to protect investors in these very important financial institutions from fraud in the market. Unfortunately, the facts do not support that the government did enforce the securities laws against fraud and market manipulation. It is necessary for the United States to do everything within its power to recover the enormous amount of monies that have been plundered from this country and its citizens. Bring the few illegal dealers responsible for counterfeiting stock to justice in order to assure that this United States economic disaster will never repeat itself. There is simply too much at stake to do otherwise."     Thought that this should be shared as it gives insight into what is happening today, including the fact that the SEC is aware of it but doing nothing.

Americans: taxes on tendies
Have been seeing a lot of posts on taxes without details on what/where you owe (and confused apes in the comments). Here are the basics (not a professional cpa; just someone offering some basic advice):  If you are trading in a tax-exempt account (IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc): congratulations, you don‚Äôt have to worry about taxes on your tendies (at least for now)  If you are trading in a standard brokerage account, keep reading:  1) if you bought and sold a stock for a profit within 365 days,  the profit is considered short term capital gains. However, all cap gains/losses are considered together (write off losses against gains).   Example: you bought $10k GME Jan 1. Sold GME in April (diamond hands) for $1,000,000. That is $990k profit. Now if you decided you‚Äôve had enough for the year and ride off into the sunset, you owe taxes on the $990k. The tax rate will depend on other income you have. It is taxed as regular income tax. Look up your marginal tax rates for state and federal income tax for your situation (ie married filing jointly would pay lower taxes vs single). Rule of thumb: set aside 40% (usually will be more than enough).   Example 2: However let‚Äôs say you are regarded and try to gamble it all on options in July 2021. Sadly, your $990k is a total loss. Congrats. You have no net gains/losses. You owe no additional taxes.   Example 3: you are even more regarded and gamble your original investment of $10k hoping to make it back. You lose that too. Now that counts as a net loss for the year of -$10k. Well that sucks. But at least you can deduct $3k of it from your regular income (and carry the other $7k over to be deducted in future years). Note, this does not mean you get $3k back. It means if your income is $50k, you now get to deduct $3k and pay income tax on $47k.   2) now, if you bought GME Jan 1 and missed the squoze and finally decide to sell in February 2022 for a reasonable gain of $2,000, you have now achieved one of the rich ppl cheat codes for taxes.  That $2k will be taxed at the long-term cap gains rate for tax year 2022. For 2020 tax year, those tax brackets (single filers) are 0% if your total income is less than $40k, 15% for income between 40 and 440k, and 20% if over that). Note there may also be a state cap gains tax as someone mentioned CA‚Äôs is 13-14% (please confirm for your state). If you have other losses, you can write those off against the gains same as before.   Also tip: all of this is SUPER easy to do in TurboTax. TurboTax automatically links to most big name brokerage accounts and all the calculations of what sold when for how much at what cost basis is done automatically. It‚Äôs super easy to use even you apes can use it. If you have a simple tax situation (eg just your tendies and your regular 9-5), just go with TurboTax. They also have a pro version where you can speak to a cpa if you need help.       365 days for short term depends on holding period for asset but yes basically this + 1 day for stocks (ie buy Jan 1, 2021.. sell before Jan 2, 2022, it is short term)   Edit to add: potential state cap gains taxes Edit correction on losses  Edit correction on the correction. Original post correct.
Stress Management In Planning
HOLD     ##NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION  I am not well versed in stocks, but I am very experienced with high stress situations. This is particularly  true with planned out high stress scenarios where after running through a plan a million times, I have to live with the idea in my head for hours or days prior to execution.   The only way I stay sane, is I make a plan I can live with, get to know it inside and out, and forget about it.       The advanced knowledge of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and dangerous situation ahead can do a motherfucking number on anyone's cognition. What is most important is to not allow fear or emotion change the way a problem is approached. There is a    reason    why the plan was made prior, in the calm. Remember, we are dumb-ass    figuratively and quite literally.       Everything you do should be done with calm intent.   That means, if you planned to hold no matter what,   DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.   If you plan to buy more, set your limits below market to help attack the short ladders when they come and   DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.   If you plan to ~~sell~~ buy, set your limits and   DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.   If the mechanisms of execution have already been decided, why waste precious head space doubting the plan? Go have a    if tempted to peek.     The moment a plan is changed based on emotion without vetted, new information is a mistake   of the time. In this case, having an open mind during the trading day is a bad idea. The time for open-mindedness was the day prior, while peacefully eating oatmeal or Teddy Grahams. Allowing a plan to be adjusted without reason is terrible in life and in STONKS.     Problem solving works by changing one variable and observing the results. If a plan is changed several times during the course of execution it will be hard to discern where mistakes were made. This makes improvement very hard, and sometimes impossible.     ###TL;DR   Make your own plan, ask yourself if you can accept the positive or negative outcome, and FUCKING STICK TO IT.   No matter the outcome, you will be more peaceful internally and more able to make better choices next time. Calm   > Panicked       ###$GME for the $PEOPLE, HOLDING MY 148 SHARES AND SETTING BUY ORDERS FOR MONDAY MADNESS.

Why WSB is now running the entire equity market   - Investment Professional here
I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica.   I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast   End Game   with Grant William.  This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.      GME Misconceptions    The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.  The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt.     Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds    If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value.   The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these "evil" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis.     What Happens Next    The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before.   If the market does crash, congress may blame this on "reckless speculators" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end.   I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.
Unpopular $GME DD
Before I start, let me just say that I am all about the $GME train and hope it is a 1-way trip to Uranus for all those holding with diamond hands. I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.  Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable ‚Äì the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.  If you look at $GME‚Äôs articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.  Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.  So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).  Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesn‚Äôt want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin‚Äô Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably won‚Äôt issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.  All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.   üåñüåñüåñüåñ  Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK.           Let‚Äôs hope the $GME board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly!!!!!    üåñ  Edit 1: Tl;dr I predict         üåñ, but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely.  Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a ‚Äú20% Rule‚Äù which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well. There are some exceptions to this, but no one wants to read more about this.

Why YOU should leave Robinhood (because I can't)
Lots of Robinhood talk, of course. Here's the dilemma a lucky/unlucky few are facing and why you should help.   I, like several others, turned a joke YOLO into a fortune. Like $5k to $200k in a few weeks. Cool. And now I'm stuck.   If I transfer my shares and options to, say, Fidelity, I lose a week where my shares are locked. Oh, I'll still be able to watch my stock go up and down in Robinhood, but I won't be able to sell anything. That's normal and not shady, it's exactly how any broker would handle it. And under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an issue.   But these are obviously not normal times. Anyone want to lock up their account for the next week and watch what happens, unable to do anything? No. If we hit the moon and everyone sells by Friday, I'll be lucky to get access to my shares the following Monday. Just in time for this thing to come back to earth.   I could sell everything I have in Robinhood, but that still takes me out for a few days, since the funds need to settle that day, plus 2 additional days. Then, I can send the $ to a different broker. Even if that last part is instant, we're still talking about over 2 days. Again, anyone want to bet on where we'll be in 2 days. If I sell at $300 and this thing makes it to $700 by Tuesday, I'm fucked if I try to buy back in on Wednesday.   And don't forget - if I sell my options and shares, I give them to the shorts, which hurts everyone.   So what to do? Well, I'm obviously stuck for now. But you CAN help. If you're in Robinhood and not in my situation, you can leave ASAP.   Robinhood is restricting buying GME again tomorrow, so you can't get it there anyway. If you want to buy, switch to Fidelity or Vanguard or someone and buy there. On top of that, if Robinhood is 100% innocent (  HUGE   leap of faith there), we overwhelmed them and they actually do need people to leave so people who remain can buy GME again (obviously I won't). If this is simply a clearing house issue and they needed funds to be able to settle due to the massive volatility, the only thing that helps them is if people stop buying GME on their app. And since the whole motto is BUY and HOLD, you really shouldn't be using Robinhood.   So again: if you can, please leave Robinhood because I can't.     EDIT  :
I have a confession...
First off, I am a very low level investor. A couple of weeks ago, I bought in to GME at around $36. Bought 10 shares as part of my ~$1500 portfolio. Got excited when it went up over 40, then scared when it dropped back down to a loss. I went all üìÑ  and set a trailing stop order, and ended selling my 10 shares at about $1 profit, happy that at least I didn't lose money.  The next day was the first it closed over $100. And it just kept going up. Eventually, I got back on board... Sold most of the rest of my portfolio and bought $1000 of GME for about   shares.  Im sorry I doubted you. Please forgive me, you beautiful bastards (and bastardettes). I have learned my lesson, and will be buying more GME once my account transfer from Robinhood (üñïRH) to Fidelity is complete.    GME     !
Are Hedge Funds Really this stupid?
I have been thinking about this for a   sure if its just crazy theory or not. I feel like we are just be puppets to some of these hedge funds plans.     Why did Citadel and point72 made it public in their investment into Melvin? Is it likely that they want us to think they are supporting Melvin shorting position while picking up massive long positions in GME, AMC, BB, NOK, etcs to offset that lost?  Also, what will be the end game for all of this? GME will have to fall back down eventually after the squeeze? take a look at VW stock during the squeeze.
Great Scott...$AMC

The front page of Bloomberg has 5 articles about the short squeezes we are inducing, including an article titled "Market Manipulation Is Like Pornography: You Know It When You See It" because we are fucking the shorts.     CNBC's front page has more articles about us, and are trying to spread fear with an article titled "it will take a stream of buyers to keep GME and AMC going."     Wall street journal calls us "barbarians at the gate".     Every bit of financial media is reporting on us. They are scared - nay, terrified. They know they are going to be bitch slapped by the strongest, hardest pair of diamond hands. They know it's not over and that the squeeze has not yet squoze. I smell blood in the water. Buy and hold, fellow retards. Keep the onslaught coming and they will collapse.     GME 69000
The future is brightüçó
The year is 2025. Wsb autists now make up 50% of the elite while the hedgies from yesteryear sweep your yachts and clean your cum-ridden bedsheets. You give them money to watch you fuck their ex-wives, $50 a session.   Robinhood finally IPOs after recovering from the hits they took in the GME lawsuits. The memories of their bonerage come flooding back to you. This is personal, you say to yourself.  You pick up the phone.  ‚ÄúJerry, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but sell 5,000 shares of GME.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh my gourd! That‚Äôs $347,100,000 worth! Did you lose faith in the company?‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo, Jerry, I love the stock. Just do it.‚Äù  Your elite autist buddies do the same. And you put every cent of it into shorting Robinhood at 100% SI. And nobody objects, cause fuck RH  RH is run into the ground within that first quarter. The ex hedgies who wash your cock watch helplessly as their tiny long positions in RH are reduced to dirt. And since all the hedgies migrated to RH post-Feb 2021, since it was the only platform who accepted them, they‚Äôre forced to delete the app too as RH declares bankruptcy.   You sit back and put all of your gains back into GME, making each share worth 6 figures. You contentedly rub one out to DFV‚Äôs weekly livestream.   (this will never be financial advice)
Should you Invest in ________? Ask yourself these questions
1. When you wake up in the morning, is the first thing you do log in to /wallstreetbets to look for the next "hot stock"? If you do, then you do not need a stock account. 2. Do you know what "Personal Risk Tolerance" is? If not, then no, you do not need a stock account. 3. Is your vocabulary less than 2 vowels and 3 consonants but yet consists of 45+ Emoji Icons in the "recently used tab". If so, then no, you do not need a stock account. 4. Did you wake up this morning wondering why your account did not move on a Sunday? if so, You should stay out of the market. 5.  Do the words like, In the Money, Out of the Money, LEAPS, Theta, Delta, Decay and "The Greeks" scare you? If they do, you need to go read a book. 6. Is "Due Diligence" something you can even attempt? Re-read the answer to question 3. 7. Are you here because "Fear Of Missing Out" has turned you into some religious robinhood figure that is going to stand against the big man and take his billions? If so, you should probably delete your Investing app. 8. Is your life a joke, do people around you look at you and make you feel like nothing you have ever done is good enough and that somehow the .0000001% chance your .3 shares sells for 25$ past April 20th will redeem you from everything you have ever stood to hate about the world and you will feel the hand of god through the Fidelity app.... You should probably just uninstall the app, buy your family KFC and watch some   tonight, get some rest, and remember tomorrow you have to work.
No, listen to me: It doesn't matter if short interest is above or below 100% of float. There is still a bigass short squeeze.
Some folks seem confused about the fact that greater than 100% of GME floated shares are short.  (example     I'm here to tell you: IT DOES NOT MATTER whether the short percentage is above or below 100%.  Even 20% of a stock being shorted is a bigass signal that locating enough shares to cover is going to be REALLY HARD.  So let's look at why 100% of shares shorted doesn't matter: Shorted shares work exactly the same as money multiplication in fractional-reserve banking.  Picture a stock with exactly 1 share in its float, and that share is owned by autist "A". Shorter B borrows the share via a broker, sells to a buyer C, and the buyer C leaves it with the broker. The broker loans it out again to another shorter D, who sells to another buyer E.  Now there are two people who have shorted (B, D) and the short interest is 200% of the float. Note also: three people think they own the stock, and the total shares they own is 300% of the total shares issued by the company.      IT SIMPLY DOES NOT MATTER THAT 100% of the shares are shorted because there are now 200% of the shares in the hands of longs.     When you count up the total shares held by longs, even 1 share is loaned out for a short results in more than 100% of the float are owned by longs.  So GME has 113% of the float shorted on Friday, which means 213% is in the hands of longs.  This is still a VERY tough scenario to cover.  tl;dr GME

GUIDE FOR TAKEOFF
1) HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. (OR BUY) ü§≤üèæ ü§≤üèæ ü§≤üèæ ü§≤üèæ  Literally all we have to do for reaching the   Andromeda Galaxy   is to hold. They are scrambling for every share in the market that they can get to cover and hide their extremely illegal naked short-selling and even more illegal counterfeit share issuing.   2) DON'T GET DISTRACTED BY FAKE NEWS  There are a lot of posts over the weekend saying silver will be the next big squeeze. We should regard every such post with caution and scepticism. They are trying desperately to divert our attention. So don't listen to these reports and tweets as they may represent a trap. Reminder that they can manipulate data as well (such as S3 short interest data and Ortex data)  3) BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING  Last week, they used disgraceful tactics but expect next week to be  astronomical  in terms of  attacks  and manipulation. The hedgefunds will try everything to force us into selling. Whether it's the distribution of fake news via their friends in the media (CNBC, Bloomberg, WSJ et al.) or short-ladder attacks. We should prepare for everything including trading halts. Know that we (with support of the whales  ) have leverage if we just simply hold onto our shares.   4) YOU MIGHT WANNA REMOVE YOUR $1,000/$  LIMITS     The short squeeze has not   yet at all  . When it does, it has the potential to be the beast of all squeezes, forget    Andromeda   , this may get us to the    bounds of the known universe   .   $10,000 is not a meme  .   5) WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER         ‚Ä¢Btw if you wanna change brokers but have shares on Robinhood, I advise you to wait until this is over. It takes 2 weeks to transfer shares to another broker like Fidelity and could play into the hands of Citadel.  You can circumvent this and sign up for Fidelity and others simultaneously to your existing RH account. Diversification is the key üîê.  (Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor in anyway. I just like the stock a lot  ü§≤üèæ  , 4 GME @ $212)
ROBINHOOD IS JUST THE FALL GUY
My fellow retards,  We all felt betrayed when Robinhood halted trading in $GME, $AMC, $BB, and $NOK this week. But they are being set up.  Did you notice that lots of other brokerages also had restrictions?  Robinhood got a ton of awful PR from this. Do you think they  wanted  to fuck themselves over?  No my frens, their hands were forced. So then, who made the call?  # The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)        You probably never heard of them. You've never seen CEO Mike Bodson on CNBC. They like it that way.  But it was the DTCC that   raised Robinhood's collateral requirements by 10x    , causing them to raise an emergency $1 billion and halt trading on many stocks.  Vlad would LOVE to tell you this on air, but he can't. He is completely under the thumb of the DTCC. It's a case of "we have altered the deal, pray we don't alter it any further"  Listen, I don't trust Robinhood. They're a bunch of ü§°ü§°ü§°.  But at least they provide a valuable service, when it's working.  What service does the DTCC provide?  Zilch. Nada. They are   pure middlemen  , earning a toll while providing nothing of value and taking no risk.  The DTCC is a clearinghouse. A clearinghouse "settles" the trades made at the brokerage. When you're manically clicking buttons all day on your phone, each time you create a trade. That trade doesn't "settle", and the stock doesn't become "really" yours until two days later when the DTCC moves it to your account.  Now if that sounds like some horse and buggy shit, that's because it is. The T+2 settlement is a relic of a bygone era when some broker had to rustle up paper stock certificates out of a filing cabinet and have his fuckboi carry them across town.  Now at some point before all of us were born, horse and buggies gave way to the internal combustion engine, and stock exchanges went electronic. The clearinghouses are just a glorified database run by legions of fuckbois carrying papers to and fro. They're obsolete. But they have money, and therefore powerful friends in Wall St. and Washington.  So clearinghouses had their role protected by regulation.   T+2 settlement is the LAW  . And the DTCC remains a powerful chokepoint that can change the rules to manipulate the market.  You were ready for a fight between David (retards) and Goliath (hedge funds). But the real Goliath on the other side is far bigger than we thought, it's the entire might of the US regulatory state and its leeches.  If you have suggestions for how to stick it to the man, I'm all ears.  # tl;dr  We are getting fucked over by the big bois, and they would laugh all the way to the bank to see us take down Robinhood without even noticing their existence.     For further reading on the role of the DTCC in this current crisis, check out the following links:                 #    A lot of you retards are replying with a link that shows Robinhood is registered as their own  clearing broker  but they still have to obey the capital deposit requirements of the  clearinghouse  they belong to. It was the clearinghouse, DTCC, that jacked up their capital requirements for $GME purchases by their clients this week     # UPDATE    from /u/mjgcfb on dirty tricks in short attacks posted in 2014:     >Pulling margin from long customers -   >   >The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).
Honestly wasn‚Äôt bad for 2 days work. Still holding shares and buying more as soon as I can with Fidelity #DeleteRobinhood
We are in the EndGME now      Credit to u/IsThatPurple
Dear S3
Do you think we are actually retarded?  Firstly you announce today that the shorts are not actually covered contrary to what mainstream media is shoving down everyone‚Äôs throat.   Then you announce that in the space of 6 hours the shorts have covered down to 30 mil on a Sunday with no data mentioned at all after a massive ‚Äúunexpected delay‚Äù    Stop trying to spead fear it won‚Äôt work. You are using the same tactics as the üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç üçã  You reported yourself that on the 28th there was still 58 million in short interest. If thats correct 30 mil was covered on Friday when the overall volume for the day was 50million lol   Edit 1/ The other thing is due to the fact $gme is such a big deal right now why would you publish premature results that you admit yourself are just ‚Äúsuggesting‚Äù the short interest has halved. Wouldn‚Äôt you actually want to be confident and wait for all the data to be collected which you say won‚Äôt be finalised until tomorrow so the results may be more accurate.  Edit 2/ Thank you for awards but buy $gme instead!  Edit 3/ For paid customers who use the platform the short interest  is still showing 100%. Either the announcement is wrong or the product doesn‚Äôt work.    Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor so literally ignore everything I say, I am retarded.
ER release next week - WSB STYLE
In 2008 Wall Street hid Failure to Delivers behind non-SEC regulated ‚Äúex-clearings.‚Äù The SEC released a report warning against this in the future. It is likely happening again, covering for counterfeit shares behind the scenes
"Without shares failing to deliver at the NSCC, it appears that regulators cannot find fraud in the market. Counterfeiters of securities can bypass the NSCC system and carry out their operation by failing to deliver shares outside the NSCC system, commonly referred to as ex-clearing (an agreement between market participants to clear trades with each other rather than at the NSCC). The SEC does not regulate fails to deliver outside of the NSCC system."     Link to full report with bone chilling conclusion, eerily similar to the current landscape. This is not financial advice. Do your own research. I am not suicidal.
Next Short Interest Release date?
Hey so I was thinking, a lot of people are saying the hedge funds are still in this fight and didn‚Äôt actually sell.  I happen to also believe this to be true, based on every indicator it seems they want us to believe the   false narrative   that they pulled out.  Companies have until February 2nd 6pm EST to submit their reports on Short Interest and then from there it will be released publicly after   4pm EST   on   Feb. 9th.    I think this means they have until     at 4pm   to get this stock as low as possible to exit their positions, because if come the 9th there‚Äôs still a high short interest rate on the public record, then I think they know retail traders will all double down.  I believe they‚Äôre trying to plant the seed in everyone‚Äôs mind that tomorrow (Monday) is the final day of this phenomenon. So they‚Äôll happily contribute to making a squeeze happen (anyones guess how high) but then they‚Äôll afterwards push the narrative that it‚Äôs over to try to plummet the stock.  I know some people probably plan on holding indefinitely, but for those that do intend to take a profit, even just a partial profit to cover their investments, consider the information above. In the scenario where the stock stays high until after the Short Interest report comes out, it could potentially cause the biggest squeeze yet.  I am not a financial advisor. Please correct me if anything I‚Äôve said is incorrect and I‚Äôll add it as an edit if you‚Äôve provided sufficient evidence.  I own two GME stocks, because I like the stock and believe in the fundamentals.  Edit:  toutoucnc pointed out they could just   lie about the data.   I still think this upcoming date is important to know but don‚Äôt rely on the data that will come out as fact. Anything could be misinformation, and I‚Äôm a noob at investing so take everything I‚Äôve stated with a large grain of salt.  Edit 2:  That said I think the essence of my post is still valuable. They could help us achieve a short squeeze that feels like it‚Äôs all over, but then they could sell off to try to trigger a falling house of cards. I may just   hold   for enternity and pass the stocks down to my children as   relics of the historical event   that led to a mass awakening.
How is short interest calculated?
Alright retards put down your fidget spinners and get your dicks out of your hands I got a serious question.  How do people actually figure out how many outstanding shares of a company are shorted?  Is there some regulation that says that RH or eTrade or whoever needs to submit some kind of numbers on all their short orders every EOD?  Or is this whole house of cards built on top of some asshole saying "man those hedge funds hate GME so much they probably shorted more stock than is outstanding" and then some other asshole being like "HeY gUYS diD yOu HEAR? ShorT floAT on GME is >10000% !!!!!1"
ALL YOUR SHARES ARE BELONG TO US
Life AFTER GME - Back to doing some DD!
Good evening OG and newbie autists,    TLDR = HOLD GME for as long as you can this DD is for AFTER the squeeze, once out get your money into PUTS.    I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.  If the situation is as severe as u/johnnydaggers & u/vinlo make it look then this could happen A LOT faster.        GME TO THE MOON         The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç  it is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.  What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:     I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.    Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?    The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.    You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now   The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks   There was then a 26% rebound during the   peak   of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.   The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash  Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY   37%   from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY   28%  ?    HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?       So I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.  This is where we are now:        If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.  My plays:  GME TO THE MOON - Mix of options and shares and riding this into VALHALLA  As for the bullshit above I am going to be going with:  315P (4-6 Weeks out)  200/250p range or both EOY  I am not a financial advisor, I don't know anything about anything.  I like stonks like GME and this is my very biased mostly retarded fully autistic opinion.           Edit 1 - I really appreciate the awards but put that money to better use!  GME     for now!  Edit 2 - I do not believe this most recent update from S3. Few reasons where did they get new numbers 6h later on a Sunday? Two - How the fuck do you cover 30M shares on a 50M volume?

GameStop short Melvin Capital lost 53% in January
To the newcomer
Just a reminder, especially if you're new here, you're not in competition with anyone else on your market account, your financial net worth, or your life.    It's easy to look at the million dollar yolo paydays on here and get jealous, bitter, or simply disheartened at it.  Perhaps even just look at it as if it was an easy day.  But remember most didn't start with a trust fund, they started with a small amount and rolled it into a bigger amount over time.  It's easy to watch someone play a musical instrument and think it looks easy until you try.  Trading is the same way.  It looks easy but it takes time and practice to figure out a system that works for  you .  And many here have blown their accounts up, losing  everything , on bad bets and have had to start over.  I've even seen people get genuinely suicidal over losing it all after risking way more than they should have and ending up on the wrong side of a bet.  The stock market is an unforgiving environment, and if money or money making becomes your life you can easily lose it trying to grasp more and more.  There's way more to life than money, but if you're going to play here you need to know what you're doing and the risks involved.  Anyways, right now we're coming off a year of record gains in certain companies and sectors and it's been easy mode.  With the GME and AMC run ups of recent, it's been easy mode (thus far) even more so.  Don't think this is the norm, because it is very much    NOT   .  After these plays are over (and one day they will be), there will be others.  You'll have to do your own homework (like DFV did for  years  before anyone knew who he was) on potential stock picks and plays.  Please be cautious of anyone who gives you stock picks and I'd actually research them.  I got into GME last year, but I did my own DD before throwing money at it.  It was a decent value play with a very high upside.  But even I didn't think we'd go this far up.  The recent run up feels a lot like the dotcom run up to me.  Different setup and scenario but similar overwhelming positive euphoria and a big draw of people who seemingly have never traded before.  This ended in some serious tears for a lot of people and years of debt or bankruptcy for some.  Getting caught up in a buying euphoria can be dangerous.  Don't let the yolo paydays here fool you, there's been yolo losses too.  WSB isn't your normal trading sub.  This is a place for high stakes bets.  All the memes and humor aside of instant paydays, Rome wasn't built in a day, and your market account probably won't be either.  If you're looking to build wealth and understand the market, this probably isn't the place.  r/finance r/investing and/or r/stocks might be better options if you're new.   Most of the major brokerages have education series on their websites and/or through their apps as well as other online sites that teach basics for free ( .  You have a lot of knowledge at your fingertips if you care to learn and make use of it.   Don't be stupid.   ü§îüìñüí°

Can GameStop buy/merge with steam?
Just a thought, what if GME (now with a 20+bln market cap) merged/bought Steam (valued 2-4 bln)? it aligns with Cohen's  "GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences ‚Äì not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem. "      also, outside of people who like the stock right now, i think it would significantly boost the # of investors (retail and institution alike) to like the stock  and if not steam, epic games (whatever it is, you get the idea)  TLDR -> GME merges/buys steam??                                          20 shares @ 144. 10 shares @ 325  Edit 1: made a mistake looking up steams valuation. It is 10bln as of 2019, not 2-4. I saw an old number.

S3 Partners didn't provide the report they wanted
EDIT 4: An interesting one. Ihor Dusaniwsky from S3 answered on the question how it can be that they speak two different stories within 6 hours with " Seriously, trading changes on a day to day basis, shorts were holding on and now we are seeing them cover their positions. " -   \- but paying users for their software still have 100% SI in the app. There only two options: They are lying or they are having a shit product. Both things are not good for them  Edit 2&3: As a comment said correctly " Buoy isn't a typo you retard. " - Thanks /u/tosseriffic  Edited: Structured it more. I wrote it like a real monkey and $GME holder.        TL;DR: S3 Partners announced some breaking news on $GME for today and didn't deliver. They delayed the report by over an hour and then handing out a 12 year olds school report which has been done during the lunch break.     Earlier this day they were showing indications that media is giving wrong impressions on how shorted the stock is:  "Amid the chaos of   shorts are actually NOT covering. Take a look at this u/S3Partners data to see what we‚Äôre talking about."  Link:        3pm ET they gave their announcement on an " Exclusive    Then again some time later they have published there report which doesn't fit there quality standards and usual work. It gives a strong feeling that they were stopped in publishing their original work and quickly scrambled some stuff together.     The post and report doesn't provide even close to any useful data or proof to anything.  Link to tweet:    Link to breaking news report:       Some shit has happened in the meantime. Something is fishy. They got pulled into some shit and got weak knees.  DON'T TRUST THEM. RIP S3        HOLD THIS STOCK. WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Shkreli on GME - 1/31
Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli & subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.    Let's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.    Short-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.    Short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a "buy-in". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.    My point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.    New longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.    In essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block?     Speculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate.     But even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?    On populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.    Some of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'    Who do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.    The need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.    No one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with <50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.    You might ask, "(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a "cause"), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to.     Of course, if you've found the "next" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/"short squeeze" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from "well, Gamestop was/is cheap" to "the gaming cycle" to "Ryan Cohen will save us" to " !"    Each member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.    Loosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!    I still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at <50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day.     Disclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.  (From martin, posted by mo)
Why retail investors should quit zero-commission platforms right now
# What is Robinhood's business model?  The company generates significant income from  ¬†and trading venues.Ôªø While the payments are negligible for small retail trades, a company that directs billions of dollars in trades to market makers can earn substantial amounts. This means that you are not a customer for Robinhood,   you are the product  . Your trading data, even considering it is full of autistic buys and sells, is valuable to the big players in the financial world.  # The conflict of interests  So considering more than half of Robinhood's revenue comes from these big financial companies, all directly connected to big hedge funds, there's a direct conflict of interest between Robinhood's clients going bankrupt and the users of their platform getting rich. The GME short squeeze made by retards like you definitely made Robinhood suffer pressure from its clients and they decided to pick the big cucks side.  # Will retail traders keep trading on zero commission platforms?   You can't ignore the fact that people are actually retarded, so they will continue to use Robinhood even tho there's always be a chance that all of this happening again. The price of GME only stopped at $400 because most retail investors were trading on Robinhood,   no company should have such a high impact on retail investors   if we are really seeking to bet against cucks from Wallstreet.   #

NEWS: Girl Scouts signs $87 billion dollar deal to use Palantir (PLTR) software for cookie distribution optimization.
This may have gone under the radar with all the hubbub surrounding GME but the significance of this contract cannot be overstated.    The details of the contract are a little muddled at this time but it appears to be a seasonal contract, as in they Palantir software is only available to Girl Scouts of America during the summer months so they don‚Äôt have to be paying during the wintertime when they can‚Äôt fundraise anyway.   Downside: the price of cookies will probably go up astronomically.   Positions: GME
You can make Citadel money (SLV) OR you can make your own medicated Tendies. ($CGC) SLV vs WEED.
Alright retards. The SLVer dudes want you to take down JP Morgan and help make Citadel money with your money.  Fuck that.

S3 announces shares shorted for $GME are below 30 mill
Dear retards, Ihor Dusaniwsky is saying that the shares shorted are below 30M, which would mean that the SI is around 50%. The data is not yet final and their algorithm is still calculating.     What does this mean? I have sent a twitt to Ihor as soon as he posted that info asking whether he likes my  ü§≤. This has worked in the past. He has not liked them yet, but I will edit if it happens.  Positions:  I don't fucking care, I am gonna fuck them so much anyway, but let's pick doggy  But also 435 shares from $37 to $40 more or less     This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor but only a retarded stock warrior.     EDIT: many likes, but not Ihor's. He just posted this:        EDIT2: Ihor is usually up for discussion and replies a lot of twitts.

EDIT3: As our fellow retard /u/Asynchronization points out:  >But to be honest maybe he left us with a clue, it‚Äôs clear that this is not what he was trying to communicate.

Those of you getting into silver just made Citadel and the banks millions, well done...
Why DID Robinhood halt trading on Thursday? A hypothesis from a fellow autist...
Consider the following timeline‚Ä¶.  Once upon a time, hedge funds and brokerages decided GME was a dog and is the easiest money they‚Äôve ever made and place positions (puts) betting that the price will go down. They placed bets to the tune of 140% of nominal value of all shares outstanding.  Some autists on Reddit identify this massive naked short bet and don‚Äôt feel their beloved GME (who they have DEEP SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS for) is quite the dog its being made out to be and so, just for fun, start buying the stock and placing call options, betting that the price will go up. They talk about it on WSB because that's what we do on WSB. Taking contrary positions is what autists do best. They almost WILL their beloved Gamestop to rise. It does. Disbelieving billionaire shorts see this and say WTF? This cant be happening That‚Äôs what celebrities said during the Great Fappening too. It still happened.  The ground swell grows until it hits critical mass and people are making REAL money. Wuuuut, you can transfer money to Robinhood and they will instantly approve you for trading in options? How hard can this be? People who have never bought a stock or placed an option order in their life are making a killing. Word spreads. More join the fray. More huge wins. Loooks fun! More and more and more jump in.  Meanwhile in hedgietown, things are looking really fucking dire. WTF are these autists doing??? This CAN‚ÄôT be happening‚Ä¶ heeelp I‚Äôm melting. They watch their easy money being plundered by a merry band of retards enabled by no less than‚Ä¶ Robinhood. Not only is hedgie sure thing easy money evaporating but they appear to have been somewhere they simply could not have believed possible. On the "wrong side" of a trade that potential carries a net loss so fucking impressively large that it might destroy some of the largest players on Wall Street and create an event that would cause systemic risk in financial markets. Doh. We done fucked up this time. Wuuuuuut?     The ground swell on Reddit turns into a tsunami. It starts to make the news‚Ä¶  A strategy coalesces among the autists. Hey! If we hold and don‚Äôt sell wont the price rise? It appears to work.  Hedgies now have lost their appetite and have stopped wanking or fucking and haven‚Äôt bathed or shaved in three days. They are drinking that 100 year old scotch they were holding for a special occasion like it was water. Increasingly urgent calls go back and forth among hedge fund managers, bankers and brokerage principals.  On Wednesday January 20th a conference call is arranged between the main players and the CEO of a private firm called Robinhood Holdings.  An offer is made.   Hedgies: Hey V    . Great little company you got there. It would be a shame if it no longer existed say... next Monday, because it bankrupted the companies that do its settlement and it imploded US financial markets. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree?   RH: (Silence on the line‚Ä¶)   Hedgies: Here‚Äôs a big favor we need from you to prevent that from happening. We need you to halt buying on GME on your platform for a ‚Äúfew hours‚Äù. Can you do that favor for us? If you do, we can guarantee you will have our long term support and will ensure that you survive. This will have long term benefits for everyone including you and Robinhood, we assure you.  RH:So you are saying this is a systemic risk event?  Hedgies: Yes, that's what we are saying.   RH: But what will we tell our account holders?   Hedgies: It‚Äôs only for a few hours. Just tell them settlement issues or liquidity concerns or something. In exchange for this favor, we are going to give you funding to make sure nothing happens to your company. So it‚Äôs a win-win. Would a 250 million dollar forgivable loan be okay?   RH: (A long moment‚Ä¶.) Yes, okay.  Hedgies: Done. It‚Äôs transferred.    Upon reaching the agreement for the ‚Äúfavor,‚Äù hedgies get to work placing enormous bets on GME for the next day (betting the stock will go down on Thursday). They also place huge call option positions for when the halt on buying is released at a pre-determined time on Friday, betting the price will go up. They know after the halt, a violent price swing will trigger their new short positions and when the halt is lifted the price rise will trigger their call options.    RH halts buying in GME for ‚Äúa few hours‚Äù. The hedgies new shorts placed on Wednesday (for Thursday) are exercised to the tune of billions. When ‚Äúlimited‚Äù buying resumes on Friday, per plan, the price for GME shares rockets higher, triggering the hedgies call strikes.   Hypothetically speaking, how much could one make if one were a hedgie ~~manipulating~~ saving the market like this? Billions and billions. How much did hedgies need to unwind their positions last Friday, 24 hours before this occurred?? Billions and billions. Hypothetically, that's an amazing coincidence....  Given this hypothetical, would it be enough to unwind more than their Friday positions? How much more? None? Some?  Dunno, WSB I‚Äôm just another retard like you. As proof of that I sold GME on Tuesday at 80 and bough BB.  Don‚Äôt be retarded like me. HOLD THE DAMN LINE but expect more tricks this week. Goodluck and godspeed.
We need to spend more effort on crowdsourcing information on the things that we want to buy. Not just stocks on the market but more importantly consumer products. This information will help us make more informed trades. Hear me out.
We are retail investors. But we are also the consumers. We know what we want, what our friends want, and what our family members want to buy on a daily basis. Use that information and tell the subreddit.  We are also the workers. We know what everyone buys. If you work in retail, start paying attention to trends of what people buy and tell us on the subreddit. If you work in manufacturing, are there a lot of orders or fewer than normal? We'd like to know.  Corporations spend billions of dollars each year for  consumer research to inform them on what to produce. We already possess that information. On an internet forum with millions of people we have the ability to have a competitive independent research apparatus that is free. That is such a huge advantage we have.  It must be difficult for some hedge fund investor who is in their office all day to really understand what people want and are willing to buy in "the outside world." They aren't buying cheap consumer products bc they don't have to. They can't buy the knowledge we have.  As investors, we need to think about investing as opposed to trading for short term gains. We can influence a company that produces a specific product that we think people want, build it up, and that company (with its newfound capital that we gave it) will make that product that people will buy.  AND WE WILL MAKE. FUCKING. BANK.  We have 7 million people in this sub. 7 MILLION!!  The newbies can participate just as much as the veterans as a source of free research and information in this regard. The veterans in return can teach the newbies how to invest properly. Everyone wins if we put our 40 IQ brains together.   Mods, please start a weekly thread about market and consumer information so we can have our very own (and free) research department.
Why is wall street bets removing like 99% of posts ?
I understand that 7 million users is a lot of people to moderate, but I don‚Äôt think that auto removing post before they even reach new is the way to go. I appreciate everything the mod team is doing but I would like to at least be given a reason why posts get auto removed.  Is it key words? Is it just random ? We are left in the dark  I think a better solution would be to have a karma or account age requirement to prevent most bots.  Sorry for the rant.
$AMC tomorrow gonna be a movie   üçø
We only needed to get above $9. Boy did we beat that number. Now the game really begins. Holding is crucial as there will be great tendies ahead this coming week. Make sure you get a good nights rest, it‚Äôs hard as fuck to get enough sleep on the weekdays I know it first-hand. AMC will in fact moon tomorrow if we all hold. The suits will have to pay us so much that they can‚Äôt afford the dry cleaning bills.  Don‚Äôt listen to the certified dumbasses on CNBC, they‚Äôre only speaking to their own best interest and not yours. DYOR and make sure to only buy what you‚Äôre capable of losing.

RUH ROH
The Week of 2/1 in a Nutshell
My small slice
We do not need CNBC to be heard! Let‚Äôs get trending on Twitter ASAP Before Monday
If you don‚Äôt know how to read, TLDR below.  Firstly, i think my idea might take some of the pressure off of the mod mail and excessive post problem so please read! (If you know how)  Billboards and plans flying is great and all, but we need to leverage all these social media platforms as much as possible. If you like the stock GME or AMC or BB, then consider flooding Twitter with hashtags.   A bs stock I can not mention (so the this can get posted) was just #2 trending on Twitter and they are taking all the hype. As much as only posting and commenting on this sub is great, we need the people who aren‚Äôt on Reddit to see that we are not the scumbags that CNBC is making us out to be.   Take the donation stories, the DD, and Diamond hand emojis and rocket ships over to Twitter and let‚Äôs get #GMETOTHEMOON #AMCTOTHEMOON etc trending in front of these bs stocks trying to steer people away from the real prize!  Tweet that video of Jim Cramer exposing market manipulation, and let‚Äôs expose the hedge funds. We don‚Äôt need CNBC telling everyone how people here are actually using there gains for good we can tell them ourselves!   The media is being paid by billionaires to make us out to be the bad guys. If 1/5th of the people on this sub each tweeted the same hashtag, we would be number a trending on Twitter and we would be heard!!  What do I know tho, I eat deodorant sticks.  TLDR=   strong together! Tweet #GMETOTHEMOON and let‚Äôs get trending on Twitter!      üñï    Edit- it seems like bots have hijacked $GME on Twitter claiming the mods of WSB are saying some bs Is the next GME. Report all those accounts
Us vs Them
IF Vlad at RH is telling the truth, it would have only taken $  to keep the game going last week. The complicity runs deep in this one.
First of all, I own one share of GME and am holding until the entire system melts down or $100,000/share. I trade on RH, so that's all I could buy on Friday. Now strap in.   Mods: For the love of God, let this through. My account is 4 years old, I have 10K karma, and I've been posting/active on WSB for close to a year now.   I'm going to make this short and sweet. If the brokers are telling the truth, and the lockdown in trading was due to collateral requirements, then according to this article....       ALL WE NEEDED TO KEEP TRADING WAS AN INFUSION OF $ !!!!!!!    But, u/clash_jeremy, that's so much money! NO IT ISN'T. The US Government ran a deficit of   $    last year to keep the whole system going. The Fed added close to   $3T   to their asset sheets to keep the whole system going. So, when it came time to keep the system going for the retail investor,   THEY LOOKED THE OTHER WAY!!!!!    One of the main duties of the Fed and Treasury is to ensure liquidity in all markets. THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE NEEDED WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY of last week.  But, what if they didn't know this was coming. Yeah, convenient alibi if the CEO for DTCC wasn't literally an advisor for the Federal Reserve and the FDIC!      If anyone knew the nonsense that was going to go down, it was this dude, and he has every obligation to alert the powers that be that there needs to be some sort of intervention to keep the game going. Nobody did anything, because if they allowed us to keep playing the game as normal last week, the hedgies would have been entirely obliterated.  The complicity runs deep in the shafting that occurred last week. Never forget!
ATTN MODS: SLV pomp and dumpers and bullshit being spammed in inboxes
Hello Mods,   I've only been here for a few months and this is the first time I've had an account spam my box with a straight up bullshit con.     There's a lot of bullshit about SLV being the next big thing, claiming that it's coming from here when just about every public post is saying it's horseshit.      The message that went to my inbox is at the end of this.      For the rest of you smoothbrains   DO NOT BUY SLV, IT IS BULLSHIT. YOU ARE MOST LIKELY BEING CONNED. THERE WILL BE NO SLV SHORT SQUEEEEEEEZE!       MODS: Pls ban this cunt.      ' from   sent an hour ago       Be careful, there are a lot of ETFs out there that claim that they are backed by Silver and Gold, but in the fine print, indicate that they would not have to deliver if they are called out on it.      ETF plays, are      PSLV      for silver, as they are backed by actual silver. DO NOT buy SLV, as that etf will not deliver on physical silver.    I am buying,   physical silver, gold, and the miners.   Physical Silver is my preferred investment. How high can the price go? Not sure, but we can be certain that owning physical silver and gold, will protect you from the eventual collapse of this ponzi scheme.  This is the real big trade, once GME is done that everyone should start paying attention to.  Not a financial advisor, so please do your own due diligence. Read the fine print on any ETF prospectus you buy.'

\ This is not financial advice. I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only.     This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.        What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.       First, an overview of what happened last week:     \-There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.   \-Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.     \-Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY (no more limits!), and relaxing the share/call restrictions on NOK.   \-Cramer said last Friday that GME holders "already won," that they must take profits, or otherwise risk "immense pain".    \-CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.    \-Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.    \-CNBC also bought "paid promotions" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions.   Guys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive. I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in "the stocks we like". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards.   Except, the bigs f\ d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here's why:      1) Don't Think of Elephants    Quoting JGL's character in  Inception , what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants.   Robinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the "do-not-buy a lot" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.  Actually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea. Not really. It's too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\ Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It's too late to add fees now, because it will be "on top of" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the "less bad" decision and picked the worse one.     2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)    So, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that "retail investors will be in for some real pain". Do we believe what they're saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions. Thursday's GME low was $112. If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday.     3) Opportunities    a.   Black Friday of the Century     Hold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There's gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane.   b.   Retail Arbitrage of the Century     If you didn't already, open up new accounts on E\ trade or Ameritrade, Buy those "do not buy a lot of" stocks you can't get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.  TL;DR - There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure. Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from "done".
A really stupid question on GME and initiating a squeeze.
Because option sellers try to be delta neutral, what would be wrong with doing a buy/write covered call at the strike price of $1?  Yes, you will lose most of your $1 ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù as the bid wouldn‚Äôt cover your initial cost of $100, but it would set off a nuclear bomb under this and I think a positive feedback loop might take off.  I estimate that if you did this, you would lose $75 or so of your initial $100, but the entertainment might be priceless.  Of course this isn‚Äôt advice, I‚Äôm spectating on inexpensive entertainment.

Side note GME to the MOON      v2 EDIT:      credit to u/smahd55  \  -  This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (‚Äú  Blackberry  ‚Äù) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.  We will be discussing Blackberry‚Äôs product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.  The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.  QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.  \     --  Shoutouts:     This is a continuation of what I've posted in other threads, notably here:      Disclaimer -   Not investment advice etc. Not an advisor.

Robinhood is toast....Fidelity massive transfer volume
For what it's worth...  This morning I called up Fidelity because I wanted to make sure my extended hours trading was enabled on my   90 minutes on hold to get through.  Apparently, they are slammed over at Fidelity, I asked the gal on the phone what's it been like   said because of all this stuff with Robinhood, they're looking at +700% daily volume for transferring accounts, which is quite amazing.  Happy hunting!   WE LIKE THE STOCK!  STICK IT TO THE MAN!

How to cement the WSB legend
To my degenerates,   We are currently a part of one of the most historical times in the history of the stock market. Now, it is incredibly evident how they will try to make us seem. We are a bunch of fucking degenerates. I mean, a lot of you get off on losing tens of thousands of dollars only to YOLO another weekly on a Thursday night. I get why the media would resent us, the corporations/hedge funds suckle from their teet so they take easy shots. Even though these hedge funds ARE CLEARLY in the wrong.   We have shown there is strength in numbers and with   of us, what if we take a small portion of our profits and we create a thread to show, how we took our tendies from this (  WHEN IT IS OVER OFC  ) to make the world a little bit better. You could use this post to make it or another, it does not matter.     Think about how the narrative could be. A group of Redditors beat the hedge funds and then immediately proceed to give their money back to charities/communities/etc doing more for the world than most hedge funds have ever done. Now picture this, with   of us, if we all donate $125 (an amount I think is doable if you are not paper-handed) that would conveniently be more than a billion dollars given to charities.   Yeah, a billion. While the media and hedge funds are bitching about how these hedge funds lost billions of dollars, here we are: "a bunch of so-called degenerates putting billions of dollars into charities." Now it is one thing to tell your kids one day, "yeah I made a killing during the short squeeze of the millennia," but I was a part of something which gave a BILLION dollars to charity. The media would not be able to handle it. We have them on the ropes. Let's bite their fucking ear off while we are at it!   I will see you all on the other side.   Let's show the world we can not only change the world for ourselves with the stock market but for others!   Thank you for everything you have done for my family. Let's change the world for the better.  \-Sc00b

$GME: The biggest stalemate of the 21 Century...
(This is an opinion based post. Treat it as an entertainment post and not as a factual post. It's all alleged. I'm not a financial advisor and don't take anything in the post as financial advice.)  (Repost due to mistakes)  By  now as most of us know, Melvin cap has lost 53% on its investments and  that's only what we know(What's hidden to the public is way worse). You  might wonder, why the fuck didn't they exit their position yet? before I  answer the question, I want you to put into perspective the following.  Let's say that $GME was shorted around an average price of 40$(which is a  best case scenario for them) with 140%(if we combine all the players)  and on Friday $GME closed with the price of 325$! Which is an increment  of +700%(of the ideal short position of 40$). It means that as of Friday  they have lost their initial short position 7 times over! Them and  every other big player. So what? They most probably went to a margin  call and that's why they got the bailout money from Citadel. But why  won't they cover you might ask? Why prolong the pain and hold longer??  Well,  Imagine that you had the   Infinity Gauntlet of Wall street   with Billions  of Dollars, political power, and all the media in your palms, but with  all of that you got fucked over 7 times by a collective group of apes  who banded together with accounts averaging around 2000$! Keeping that  in mind, do you think that they will ever fold? Due to them knowing that  we are retards, they think that the $GME play is a house of cards and  with the right play the house will eventually collapse to presqueeze  levels. They will never accept a -700%+ loss and will try every play in  their Ivy league book on us. They used every possible trick in the book  from using the corrupt media, to ddosing Reddit and stocktwits, until  they finally were so desperate and used their Ace of Spades(Robin  Hood)(which took years in the making) in order to exit this shit hole.  Initially, it worked but when it started to fail, they went to full  market manipulation mode(stock restrictions). Freezing Buying didn't  fully work on $GME so they went and fucked every other stock they could.  They won on the side tables by fucking $AMD, $NOK, $BB, $AAL, etc...  and that reloaded their ammunition which is scary for me.  Now  moving forward, I don't think they will ever cover because they will  never accept a loss from an uneducated blue collar class in their eyes.  IMO, they think that they will be able to bend us over after all, but  they still don't understand that we don't have anything to lose. More  over, a lot of the people started with nothing and are willing to go  back to nothing if it means that they got a chance to fight and  potentially defeat the big guy on the battlefield. My biggest fear in  all of this is that even if we win, they will make a liquidity crisis as  their penultimate play. Then the government will have to interfere and  again bailout the big guy, because of course, when the small guy wins  for once, there is a liquidity crisis and his win isn't a win anymore  because small guys never win... But the real win, imo, is the small guy  while being poor, underprivileged, uneducated, and using primitive  weapons(metaphorically), being able to defeat a superpower(hedge funds)  in the battlefield(stock market).
GME - Blackrock / ETFs
Fellow Degenerates,  I keep it   I meant long. I tried to add some spice so your brain can digest. Just keep going line by line! You can do it!  I am first of all scared to death that this is going to be removed in a second by autobots - yeah these scary guys from Transformers which you don't wanna fuck with (rather your friends wife to become officially her boyfriend - would be interesting to be for once on the other side of the trade).  Oh and if ever this post remains - this is no financial advice - I have literally no clue what i am talking about and I lost more money than I am ever able to retain - even if GME goes to the and I keep my     Still I want to give it a try as I think there is two things one could include into the discussion which might add perspective.  First of all I was thinking about the role of Blackrock in this for quite a bit. I think a number of posts mentioned that they are a large shareholder of GME and that they increased their position. For what reason though? I came accross this paper   or not.  Second I was thinking about possibilities how one could aquire Gamestop shares in different ways. Just out of pure boredem (ofc) and realized that r/investing mindset for once could be the solution (who would have thought this is ever going to happen!). So I went here:   and was quite surprised to see that some of these ETFs have a significant share of GME in them. I have no clue how they come up with their particular distribution as I have no clue about how ETFs in general work but maybe it allows to acquire indirectly one or two shares. Not sure who would be stupid enough to do so - I am certainly not because I am never ever going to lay in bed with the guys from r/investing but at least I filled this extra boring long time between Friday close and Monday bell.  I am not expecting this to be really something prominently discussed (as I am sure this has been raised a million times before and I was just to lazy to use Search) and hence rather to be removed in a second but it was me a pleasure to give it a try and maybe I am lucky for once.  To the moon                          Edit: added signifcantly more rocket emojis to get this to the moon.
People know your rights as shareholders
I‚Äôve been reading up on a blog posted 16 years ago by Marc Cuban he highlights some pretty shitty things that short sellers can do with your shares so please be well informed and know your rights as a shareholder such as the fact that you can call back your shares or that you can get paid if your shares are being loaned out. I‚Äôm still learning myself so if you know more about general shareholders rights or $GME shareholders rights please let me know     I like $GME
The son of a shepherd is not tricked by Ed Boy scams.
You are being played: Citadel and Point72--major hedge funds and investors in Melvin--own tons of AMC, NOK, and BB. The only squeeze that hurts them is GME
The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase.     I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreet bets  after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more.     After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely:        This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well.      Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK.   # BB   , Citadel owns a whopping 1,068,700 shares of BB, and Point72 owns 519,200 shares. No options are owned by either fund. Point72 and Citadel clearly profit from BB's rise.  # AMC    Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase.   # NOK    Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise.     We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with.     The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME     .    These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72).      # Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then?  The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively,  some  hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities.       TLDR:   hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK.   BUY AND HOLD GME IF YOU WANT TO REALLY HURT THESE ASSHOLES. GME TO THE MOON            Disclaimer: I am retarded and not a financial advisor, so this isn't financial advice. I am long GME and not long any of the other positions mentioned in this post (for the reasons I have outlined in this post). I also regularly scrub my post history but have been on this subreddit long enough to be a member of tanker gang.
The Legend Of The Stock
It has been 2 years since I posted the Legend Of IR0NYMAN movie and you guys still hit me up on a regular basis just to say fuck you or holy shit I forgot that even happened. That shit is fucking incredible. You guys are fucking incredible.  Until this week I have never felt the need to post a follow up, mostly because that was peak autism and there is no point in trying to follow that especially with all of the top notch fucking content you guys roll on here every fucking day of every fucking week.  But a lot has changed. The world has changed, the market has changed, the memes have changed. But you degenerate ride or die bi-polar mother fuckers have stayed you. Don't ever change.  I have no idea how the mods have been keeping this place under control these last few weeks, huge props, but I think a large part of it is because you guys are coming here with something to fucking say.  I made a new movie this weekend that the mods will hopefully let me post here when they get to it, but in the mean time it's up on my profile if anyone wants some more old fashioned shitposting while we wait to buy more shares tomorrow.  Stay you you fuckers.

Doing so would make GME stock price explode like a supernova ‚ú®, moving GameStop into the modern age. This move would instantly make GameStop a big player in the gaming industry overnight!!! Many hedge funds would implode, making millions of people adore you.

Gathering All Short Float Estimates
I'll make this short and clear. To determine if the squeeze is happening we keep track of the short float estimates posted by different sources. Because remembering all possible estimates gets a bit annoying I wanted to compile together a list of the various sources of short float estimates. So far I have S3, GuruFocus, Ortex and Marketwatch.  Here is a picture of the file I am putting together, if you have any addition or corrections I will be happy to update it and find a way to share it with you all.  TL;DR: Do you know any other sources for short float estimates?  Edit: This got larger than I expected, just FYI, I am no expert on the matter so I welcome any comments that may explain if I am doing something wrong and how to improve on it. At the end of the day this is not for statistical analysis, just to simplify ease of access to the numbers.

A manifesto for WSB. How to beat Wall Street at their own game and live to tell the tale.
hello all. it's the intermediator here. i have no horse in this race between WSB and /biz/ but i think in the interest of making maximum profits and redistributing wealth, you need to work together.  i know that we are living through a moment of shared euphoria and it is easy to get caught up in it. by all rights i should be asleep by now. but i want to point out how fast this is happening, and how incredibly complex the relations associated with it are. the white house is watching wsb, it's getting front page news coverage worldwide. u/deepfuckingvalue is worth fifty million fucking dollars and is still holding. i have acquaintances and friends i have never spoken to about investing or stocks before messaging me to ask me about gme or amc or bb.  the point i am trying to make is that although we have seen stocks [rocket emoji] before, and although wsb has sometimes gotten fleeting references in say the financial times or the wall street journal, the last seventy-two hours has completely ushered in a new era for wsb. we as a collective entity have broached the mainstream consciousness.  we all know this. my post pertains to how we can use it to our advantage.  my fear is that the casuals are going to lose their nerve and start selling. it is imperative that wsb sends out a message to buy and hold gme, amc and bb (and nok if you're into it, it's 2021, nobody minds what you're attracted to anymore buddy). panic selling because of increased pressure on wsb is not an option. allowing mainstream media to act as propaganda mouthpieces for hedge funds and investment managers cannot be stopped, but it can be proactively countered.  we are seeing historical levels of market participation by people who have never before been a part of the market. if we can convince them to keep constant and hold, prices could skyrocket higher and faster than we have ever seen in recorded history.  don't fuck this up. i don't know if we'll ever have another shot this good ever again.
For those about to rock, we salute you.

DD: Macro Economic Outlook For This Week And Beyond
Hello fellow Autists! I've been doing a lot of research and thinking today about where we're at right now and where do we go from here and I wanted to get it all written out for my own sake but I also might as well share with you guys.        Let me start off by saying that I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I an expert but I do follow the markets closely and I do listen to the experts.        I believe that due to a number of factors that I will outline in this post that we could see a liquidity crisis in the next 1-4 weeks. Now before you start calling me a gay bear please hear me out.        As you retards have been yolo'ing FD's this has gamma squoze the shit out of the market. This is great until the market rolls over and the same dynamic goes against you. When prices go down, the MM's sell the shares they were using as a delta hedge and that makes prices go down faster.        What happened this week with RH and others halting trading on the meme names was a liquidity issue. RH drew down their $500M credit line and borrowed another $1B last week to try and keep up with you guys! Massive call buying causes the VIX to go up. VIX going up means the hedge funds, clearing houses and brokerage firms aren't allowed to operate on as much leverage. Low VIX = Leverage good, High Vix = Leverage Bad. If the VIX stays up all of these entities are going to have to sell off their positions to meet their collateral requirements. GME has more shares short than actually exist so if enough autist hold then they will never be able to fully cover. What happens then?        High VIX means everybody needs to deleverage their positions which means stonks go down :(  There is a pending liquidity problem here. If you look at the chart of GDX for example you will see it always seems to diverge downward from SPY whenever there is a pending liquidity event. In general you would expect to see the TLT go up when the VIX goes up. More volatility means you want to flee to the safety of bonds right? Instead what we're seeing is TLT down while VIX is up. It's my view that TLT will come up and join the VIX very shortly.        Now I'd like to point out that I'm not a gay bear, I'm a bull at heart. The thing is that if we can be prepared for the crash that's coming we can BTFD so hard. If we have nothing at the bottom then there is no money to BTFD!        On Friday we saw stocks sell off to their weekly lows,  the VIX was quite high and bond yields were at their all time low. Low bond yields means people are not hedging their portfolios and / or they're selling bonds to cover their margin requirements. The hedge funds are now concerned that if the market continues to go down they will need to start to deleverage. There is more margin and call options out there right now than there has ever been. This is where that reverse gamma squeeze screws you over. This could cause a fast, sharp move lower. Think March 2020.        In the treasury market last week the short term treasury yields fell to all time lows. Short interest for everyday stocks are at alltime lows. Put option volumes are at all time lows. As prices start going down, market participants realize they need to hedge their bets and so they buy puts. MM's short the stock in order to hedge their put sale and this is where the gamma squeeze to the downside exacerbates the move downward.        Even mutual funds are record long equity and record underweight bonds. As the market rolls over they will also need to sell equities to get into fixed income.        If you look at the SPY yearly chart there is bearish divergence over the past 2 months. What does that mean? RSI has been trending downwards will price has been continuing upwards. This is an indicator of a market trend reversal. The DMARK is also hitting daily, weekly, monthly and yearly high. This is very bearish as well. These signals don't necessarily mean that something that will for sure happen but it is pointing out that there is tons of risk in the system.     Now look at the Covid situation throughout the world. It is calming down somewhat but the problem is we're seeing new fast spreading strains of the virus that could easily turn the situation for the worse very quickly. This could lead to more shut downs which effects the economy and the market. So this begs the question, are all of these companies optimistic reflation projections realistic? What happens if / when they miss earning estimates?        So what do we do about this? First and foremost HOLD YOUR GME, AMC + BB shares. They might be the only stonks that goes up this week / month. Assuming you're not all in on GME, what do you do with your other money? Spy puts, TLT calls and Gold are where you want to be if you buy my idea that this could be March 2020 all over again.  I know these are all gay bear moves. Feel free to disagree with me in the comments!        Be careful out there guys!          TLDR:   The market looks quite risky right now for a number of reasons. Could potentially be like last March. Hold your GME shares, hedge the crash with everything else.        Positions: GME Shares + SLV Calls + Cash, buying TLT Calls and Spy puts tomorrow.     I'm not a financial advisor, please do your own DD!     Edit: Please also read this DD I did this morning but I couldn't post so here is the link to the comment. I spent six hours on it and it's quite eye opening!
CRSR earnings 2/9 load up on calls ya‚Äôll
How a Stock short reaches 140%, without naked shorting, using video rentals as an analogy.
I have seen many people claim, in order for short percent to be above 100%, there must be naked shorting going on. First I would say there is some naked shorting going on, because there are some technical rules that allow naked shorting, but most of the time it is illegal. Now let me explain how a short can reach above 100%, via legal means.  Adam knows the price of videos tends to go down overtime, and his strategy has been too short videos. He would go to Blockbuster and rent The Big Short, and then sell it too Family Video. Bobby also has the same idea as Adam, so he goes to Family Video, rents The Big Short, and then sells it to Blockbuster. This causes the books to see more rental videos are in circulation, even when it is the same video moving among all these different hands.

The FUNDAMENTAL Argument
I‚Äôll make this short and sweet since my ape brain can only write so many words:  Don‚Äôt fundamentals imply that highly shorted companies are vulnerable to a short squeeze? Don‚Äôt fundamentals imply that as the price of a shorted company goes up, shorties are more likely to have to cover?? Don‚Äôt fundamentals imply that when shorties cover, a company‚Äôs stock price exponentially goes higher??? ARE WE NOT USING FUNDAMENTALS HERE?!?!?!  CNBC and hedges, you can take your garbage ‚Äúlack of fundamentals‚Äù narrative and shove it.  $GME          Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not a financial expert and this is not financial advice. I can hardly stay inside the lines in my coloring book.
How long will the HEs stay solvent? GME borrow rates (courtesy of S3 Blacklight) shows, Jan 27 is the day when the carry cost to hold GME shorts peaked and borrow rates were 200% and even higher in some cases
GME Game Theory - is true value of $GME now trapped at whatever the price of the stock is/was when short interest dips to 100%?
Hypothesis: There cannot be a s  back down to $40. The squeeze has also not yet squoze. GME is trapped at whatever price it is/was when short interest is/was 100%. We've already locked in a profit, and now the trade is a waiting game.   Rationale:  Everyone's already figured out what happens when short interest is 100%, and there is only one shareholder. The answer is the shareholder names his own price for the stock, ideally about 90% of the net worth of the short seller.  Unfortunately we are not one. There are paper hands among us. There are 67 million shares and an open market. 95% of the shares are owned by smart institutional $GME longs who also spotted the trade and diamond handed all the way with us.  Let me explain why this might not matter at all. I could be completely way off here, but it would appear that the >130% short interest for so long completely broke the valuation of GME, permanently. The reason has to do with game theory.  When short interest is 100%, shorts all need to cover their shorts in order to close their position and make a profit.   Covering a short is buying a share. Buying pressure drives the stock up. If the stock is up and the short interest is down, you get new incentive to short. New shorts come in, and the stock goes back down.   Say some paper hand longs start to sell. Selling pressure drops the price. The price is now down, but the short interest is still 100%, that introduces buying pressure. Buyers come in, and the stock goes back up. If short covering happens instead, the stock still goes up, but now short interest is down. Stock at same price with short interest down incentivizes new shorts. Stock goes back down, but now short interest is up again, which incentivizes longs to come in and buy shares.  You see where I'm going with this? I know that sounded complicated, but it's okay. We're all retarded here.   HOW DID THIS HAPPEN:  This happened because short interest remained over 100% for almost the entire run up to $400, miraculously. At 8:50am on Thursday, clearing houses blocked the ability to buy GME when it hit $468.   I believe it was at this selloff that the shorts were allowed to cover to below   stock's legitimate value is now completely unrelated to fundamentals, and legitimately actually valued somewhere in the neighborhood of $300-$400 a share because of this game... and the squeeze still hasnt squoze.   I'm either incredibly dumb, or there won't be any bag holders buying $GME at $300.   Positions or ban you say?  $GME 3/15 $105 p sell   $4,108 credit per contract.

How we win the GME wars
As long as we keep profit taking to a minimum and buy the dips when new shorts come in at the top we can keep pushing mini-squeezes until they break or we accumulate enough shares. All we need is 50-60m shares to hold, if we get that it's infinite losses to anyone left holding the short bag. Personally I for one would like to see the mythical infinity squeeze actually play out in real life.  This is not investment advice, this is the beginning of a manuscript for a screenplay I'm writing about gay bears.

Trading Tips for stocks and options. Part I
I  though of sharing some trading tips and answers to questions I‚Äôve seen  multiple times on Discord over the last two weeks. If you are absolutely  new to stocks and options, you should start with likes of Investopedia  to learn basic mechanics and greeks. This post will focus on a little  less obvious things.    1) I sold options and they became In the money. When will I get assigned?    Technically,  you can get assigned at any moment since you‚Äôve sold it. But if there  is any extrinsic value of an option contract (if your option is trading  higher than the difference between the strike price and the current  market price of a stock) it will almost never be exercised before  expiry. Watch out for these two events, though: hostile takeovers and  dividend trigger (if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value).  Well, also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake.    2) It‚Äôs expiry day. At what time will I get assigned?    Most  often Option Clearing Corporation will trigger automatic assignment of  any ITM options, unless other is configured by the client in his  brokerage. The default automatic exercises and assignments processing  time is 16:00 pm Eastern Time. However, the OCC permits client manual  exercise decisions for until 17:30 EST.    3) At 16:00 my sold options have expired worthless. Am I good?    No,  as mentioned above ‚Äì if the price in after hours moves and makes your  options ITM, they can still be assigned until 17:30. Especially be  cautious in the days of earnings or days when 13F are published ‚Äî  those  can move asset prices after hours quite a bit.    4) Can I buy or sell options before/after hours?    No,  generally you can‚Äôt. The exceptions are very select instruments. Also,  some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options  outside regular hours, but you will be, basically, trading with the  broker himself.    5) How options and stocks are taxed if I exercise or get assigned?    Options  premiums are added or subtracted to/from the base price of the stock.  Say, you bought calls strike price 100, for 10$ premium. On the day of  expiry the price of your stock has gone up to 200, Your calls are now  worth 100$, but you still believe that the stock price can go even  higher, you would prefer to own and hold that stock. You can sell those  call contracts and be taxed for profits of 90$ per contract. But if you  exercise your contracts, your base price will be 110$ per contract and  your profit will be your future sale price minus 110$. Works in a  similar way with puts, and short positions in options.   Disclaimer : this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts. This is not an accounting advise, please contact professionals!    6) Why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction (up for calls, down for puts)?    Options  prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a  stock. Again, it is useful to learn the greeks. But to start, you should  understand two most useful aspects: time decay and Implied Volatility.  If you have short term expiring Out of the money options, their price  will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction, but  not fast enough.  Implied  Volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price  changes. The higher is the belief that the price will change ‚Äì the more  expensive are the options (especially with low delta). For example, If  you bought calls after 3 days of insane volatility, but then the next  weeks it moved up for only 1 or 2%, your calls will likely not gain, but  rather lose value, because you bough them at the peak of IV, and since  the volatility seemingly settled down, the market no longer expects huge  moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options.  There  can be also so-called unusual activity. That‚Äôs basically large amounts  of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general  flow. Those events can change premiums for a period of time too and  often indicate a start of a new trend.    7) Can I do a Poor Man Covered Call on a cash account?    Poor  Man Covered Call is a strategy of selling OTM calls but having a deep  ITM call as a hedge. It imitates covered calls strategy. Some people  assume, that since this strategy caps your downside risk, this will be  allowed on a cash account. This is false. Cash accounts allow no naked  options selling, even if your max loss is caped.    8) What is Settled cash and Free Riding Rule?    Most  trades have settling periods. For stocks it is T+2 (the day you traded +  2 business days) and for most options it‚Äôs the next day. This means,  that if you sold something, the cash is not immediately delivered to  your account. Brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash.  This is called Free Riding. But if you sell anything you bought with  unsettled cash ‚Äî they will give you a 90 days restriction for violation  of Free Riding Rule. This is very uncomfortable.  This applies only to cash accounts.    9) If I added to a position under Free Riding Rule, can I still sell if I‚Äôm within limits of what I bought before?    No.  For example, if you had 100 shares for a long time, but bought 10 more  shares under Free Riding, even if you then sell only 1 share before cash  is settled, you will still get a 90 day restriction. At least on most  brokers that I know.    10) Can I sell covered calls when I have 0$ settled cash on cash account?    Not  on all brokers. Some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you  are using formal 0% margin. And since you have 0$ settled cash, your  cash doesn‚Äôt exceed your 0% margin. Sounds moronic, but that‚Äôs how it  works. You might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered  calls on a cash account: you buyback those contracts, get bellow your  settled cash and then can‚Äôt sell new covered calls until next business  day.    11) How to save on commissions if I‚Äôm not using a commission-free broker?    Some  brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options. First  of all, don‚Äôt use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky  ‚Äòspecial sauces‚Äô - 9 times out of 10 you will get both worse execution  and bigger commissions. Secondly, if configurable, always ask for an  All-or-None orders.  This will ensure that your order will be much more  likely filled from one source and on one exchange, thus minimizing your  commission. Finally, there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for  added liquidity. For example NYSE Arca (PSE) and BATS offer rebates to  customers for added liquidity in options trading. Yes, you will get a  cashback for your trades. Configure destination of your orders to select  those exchanges. Note: some brokers will provide those rebates to their  users and some will just take it themselves. Note 2: rebates are  offered for adding liquidity; for removing liquidity you will still get  charged.  Hope this helps! Feel free to write your questions if you have some. And good luck with your trades!

Prediction on Hedge Funds‚Äô Next Attack
Take this with a grain of salt. This is pure speculation and not financial advice. Honestly, this is wild speculation.  TL/DR of TL/DR: Funds are going to fear monger the markets to gain back their profits through shorting the entire market.  Whatever happens, hold $GME!  üèª    TL/DR: Funds are going to short the market, sell their long positions to cover their short positions, create a bearish narrative and fear monger the public by spreading negative sentiment through coordinated media  . Then they‚Äôll profit billions from their shorts and buy back long positions at a discount later. Also, they‚Äôll hope $GME and their other short positions will go down in the process to recoup even more of their losses.  The Beef: Suits are fucked on $GME. They came at us with everything and failed. And now, every move of theirs on $GME is currently being scrutinized by the public and SEC. So they need to explore other options.  They have no other choice but to liquidate their long positions to cover their short positions.... and they‚Äôre going to use this to their advantage. THEIR NEXT BIG PLAY: They‚Äôre going short the market to make back their billions. I believe the suits are going to purposely tank the market through a massive, coordinated sell-off. They‚Äôre going to sell all of their long positions to cover their shorts at a future date, and then they‚Äôre going to promote fear on wall street and to the rest of the world. You‚Äôre going to see increased media   about ‚Äúmarket volatility, uncertainty, sell off‚Äù on all the major news stations and newswires, promoted by the funds. They‚Äôre going to push an entire bearish narrative and create worldwide negative sentiment. They‚Äôre also going to have massive shorts on the market while they do this to put them in a position to make back billions. Once the market is down, they‚Äôll then buy back securities, change their narrative to bullish, and drive the markets up, riding their positions to the top. They control the ‚Äúmarket media‚Äù as we‚Äôve already seen. We‚Äôve also seen how they‚Äôve been able to control the narrative on $GME. And with all of this going on, they‚Äôre going to also hope $GME goes down with the market, as well as their other positions, so they can profit even more.  This sell-off will be a perpetuating cycle, a self fulfilling prophecy. When the big funds sell, other fund wills have no other choice but to sell too in order to save their profits. The narrative will spread and spread. I know this sounds convoluted and complex, but we‚Äôve seen what these funds are capable of. And I can‚Äôt think of any other scenario where these hedge funds come out positive for the year. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. And if I‚Äôm right, I hope the public realizes what they‚Äôre doing.  So whatever happens, HOLD $GME!!!!!   üèª  TL/DR for üêí:  üè¶üìâ ü•±  üèª$GME   My positions (not financial advice):  2/12 $340 SPY puts 2/19 $300 SPY puts (YOLO) 100 shares $GME    Edit: Futures are down. Stay vigilant. Remember, HOLD $GME      Edit2: Futures are green now. Good for $GME?

Trap the GME Shorts
Hedge funds will break out all their tricks tomorrow.  These can be illegal like high frequency trading among themselves back and forth to drop the price.  Let them.  Let them drive it down.  Do not sell. Do not buy.  When they did this a few days ago the stock bottomed at $126.  When it bottoms then unleash the kraken.  They‚Äôll have used up all their ammo and ended up selling or shorting shares to you at the bottom.  My target is $2,500.
Don't glorify these companies like Gamestop and AMC
Don't think for a minute these companies care about you or that they are grand old companies. While yes, it is good to make money on their stock, any idea that these are "great" companies should be thrown out. The executives at these companies are making money hand over fist. And they will issue new stock, which will drop the stock price. Some are even are selling their own personal stock beforehand like the guys at GME (outside of their prescheduled selling).   And don't forget that these companies were pieces of shit in the first place. They  . These people prioritize profit. So stop trying to put them in a good light.

How to fix the short market
I've been thinking a bit about how to fix the current short market problems. Here are my ideas beyond just "more transparency:"      1. When a share is shorted, the original holder is explicitly given a synthetic share (GME-SX, or something). This solves one aspect of transparency.     2. The owners of synthetic shares are entitled to at least half of the charged interest. I do think the brokerages should retain their lending fees, since it takes overhead to support a short market.     3. A synthetic share cannot be traded. This is the inherent risk in owning a synthetic stock vs actual, you can't move it. You CAN recall your stock at any time, but like in the case of GME, it might take a while before you have a real share to sell.     4. A synthetic share is not itself shortable. This should solve the overshort issue.          Why bother doing this? Basically, I think that when an impossible position exists, like with GME,    someone    is going to get shafted, and I'd bet it's the ones with the least amount of leverage. I think these simple changes will still allow shorting, give retail investors another passive income generator, and still leave the possibility for short squeezes, just not infinite ones.
A Consensus on Reasons for Aquiring GME Stock
Many of us will be asked in the coming months why we acquired GME, AMC, Nokia, etc.  I think some soul-searching will help us to better answer such questions. We will be asked by friends sussing us because of negative press, family, etc. Some of us will even be asked these questions in court.  I asked my buddy why he went long on GME and AMC, and his answer literally blew my mind:  "I liked the stock."   To me, that is a fantastic and valid reason to buy stock. I'd be really suspicious if he didn't like the stock.   My answer, personally: "I used a private, proprietary analysis algorithm. GME matched the criteria. I like the financials and believe there is considerable value for GME shareholders going forward."  I want to hear all your reasons fellas, why did YOU buy shares in GME/AMC/etc?

BLNK charging DD + short interest DD
There are many new people here, I do not want this to be a distraction. If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.    So let me preface this by saying   BLNK   will not be the next   GME  . There will probably not be another   GME  . For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a   BLNK   DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.    A lot of companies with high short interest such as   IRBT   and   BLNK  , along with those more talked about companies such as   AMC   just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around.   BLNK   share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like   BLNK   stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up  2400%  from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.   If   BLNK   were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach   GME  's current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an   AMC   and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed   GME   squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that   BLNK   10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.  Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which   BLNK   is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.  Okay so   BLNK   is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype,   BLNK   has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name   BLNK  . Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.    BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:        Selling charging equipment:   They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are   VERTICALLY INTEGRATED   it really changes the narrative a bit.   AAPL   just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.     Utilization  : from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.     Network of charging stations:      BLNK   has it's own cloud based network which will collected  recurring  fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the   AGE OF DATA  ? We know that   DATA   is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note:   PLTR   LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)    BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams        BLNK   recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.     BLNK   inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.   International expansion.   BLNK   has a deal in Greece with   Nissan   to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric   Nissan  . These people will get access to all of   BLNK  's network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.     BLNK   announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an  exclusive  deal with Blessing Health System.   When   BLNK   signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.     BLNK   received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 -   kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.    On 28th of July,   BLNK   and   ENS   entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be ‚Äúeconomically priced‚Äù. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.   On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless).   TSLA   uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the "well I can just charge over night" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.     VERTICAL INTEGRATION  . Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far   BLNK   can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.    Some Other Points to Consider      Supposedly   BLNK   has the only 80  level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because   BLNK   chargers have   load-sharing capabilities  . The   BLNK   IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100  feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred  feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging.   BLNK   envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric.      BLNK  's pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of   Chargepoint  . For those of you who do not know   Chargepoint   is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by   SBE   and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With   Chargepoint   they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On   BLNK  's network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that   BLNK   does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.     BLNK   has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.     BLNK   does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.   Fleets are coming,   BLNK   seems ready for this.     BLNK   can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.   Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.   So you may or may not know that in the USA   TSLA   still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.   Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.    The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around        BLNK   seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.     BLNK  's owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before   TSLA   lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has   million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.   This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think   BLNK   being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.   EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.       BACK TO SHORT SHORTS       So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was   million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no   GME  , I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be  the further   BLNK   moves away from it's "valuation." Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are.   So   BLNK  's short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was   million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were   million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think   BLNK  's chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.  Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on   BLNK   causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on   CLSK   some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece.   BLNK   managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again?   Did I mention who else hates   BLNK   charging?   SHITRON   himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:  Shitron said, "  BLNK  ‚Äôs valuation makes no sense" and called the company a ‚Äútotal scheme.‚Äù Left said it is ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù to call   BLNK   an EV stock.  ‚ÄúNew most ridiculous EV stock is $  BLNK  . No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,‚Äù Shitron tweeted.  This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.    I try not to use the      F      word but here goes a bit of simple      Fundamentals      for you tards:    Current market cap:       Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at   NKLA  . Pretty sure   NKLA   reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.    BLNK   has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about   million last quarter.   Last quarter GAAP EPS:    Operating Income:   M  Profit margin:     Return on Equity:   This tells you how well they are spending their money.   Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.  As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams "   SHORT ME!   " Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company.     Final Thoughts    Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at   QS  's 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product.   BLNK   at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on   QS,   but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself   JPOW  ). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.  Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause   BLNK   to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.  Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:    GME   500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)    GME   shares    PLTR   30c May 2021    BB   14c Jan 2023    BLNK   14c Jan 2022     TLDR:   BLNK   is the only vertically integrated EV charging company,   BLNK   has international presence,   BLNK   shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates   BLNK  , so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on   BLNK   and would love to see it run into the ground,   BLNK   is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard,   GME   to the moon.
First time retard going all in first thing monday morning. Too the fucking moon!

Which would you rather regret?
IMO there is no way to watch what is happening with GME and others and not come out without some level of regret and hindsight remorse. The decision over whether or not to buy into this hype, or how much to buy, comes down to one question that you have to answer for yourself:   would you rather regret losing some amount of money if the stock ends up going down, or would you rather regret staying on the sidelines and watching all these other retarded monkeys fill their cages with so many bananas they don't even know what to do with them all?     I think this is an interesting way to frame it and I had a moment of clarity last night that I would way rather lose a few thousand if this goes to zero than watch this go to 5k and not be part of it. As others have said, you are paying to be part of history, this is a donation to the cause, this is insurance against wishing you had some skin in the game.   5000 is not a meme. Apes strong together. We fucking like this stock.   \  (this is not financial advice. Buy and sell stonks based on your own ideas. I am an individual. This is not a collective. My brain is smoother than velvet.)
$BB üö®UPDATED DD üì£ PLEASE DELEVERAGE, HEDGE, or TAKE SOME PROFIT ‚Äî MOVEMENT IS NOT ORGANIC!!!
Not financial advice   Some of you know I‚Äôm a big BB bull on $BB   I love the stock, I love the company, I love John Chen, but it‚Äôs finally clear why BB has been moving the way it has, in tandem with GME   Prem Watsa is a huge BB investor and owns a large stake   Guess who Watsa has beef with? Steve Cohen, the guy supporting Melvin in GME, the final boss so to speak of Point72 with deep ties to Citadel       These are billionaires in financial warfare   Steve Cohen‚Äôs tried to kill Watsa‚Äôs Fairfax fund. In turn killing Blackberry. Cohen‚Äôs group are the hostile players with MASSIVE capital that have been punishing BlackBerry for years   It‚Äôs obvious now why BB SP has been so low in the market. It‚Äôs because Steve Cohen has tried to squash it due to his beef with Watsa. Same thing they‚Äôve been doing with GameStop, but BlackBerry is more personal for Cohen   Don‚Äôt believe me? Look at the daily chart for GME and BB   GME had its first squeeze on Jan 13th, from $20 to $40. 100% gain. This was an astronomical loss for Melvin, who is backed by Cohen   Guess when Blackberry began its epic run? Check the chart... Jan 14th, MASSIVE green candle   December 22nd, random and short BB surge out of nowhere, was so random it shocked me as I thought it might even halt for news. The move faded.   Check GME chart December 22nd, same day GME posted its first big power move from $16 to almost $20. Again Cohen group taking the edge of BB and moving it to GME. Clear as day now.   This BB surge is Cohen‚Äôs group backing off their BB short, pushing the price up, and shoring up enough funds to move to GME which was hemorrhaging HUGE outflows. Retail and momentum exasperated this move in BB  This is so God damn obvious now in hindsight. This is why BB has been moving in tandem with GME   This movement is not organic, has nothing to do with fundamentals, or even Blackberry itself!  This is a war between Cohen (Point72, Citadel, Melvin) and anonymous long hedge funds + retail. These anonymous long hedge funds are either using retail or are siding with retail. In the end, funds don‚Äôt give a shit about anything besides profit. So be careful, they don‚Äôt care about sending any message  Investing in BB right now is investing in Cohen losing his shirt in GME  I know I‚Äôll get hated for this but it‚Äôs true and needs to be said   CONSIDER:   1) Deleverage, get off margin, don‚Äôt YOLO 2) Hedge with puts  3) Scale some out   You‚Äôre investing in between a financial tug of war that runs deep and is directly tied to the outcome of GME. You are not investing in fundamentals of BlackBerry right now! If Cohen uses political leverage which it looks like he has already, stabilizes his position in GME, he will go on the offensive and come back for blood in BB. Just be careful. This is crazy stuff.  Edit: LOL this place has gone wild and become an echo chamber. Fuck it, I hope Cohen gets destroyed and jailed, TO THE FUCKING MOON BOYS!!!!
GME - Be ready for insane volatility, degens
I mean jumping up and down faster than your wife on her boyfriend‚Äôs shmeat throughout the week. You doorknobs think you know pain, looking at a share you're holding dip down 60%? That's nothing- I once reached into my crayon box to eat my favorite color ( Burnt Sienna , I'm a f'ing   gentleman  ) only to see that it was gone.  That's  pain.      Hold. For you newbie r-words, and I've seen a few pendejos that pretend this sub is for financial advice and not a herd of diamond-handed dumbasses shrieking ‚Äú REEEE!‚Äù , a share's dip does not mean you lose money if you   f'ing hold  . "i'M nOrT A fInAnCiAl ANALyst AnD dIs Is NoRt FiNaNcIaL aDvOiCe", no durr i'm not, i just have enough chromosomes (69) to know I only lose when I sell.   For any media that have infiltrated this site, how about you crawl out of MM‚Äôs sore-infested shit tunnels and emphasize that they overleveraged their slippery little fingies and might cause a financial collapse due to their stupidity? Maybe put the blame where it belongs, hmm? Or remind people how senators committing insider trading and buying shares in bodybags before a crippling pandemic is the most fucked up thing imaginable, but they got off scot free? Or talk about the doctors who are paying for med students‚Äô bills with their gains, or any other person passing along their wealth?   For the degens that were here in the last 5 years, and despite having a new account I was one of them (my old one was getting too many ads on shrinking my ground-smacking dong), this sub is not over. This sub is something new. This is all something new.   So go back to your wife, wait patiently for her to finish getting railed by her absolute stud of a lover, and then cook them breakfast. It‚Äôs a new day.   And they‚Äôre hungry.       Position: 121 shares @ $100, I‚Äôm in ‚Äòtil the end.

We all know who the bad guys are
Is the opposite of FOMO, FOLO?
We all know FOMO (fear of missing out) drives momentum in fast rising investments.  With the movement that GME has created, I was wondering what shorters will feel as the price continues to rise and pressures the squeeze.     After seeing GME, shorters in stocks like AMC should be feeling FOLO (fear of losing obscenely) recognizing that that they can be losing more than 100% in a day and seeing borrowing rates rising.   I‚Äôm optimistic that the shares of other BANG stocks (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) will realize increases similar to GME as FOLO sets in causing shorts to race to the exits.
FYI- Beware of SPACs, their entire setup is made for hedge funds and insiders
relevant parts   > SPACs have a complex setup, but Andrew Park, a senior policy analyst with Americans for Financial Reform, argues that there are core problems with the model. ‚ÄúThe first problem is incentives when you issue these SPACs,‚Äù said Park. ‚ÄúThe SPAC sponsor gets 20 percent. No matter what, they get it for free,‚Äù which helps to explain the draw of celebrities, including Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, and government insiders to the space. That means that ‚Äúeveryone is incentivized to do as many deals as possible.‚Äù >  > Because of the incentive misalignment, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs now a worry about how good SPAC sponsors are at due diligence. They automatically get 20 percent for raising the money, ‚Äù Park said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to chase after these private companies and good chance they‚Äôre going to overpay for them because they are acquiring a lofty valuation.‚Äù >  >  >  Finally, ‚Äúthe end investors are not sophisticated,‚Äù with many small retail investors drawn to the SPAC space because of the hype around them ‚Äî in part due to the SPACs‚Äôs ability to make claims about future performance that companies going through a traditional IPO are not able to do. >  > New York University law professor Michael Ohlrogge told the Intercept that hedge funds will buy the SPAC shares at a deep and undisclosed discount prior to going public, which means that they make money regardless of whether the business plan is sound.

Attack on Melvin Capital
WE LIKE THE STOCK
Citadel definitely manipulated the GME short squeeze on Wednesday to allow their buddies in Melvin to exit their trade. That doesn‚Äôt mean that everything any fund does from here on out is somehow related to GME. Don‚Äôt let paranoia get in the way of clear headed thinking.
I‚Äôm holding GME and a small position in SLV.  GME short interest is still at 113%. We can still squeeze it whether it‚Äôs Melvin or some other fund on the other side of the trade.  I posted about SLV and it went viral.  I‚Äôm not from citadel or any hedge fund for that matter. I‚Äôm a WSB peasant who has an account in the low 5 figures.   I‚Äôm even dumb enough that I didn‚Äôt set up my position before posting about SLV so I had to chase calls after they went 10x the next day. I eliminated all chance of myself becoming the next DFV.  Look at my post history if you want to.    I just don‚Äôt want this sub to become about conspiracy theories constantly.  I want trade ideas and I want yolos and we can‚Äôt become a 100% GME sub.  We need to hold GME to continue the squeeze. I totally agree.  But funds are going to be on your side or against you in any number of trades in the future, and other funds will be on the other side.  WSB tips the scales one or another, but the funds with existing positions are the pre-existing weights counterbalancing one another.    Also here‚Äôs a video from last year when all of our spy puts got crushed by JPow announcing unlimited QE. It never broke through but I‚Äôm hoping it helps alleviate fears that somehow I‚Äôm some kind of citadel bot or something.

DON'T FORGET - The First One Is Free‚Ñ¢
Hellow fellow retards. I used to be way more active in /r/wallstreetbets around this time last year, I just wanted to remind you newbies of the saying I saw every where here - FIRST ONE'S FREE.       I decided to download Robinhood and take our $1000-2000 tax return and play the market using WSB. I was a 10/10 autist - slowly figuring out what a strike, expiration, call, etc is from context and Google. I was an autist so obviously I installed Robinhood and immediately applied to trade options. I started trading with the hope that we could pay my wife's college debt off - about $28,000. I didn't think it was realistic but  ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.      It started off rough, I lost about $500. After that, things got great. Within a month of starting I had turned my couple grand into $8,700 with positions (mostly calls) in: AMD, Intel, Square, PLUG, the MEME STONKS of that time.      I started to think damn, maybe I COULD make $28,000 to pay off this debt with. Then COVID19 wrecked fucking everything. My account dropped from $8,700 to $2,000 slowly over the next month.      Some other retards got on here and convinced everyone of the TRIPLE WITCHING HOUR which would cause SPY or something to fucking BLOW. I remember almost going all in on that play and I was so glad I didn't - because nothing fuckin happened.      After that I never really had the time to get back into it as my job got really busy due to covid and my wife and I were in the midst of transitioning to the "vanlife lifestyle" (its a very cheap/frugal way of life and you experience so much more). I wanted to get back into this with my little bit of buying power left today ($900) but just never made it priority.      MORAL OF THE STORY: THE FIRST ONE IS FREE. SOMETIMES ITS BEST TO TAKE YOUR TENDIES, BUT YOU BETTER FUCKING HOLD YOUR GME. Maybe I'll start playing with my $900.
I got nothing to offer but time and support for y'all. So I made this movie poster-style shit.

High IQ Tards, what are the possible scenarios in GME right now?
Before I start, check my comment history - I am not a hedgie shill or bot trying to fear monger and manipulate people. Due to the influx of new people, the sub has turned into a mega echo-chamber and I feel we are missing answers to some key questions that would otherwise be answered by the 2 or 3 people here that actually fuck their own and our wives.   It was explained over and over again that the shorts haven't covered (fuck them and the media for trying to say they did) and that the price can only go up as long as they haven't covered, because at some point, they have to. And that is fine.  Every single retard also has understood that 1000$ is in fact a meme, because we're not selling under 10,000$. Got it.   What nobody has properly explained though is the  stability and confidence in the market and its rules . There have been posts saying that Goldman is lying when they say the market could collapse, which I also understand. But can please someone explain to me and anyone else that might still have some further cash to dump into GME  - Can they actually change the rules and freeze trading on GME or manipulate it otherwise? - If they do, what implications would that have? (Can they do it legally? If they do it illegally like RH, can they get away with it and with what would that leave us? - If what the IKBR guy has said is actually true and there is some potential for clearing houses and brokers to fail, what does that mean for our gains?  I don't care if this squeeze blows up the economy and the market, because it's not our fault but Wall St. fault. All I care is if the Tendieman will make it through the rough sea. I mean, Michael Burry got his money too when the market collapsed in 2008, right? I am 100% sure that without any fuckery, the squeeze has to happen. I am also sure that when it happens, we all become millionaires. But what are possible fuckery strategies they might try and can they actually pull it off?  Thanks my tards and please mods, don't delete this! It might actually add to the cause!
DFV with hidden message HOLDDDDDDDDD
The greatest WallStreetBets story of all time.
I maintain that the epitome of WSB is /u/flopsie123‚Äôs accidental overnight ownership of $23,000,000 of SPY with a $50,000 account. The best part is that he came out of it with a $112,000 profit.     Almost three years ago, OP had tried to make a quick $2000 profit by selling barely-out-of-the-money Put option spreads shortly before those options expired. Happy with his quick cash, OP called it a day and didn't look at his phone again that night. In after-hours trading, the price of SPY dipped below the higher strike in the Put spread, allowing his counterparty to exercise their right to sell him thousands of shares of SPY at a profit. He got assigned 86,300 shares of SPY and had no clue until he checked his phone the following day.  The next morning, by sheer dumb luck, SPY opened above the strike price where he had been assigned the shares. It was dropping, but there was a small window of about 15 minutes during which his 86,300 shares, an embarssment of riches if there ever was one, could be sold for a profit. If SPY had opened lower, or if he hadn't noticed in time to sell immediately at the open, OP‚Äôs absurd level of leverage would have wiped him out and put him into serious debt. If those shares had been held through the end of that trading day, he would have owed $700,000.  What about the other option in the Put spread, the one he had bought to limit his exposure to SPY falling too low? Remember, the options were expiring on that day, so his protection expired that night as well, leaving him exposed for the open.  There‚Äôs a reason OP‚Äôs originally-intended trading strategy is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúpicking up pennies in front of a steamroller.‚Äù  This post was peak WSB because it had everything - ill-advised risky trade, poor understanding of the forces involved, flaw in eTrade's risk management system, yet still manages to have a happy, autistic ending.    - OP had to pay interest to eTrade for owning millions of dollars of SPY, essentially on borrowed money. Apparently the interest on $23,000,000 overnight is $8000, so his actual profit was $104,000 before taxes.
Tomorrow is a big day
I am holding and I am buying. They‚Äôve had the weekend to decide what they‚Äôre going to do. If I was in their shoes, allowing a game squeeze to 1000 and knocking the price down because they think people will sell is not a bad move for them to make.  Think about the hype of this subreddit, 1k is not a meme is the mindset of most people still. we are sitting at 320 AH, and the germans are going to have to do some work to get us higher in the pre market tomorrow. The goal is to close green EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS WEEK. It‚Äôs the way that GME gets squeezed. A realistic way is if we maintain hype. Billboards, planes flying fuck you robinhood. Remember that we are not actually organized. And tomorrow is the start of what I think is the most crucial day for GME. The swings will be wild, a lot of people have transitioned to fidelity and more and more are coming. We need the eurobros to hold for us. They will tire us, they will start to seed doubt into your mind. Do not let them. Hold strong, hold steady, the squeeze has not happened yet.   Diamond. Fucking. Hands.  EDIT: REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE DELAY FOR FIDELITY.  EDIT 2: i‚Äôm also not giving financial advice.  EDIT 3: BEWARE THE BOTS AND THE ACCOUNTS PLANTING DOUBT.  EDIT 4: To answer some questions -> Fidelity is an app that is currently unrestricted. Buy game at your own discretion, I firmly believe that shorts haven‚Äôt covered, and that the massive amounts of bots and MM is proof that they‚Äôre getting more worried by the day. We are winning. We have won small battles, big battles, overcame walls, and so long as everyone here does their fucking job, this WILL succeed. I believe in all of you.
Just realized I may be screwed out of many tendies. Broker only allows limit orders up to $9,999. What happens if GME goes past that and I put in a market order.
In the event that GME does trade above $10,000 how would I be able to realize the gains?   I don‚Äôt have enough shares for one whole lot (less than 100). Does the rule that market makers have to fill odd lots at best price apply here?   I don‚Äôt have a limit order now, plan on putting one when it gets closer to my ultimate target price of 40k. Laugh if you want. I‚Äôve been screwed by shorters in weedstocks that drove prices down over 90% across the industry so I need 9900% gains just to get back to where I was.   For the unfamiliar, all types of nefarious parties in the cannabis space would frequently short a stock and then buy into a raise at a discount to close their position shortly after. The biggest cannabis company curaleaf is built through the profits the founder‚Äôs investment fund made off shorting canadian cannabis. He actually bragged about his strategy on BNN Bloomberg.  So tldr I‚Äôm already jaded and willing to lose all as already have lost all. So will hold until Pluto or bust. Hence 40k target.  Thank you everyone for any insight.   If not obvious:       GME       ETA: I‚Äôm not asking about feasibility of a price above 10,000. I‚Äôm asking a practical question.   What happens with a market order, can they fill it with a random bid below the current bid/ask?  I only have a few shares and hoping that using a market order at what I consider to be good time won‚Äôt screw me over somehow. Thanks!  ETA 2: I‚Äôm not expecting the price to stay at an elevated level for any length of time. Depending on trading action, I will of course adjust my lofty targets. I just wanted to know what happens in a one in a million type situation. That will last for maybe minutes, maybe half an hour and then crash down just as quickly.   To all those spreading fud: crazier things have happened in this market than a stock trading at absurd valuations for a short period of time in the middle of a trading session. I just don‚Äôt want to be caught not knowing what to do if it happens.

Buying deep in the money   effect on $GME price
, let‚Äôs say, theoretically, I buy 5 $200 call options and exercise them tomorrow.  With such low liquidity and high short volume (Thanks Melvin) is there possibility that there may not be enough shares to deliver?  I keep reading about the possibility of there being more shares outstanding than the current market cap for $GME.  Instead of buying shares, is it better to buy calls then exercise them?  Asking for a friend.  I‚Äôm a student and just wondering....

Collapse of Big Players
Hey fellas,  I have seen a lot of posts discussing about holding shares of securities that have been shorted by big players in the market. I completely understand what that will do to those who have shorted the stock but I have been thinking about those people who have given their hard earned monies to these big players to invest on their behalf. Sure, Melvin and Citadel and the likes of them have done stupid things that has manipulated the markets for years but I wonder what you all think about the economy as a whole if these funds were to go down?    I honestly have no idea who has given big dollars to these funds but wouldn't it be safe to assume that there are probably some pension funds, 401k, education, endowment funds held by them? While the decentralized power of WSBers has really got the entire financial markets spinning, I hope our actions would not result in a crash of markets due to a spiraling effect of these funds trying to cover their positions by selling other securities and creating the downward pressure in the markets.    This also touches a bit on the moral side of the things where a few million of us here will benefit at the expense of world economies. Maybe I am completely wrong and hoping people around here would shed some light on this.   Thanks.
NYSE tweet "hghghg" - Symbolic interpretation (Buy GME)
Hg is the chemical symbol for Mercury.    Mercury is also the Roman god of financial gain, commerce, luck, trickery and thieves.  Mercury was known to the greeks as hermes.  Hermes Trismagestrus means Hermes thrice great.  If Hermes and Mercury are the same, then Hermes thrice great = Mercury Mercury Mercury = HgHgHg.  Hermes Trismagestrus was thought to have known the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe - Alchemy, Magic, and Astrology.  Alchemists turn things into gold.    The number 3 is also symbolic of Abundance, or opportunity.  So either NYSE is saying that there's a lot of opportunity for financial gain, the only question is whether or not it's by buying GME, or milking the retail investors for all they've got.  Hg is also a private equity firm that targets buyouts primarily in Europe and the US.  So maybe they're saying their name 3 times in hopes they show up.  Do what you will with this knowledge.
We're not causing the next crash, we just prevented billionaire-gang mega-short HFs from causing the next one on purposeü§£
Or so I'd like to believe at least.   They had almost done setting it all up. All these sketchy HF, over-shorting poor brick'n'mortar stores to oblivion (if they go bankrupt the shorts keep the gains tax-free for magical boomer reasons, of course  ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)  For real tho, you know what I love the most about all this, name one person you know who had money in these sleazy hedge funds? That's right, you don't know any, because you're not a sleazy billionaire.   9 GME    .... and one more up their  @ üí≤üí≤:
Why Robinhood is lying about clearing house issues
1) Robinhood launched it's own clearing house in 2018. And is supposedly moved away from Apex clearing house, the clearing house that other brokerages have named as the one that placed restrictions.     "In 2018, we launched Clearing by Robinhood, our in-house clearing platform. Before this conversion, customers' trades were cleared by Apex Clearing. Since the conversion, customers' trades have been cleared by Robinhood Securities. "  Straight from RH's own website        2) Robinhood initially said that the decision was to "protect their customers" and did not mention anything about clearing house issues. They then CHANGED their statement and released new statements saying it was due to clearing house issues.     3) The CEO came on CNBC and literally said there was no liquidity issue. Although who knows with reports of RH getting additional funds afterwards. But why not mention that you were having some liquidity issues meeting the clearing house requirements in this interview? In fact it was not mentioned at all in the entire interview.

Some recent thoughts on PLTR
I have a new round of retarded thoughts for people who still remember this god tier company.  1. After all of the ARK buying and increase in % weight for PLTR   in my opinion it seems like we might be due for another solid run. See charts below:        2) Next we have the news that the Biden administration increased the value of a standing contract PLTR  has with ICE. The increase was only 2million but it tells me that the Biden administration loves PLTR  and will continue to do business with them. Contract renewals are guaranteed and new contracts way more likely. See below:     3) And finally who doesn't love salted nuts? See Below:     Position:
FUCK SILVER. Here's the move AFTER the squeeze has squoze: Cannabis!  üå± üå±
EDIT: Downvote all you want SLV shills. Marijuana ain't goin anywhere and neither am I. üòé See comments for SLV shills exposed. üòé  What's up apes, autists, retards, degenerates, and every other person with fuckin  üçÜ's. I first want to say my 5 shares of GME at $310 love every last one of you idiots, and  I'm NOT FUCKIN LEAVIN . Our job isn't done, but at this point it's a waiting game for Melvin to realize this sub   will stay retarded longer than they stay solvent   We  like  this stock, and we  like  that game. In the words of the wise Papa Chamath "I will win."          BUT WHAT ABOUT AFTER THE SQUEEZE IS SQUOZE?   What are you planning to do with your platter of tendies and squeeze cheese? Looking for ideas? Hear me out retards about a stock I like, and no I'm not gonna TLDR. I need the smart apes to hear me out.     I'm sorry SLVer surfers, but I am not one of you      plus y'all are looking awful botty and shilly.      Canopy Growth Corp $CGC. ~~We could force a national conversation about marijuana reform and free millions of people, from reddit.~~ On top of being a great company   that is already the official sports drink for TWO NBA teams   they represent a unique opportunity to make tendies, continue to make an impact on the world around us with our tendies,   and free fellow retards  . While we have all eyes on us, instead of taking on JP Morgan, let's help out the   millions   of future retards currently sitting in prison wishing they could join our moon missions. The current administration promised a lot prior to the election, and I think we need to help our fellow retards missing out on our revolution(s). APES TOGETHER STRONG.       ~~"BuT CaN We SqUeEzE tHem??"   Yes, retards we fookin can.   To the tune of 1 billion dollars at the moment, and that's assuming those shorts didn't attend Melvin Short Academy and not learn how to close a position. They think stonks go down, but we know they only go down because of them. Stonks literally only go up.~~    No one wants to be seen as targeting shorts   and I want to make it clear, that is NOT the intention here. This is a company with wildly large     catalysts     coming very soon, and already starting to boil.   EVERYONE SHOULD DEMAND TO KNOW THE SHORT LOGIC   instead of defending long positions, especially with an amazing year ahead. Why would you short this stock? To me it's probably the same people who think weed turns you into a couch. You know the commercial.   If you're still reading, here comes the fookin  's:        .   This keg is ready to blow it just needs a little retard push   but it doesn't end there. There's more clear catalysts, and I again   do not understand the short thesis               . Mexico would become the world's largest recreational marijuana market in the world, which ~~IS GOD DAMN MASSIVE~~ I guess you could call a catalyst for a recreational marijuana company, like $CGC.         . I'm really not sure if Mexico is even factored into these calculations either.      I could go on and on, but if ~~squeeze cheese~~, tendies, helping kidnapped retards, and changing the world isn't enough for you with your investment, I do not know what to tell you man.       Am retard. Not advice
A demonstration that "protect the retail investors" arguments are in bad faith
Broker apps do not care about protecting retail investors from market mechanics that have been known to be exploited actively for many many years already.  This is not a mistake. This is not a bug it's a feature. Just, not for you, the retail investor. You should have emptored your caveat.  [Look at this trade screen](  )  On most (all?) app the default type of buy order is the market order.  Not something that should automatically be limited, but something easily exploited by current big fintech.  If you send a market order on a stock that has HFT short sharks waiting for you, they will see your order coming years in advance. Before your order even makes it to New York city, they will have bought every single ask between you and their highly overpriced ask.   The dumb robot executing your trade will buy at ANY price without question because he HAS BEEN CONFIGURED THIS WAY BY DEFAULT by your broker.   Yes, it was your job to know all of this and now a shark is eating your dick, should have stayed out of the water, you intellectually challenged retail investor.  This is how they "protect" the retail investor see. It's just a simple, plausible, oversight at worst. And each investor will get bit only once, just a little nibble.  Just in the same way we buy our little 4 shares of GME, just once, no biggie. Protect the investors yes ?  If they wanted to protect the investors, the minimum they would have done is make the default a limit order of 110% of the current stock price. Or something more sophisticated, but the they didn't and they cannot plead ignorance for something out in the open for years, something they have netflix documentaries about.      Extended discussion  The supposed ideal market is a lie, it pretends equality of opportunity in the mechanics of the games however no such thing exists. Traders nearer to the exchange have "latency privilege" and can leverage this for a permanent edge over all other players.   (journalists and politicians, understand this distinction, latency is the big deal, not the many trades per millisecond ones, if all participants had functionally the same latency, there would be no problem (well, there probably would be other problems))  Until the latency privilege is not functionally eliminated, there is no equality of opportunity in the market, the market is not a leveled playing field (duh, it will probably never be and to claim otherwise is ideology bordering on misinformation).   TL;DR   Send the latency supremacists to the gulags is what I'm saying, stop GME buys was not about protecting retail investors, because they did not care to do that beforehand, as shown in the very code of the broker's app. The stock market is a retail meat grinder which is fitting since it was designed from the beginning  to leech fat off from workers, so why not double dip and eat their savings too !
I LIKE THESE STOCKS-the pinnacle of musical production
CiTaDeL bOtS pUsHiNg SiLvEr!
Since some of you are calling out SLV...  A lot of you are pushing the whole SLV Citadel conspiracy theory. If anyone talks about why silver is a good play they get called a hedge fund bot trying to distract from GME. They get told to stick to GME and AMC. Well guess what...   Citadel isn‚Äôt  !     And notice how BB, BBBY, NOK, etc. haven‚Äôt been called out as being distractions when   Citadel also has    Maybe you people calling silver a scam are the real Citadel shills. I mean, you are distracting from GME and you are trying to allocate funds to stocks that Citadel has calls in. It seems like some of you are just pushing the tickers you have positions in.  Or it could just be that these hedge funds own a little of everything. Your goal was to go after Melvin, not to prevent new plays.  Disclaimer: I have March SLV calls and soon to be in some SILJ too. Not a financial advisor. Not financial advice. Just pointing out the hypocrisy of trying to prevent a play that actually makes a good amount of sense.

MELVIN DOWN 53%
GME How do we know they didn‚Äôt cover yet? No newbie responses please.
Can somebody (who has been on WSB for longer than a few weeks!!!) please explain to me how we know that they haven‚Äôt covered their short positions yet? Everyone keeps spamming everywhere and assuming that‚Äôs the case but how do we know that.  The trading volume has been extremely large all week, the numbers on volume are large enough that they could have covered multiple times.  So why is everyone so certain that they didn‚Äôt yet?  Also the 140% short float everyone keeps referencing. That number is at least 1 week old. We have know idea what it is now right? Please explain
HOW TO BYPASS GAMESTOP BUY RESTRICTIONS: EXERCISE CALLS
mods pleas PLEAS    This has been posted before but I think it‚Äôs VERY important to know, maybe even should be pinned.   We don‚Äôt know if/which brokerages will be instituting buy-order restriction‚Äôs on GME etc this week.   If anyone who is interested (and can afford to) still wants to buy shares, know that it is still possible to EXERCISE your call options.  By exercising, they are required to give you the 100 shares you bought.    How does it work?     ELI5:  each Call contract is for 100 shares at the strike price.  You‚Äôd want to purchase deep ITM Calls, with minimal extrinsic value left in the contract.  On Robinhood, this is manifested as the ‚ÄúTo Break Even%‚Äù, where this number would ideally be 0% for immediate exercise.     On other brokerages such as ToS displayed in the link as well, you may just have to do some quick maths to figure out the relative costs.     How do I know if exercising is worth it?    Immediately Exercising a Call is supposed to be similar to buying 100 shares outright, right?  But since immediate exercise isn‚Äôt how options are usually used, there will be some extra costs involved.  Math:  If $GME is at $300, it would cost $30,000 to buy 100 shares at $300 each.     100 shares = $30,000    If we do this via a (theoretical) option: Lets say GME is at $300 still.  And lets say the $45 strike Call for   costs ‚Äú$285‚Äù each.  You‚Äôll pay that $285 to buy the contract.  Now if you want to exercise that contract, you will pay another $45 for each of the 100 shares you‚Äôre exercising the right to buy. In this example, (45+285) 100 = 33,000   100 shares = $33,000      (strike price + contract cost) x 100 = the cost to immediately buy 100 shares via options     Obviously this isn‚Äôt ideal,  but if RobbingHood et. al. continue their restrictions, this will likely be how I will purchase shares of a stock I like.   I would likely be paying an extra premium per share as you saw,  BUT WHO CARES ABOUT PAYING EXTRA IF WE‚ÄôRE GOING TO THE MOON ANYWAY      How do I exercise an option (on RobbingHood??    On RH there‚Äôs a handy little ‚ÄúExercise‚Äù button when you click on your Call.  You‚Äôd just click through the screens to do it.       I‚Äôm sorry if formatting is bad and the explanation was  quick and dirty  but I have a feeling many of us will be stuck holding and unable to buy shares outright once again.  If you have questions I Will try to answer in the comments, and if anyone has something better to explain then feel free.   not financial advice, dumbass     get fucked CNBC   mods pls post edit fucking forgot   I‚Äôm so sorry

This is the current link to the article:    (Edit: Click the above, and you will notice that it was changed)  I am looking to see if anyone has an original screenshot or way to find the article as it was first written. It was originally painting redditors as "Barbarians" looking to "Sack Wall Street", as the url explains. Within a few hours, the WSJ changed it to not paint us as barbarians.  I want a screenshot so that I can provide proof that the media covered up painting us as barbarians. Does anyone have a screenshot of the title and article?  I tried looking into the WayBackMachine but it does not have the original article.
Meet Kjetill Sterne, the powerlifting viking who stomped the shorts on Friday
My fellow apes,   Did you ask yourselves why there were so many changes in the price of GME  last few seconds on Friday?   Allegedly, it was because the shorts tried to launch a massive short ladder at the last minute, just to be... Destroyed by a massive buy order which sent the price back to 320 $.   It turns out we may owe the buy order to this guy - a freaking powerlifting viking which beat the shorts' algoritms at their own game.       Someone please contact Chris Hemsworth to play this guy in the movie.   Stay strong, my  br√≥√∞ir.   Edit : this legendary video :

ENDGAME DD- GAME OVER THEORY
Disclaimer I own 23 shares of GME at 273 and I‚Äôm bull. This is not investment advice.    Are you wondering when, how, if this will all be over you‚Äôve come to the right post. This ENDGAME DD is about no stock in particular and shouldn‚Äôt be taken as investment advice.  So your answer? If you haven‚Äôt seen this post please check it out. I think it does an ok job at theorizing the point at which a large short has to cover and how we get there.     User does a great job explaining that there will be massive volatility if we are to go forward. There‚Äôs also a good theory of a pre-squeeze price and post-squeeze price where all holders make value $. No squeeze has happened yet, only a small exit of short positions leveraged back into more shorts.  Things the user forgot to mention as a strategy for someone bullish other than buy and hold.   Other methods can be used to drive up prices.   Remove your shares from the available short position!!   DO IT NOW then tell a friend    GOOGLE SAYS: Phone your broker and put an order in saying that you wish to place   your shares   for sale at, for argument's sake, double today's price. As they are 'on order' they   cannot   be lent out by your broker and in turn, you are reducing the amount of   'free shares  ' out there that can be used for   shorting   purposes.  Shorts increased their position!   If you have   any   stock you want to increase in value, set a sell limit order for what you think is ‚Äúfair value‚Äù, another thing brokers are limiting.  Buying accelerates the process way faster! 21 years is the estimate when they will be bust at current $300 value. I think it was an overestimate that can be much faster with buys. Buys with the conviction that the leadership from is now solid. Buys where you trust others to see the company and its stock growing. Buys because you like the stock. Anyone can buy, from almost anywhere! Asia, EU, Canada, US, find out if you can purchase too.     Taking away available shares to short and buying could reduce the estimate to an untenable short term position. Period    The last thing not mentioned is a margin call. Oh did you invest on margin and over-leverage your position on GME like these hedge funds?  Prepare for an unexpected call when the clearing firm calls in and asks you to meet minimum deposit requirements or sells your position. However, this only happens if bulls are   quick and consistent  . Volatility needs to be so insane and price so high that shorts need to clear out and cut losses so quickly that they never have the capacity to short again.  The reason Robinhood said Fuck You, 1 share a piece was that their DTCC deposit/cash on hand requirements went way up. No speculation, just a fact. They, unlike other brokers, have 56% of 13 million known users who have a stake in heavily shorted Gamer Stock. In theory, if 30% more users bought 1 share of a $312 stock that would add $1,216,800,000 of value. Hedges lose long before that, but 56% is rookie numbers, we can get that to 99%.  Now read this:    In theory, just by buying and holding you could force Robinhood and other brokers to call in their investment from leveraged shorts. Ding ding ding. Three shitron lemons just flashed in a row and paid out.   However, investing isn‚Äôt for everyone. Huge volatility for your one allowance of share can be involved. If you buy high and sell low that is as much of a loss as someone who shorted a position that was sound long term. My investment advice has always been only put in what you can lose, never 140%.  Buy a ticket to the show. They could sell out quickly. DVF bought 55,000 tickets at such a low price, but low is relative to what is the current high.   Personally, I think $300 for your ticket to the show is a good deal for the    HEDGIES LOSS PORN but you have to hold it to enter   .  TLDR; If you have rocket fuel, we will be going to the moon.

DO NOT BUY SILVER!
Do not try to buy precious metals in the next week while China is celebrating the beginning of their Year of the Metal Ox. Wait until after you are done holding GME, even though you are planning to hold GME forever.  Anything other than GME is a distraction. Since you are holding GME forever, you are never allowed to invest in anything else ever again. Holding GME is your life's work and requires your undivided attention. There is no possible way anyone would ever talk about anything other than GME unless they wanted you to sell GME. Even when it's a weekend and you can't sell GME anyway.  All of your money should be in your brokerage so you shouldn't even have any money available to buy bullion with. Your brokerage would never betray you.   Don't think anything of the fact that online bullion dealers have frozen your ability to buy silver. The statements on their front pages saying they have to restrict your purchase ability due to unprecedented market conditions are nothing like any other statements you've seen from anyone recently. Don't think about it.   The US dollar will never lose value again. Biden is going to make an announcement tomorrow that the federal reserve will burn a pile of money to reverse inflation, I can feel it. Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies.   Pay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.  Pay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could  hypothetically  exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.  The important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.  Don't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.  And most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $  trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.  EDIT - We've got a usual stickied thread sorted by new, thanks mods! Good to see my satirical post rapidly becoming outdated.

PSA to new traders. Taxes are real.
Please do the basic research and know how taxes will be affected by your position.   AM I TELLING YOU TO SELL OR BUY?   NO     I'm telling you to consider how much you gain during this fiasco and make sure to put money aside for taxes. I keep seeing donation posts which are great and tax deductible but if you're holding stock or options for short duration (less than a year) which like 99% of you, your taxes on gains will be higher.   Do your research and understand what you owe uncle sam at the end. If you make 50k on $800 don't donate 5k thinking you have 45k to spend and buy a new Tesla expecting tax season to be the same.   Buy and sell whatever you want. Just be careful.  Edit: since this blew up, thought I'd mention citron decided to stop short selling/analyses and "pivot" as they realize they "became the establishment."   You fuckers did it.

DD: Broader Markets Won't Crash, Buy SPY CALLS, VIX PUTS, and HOLD GME
TL;DR:   Last week's broder market selloff was likely spurred by fear that the we were going to crash the whole system by diamond handing GME and its ilk. The overall effect of the demise of these few short sellers won't be large enough to crash the whole system. Over the next one to two weeks, SPY likely to come back, VIX likely to go down. Keep holding GME (if you like the stock).  More details in the full text of the below Bloomberg article for the few of you whose attention span exceeds 10 seconds. I   bolded   the important parts.     # GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion    surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those   bearish positions probably aren‚Äôt big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds  .  That‚Äôs the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market‚Äôs capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those   most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than   of the $43 trillion market.    Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week‚Äôs selling -- the worst in the S&P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they‚Äôre unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.   ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand,   we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don‚Äôt have an outsize influence  ,‚Äù said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. ‚Äú  The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up  .‚Äù  Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a   basket shows.  While the   S&P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly  . To JPMorgan Chase & Co.‚Äôs strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a ‚Äúshort-lived technical tumble.‚Äù With earnings improving and   consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.   To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of   for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020‚Äôs pandemic market.  ‚ÄúAlthough the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,‚Äù Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop‚Äôs ticker. ‚ÄúWhile we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.‚Äù  By Barclays‚Äôs tally,   short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves  . The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.  ‚ÄúWe remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,‚Äù Deshpande said. ‚Äú  The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low  .‚Äù

GME: The wrong side of the equity
Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Obligatory: I'm long a single share of GME, am not very smart, and you shouldn't take financial advice from anyone in this sub. This is opinion only in nature and i aim only to discuss possibilities and their outcomes.  Tldr at bottom:  Okay, WSB is simply a very large pool of investors who are concerned for the capital of short sellers investors. We all individually decided that these HF's took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.  We have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF's lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.  So here's the skinny: No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren't dying from the interest yet. They are holding.  But what if their capital left? The questions needed to be answered are  1.) "what HF's are actively short GME, AMC, ETC. "  2.) Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).  3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF's risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?  4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf's clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?  I'm going to guess that most people aren't aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb.   It's not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn't go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.  Poke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.  Edit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF's bidding. This isn't a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf's who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who's assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF's solvency out.   Tldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors /   pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions. Possibly rug pulling short sellers capital for a checkmate. Excluding any lock up periods
Reminder on GME, why we like the stock
GME       This has escalated faster than my dick when DFV posts, While pretty much everyone who bought into GME sub 20 knew there were massive tendies to be made, not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this.     Lets take a step back and review the FACTS, amidst the bot attacks, fake news, and overall noise coming from the powers at be.  1.   Gamestops long term prospects look good: marketing, $$$ and more $$$    fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model, thankfully, it has. We can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for re  a business that was on its way out. He involved himself on the board, brought in his former chewy associates, and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot. Gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form. Obviously when board members and c-suits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company, if you go and   you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management, until 2019 which helped create the situation we are in, if the people running the company do not care about the value of it, they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed. So yay, management now gives a fuck. we have our first ingredient,    aligned $$$     Now on to the second ingredient, big $$$  Gamestop has to finance its operations for 2019 and 2020 as it went deep into the red, the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status, and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again, which with shit management is to be expected. With the new interest from stakeholders, GME took off, gaining market cap, and opening up a new avenue of financing. Even if GME hit a modest market cap of lets say  , they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much. But now with a market cap approaching 20+bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital, hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering.   Gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock, so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash. Which in turn means they can pay off their debt, increase their credit rating, and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again.      third ingredient: attention and faith.  self explanatory, the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing, now literally everyone and their mother will know about GME forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back. Now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for MASSIVE TENDIES     now when we combine, aligned monetary interests, with new financing capability, huge investor confidence on management AND brand awareness. well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam.   with these few ingredients GME can cook up so many tendies, we already know they are working on making PC gaming more mainstream, and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams, think the nintendo center in NYC for the heads who know, gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together, or maybe hangout and have a beer. adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and I expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop. maybe not exactly like a video game bar, but some form of live social-gaming experience is something that I think is highly likely they will integrate.   2. The financial institutions have their back against the wall, nothing can save them other than a gov bailout, its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down.  There is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece, i do not think they will become insolvent because you know, wall street, but there is no way they do not take heavy losses. The sheer grit from new comers, lurkers, big names, and OGs is unspeakable. people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say, BEARS R FUKT HEDGIES EAT COCK, which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming. They have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things. They know how much money they control, how to influence the right people, and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want? well jokes on them cuz my wife's boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain. And guess what? SO CAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS GAME NOW, people are just buying, buying, and then buying some more, no matter the financial hurt, the buy side pressure has not and will not degrade(maybe when we hit 500+ a share since a lot of people might get priced out then) but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market. So they are in a pretty pickle. the longer they wait us out, the fewer shares they have to work with. The higher the price the more they bleed, the more they short, the worse it gets. Basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are, so HOLD because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell, become distracted, create FUD, prevent us from buying, restrict options, you name it.      All we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys, the challenge, the real challenge ( that gives us our diamond hands) is waiting. yes PATIENCE, as buffet has once said, " The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient". WE ARE THE PATIENT, WE ARE STRONG TOGETHER, WE ARE THE FUCKING PLAYERS. And the hedgies know it. they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money, and each day they have to    work    to remain afloat. Every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy GME when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital.      TLDR; GameStop has all the ingredients to generate, real long term value for their shareholders, be patient. The shorts have already lost, its a matter of how much now, be patient, the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves, while we just has to scroll WSB and find confirmation bias DD like this one. pretty simple, be patient, watch shorts cry, make unlimited tendies. DO NOT LET ANYONE INFLUENCE YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL GME, MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND STAND BY THEM. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, THESE ARE MY OPINIONS, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE     420 share @  , GAMESTONK
I was a corpo, but now I see: WSB was right all along.
In ye old days when dinosaurs only dreamed of moon-yachts, budding traders slung $UVXY, and tendies were of $NUGT not calls, I opened a brokerage account with an imposing $200. After some adventures with Ol' Yeller, I was up some 30% that could finance an entire charcuterie instead of ramen. It was a blast, and I was ready to YOLO my cheese and my crackers into the sky. Enter $NVAX, with late stage trials that would dominate a deadly baby flu. You see, I had a whole $260, an A in an undergrad portfolio class, and knew nothing about vaccines; it literally could not go tits up. A few days later, as biotech do, my cheese was cut and a thing of dreams.  After my cheese portfolio tanked, I though maybe the smart money was on to something. My YOLO didn't take me to the moon, but mooned me instead. Naturally, I joined the dark side. Closed my position, went to grad school, helped write textbooks, taught analysts, and went full corpro.  But see, working for the man is not the same as being the man. It took my time, it stressed me away from my high school sweetheart, and it wasn't going to pay enough for studying full time again. Mid pandemic, I said fuck it to my own fundamentals, and YOLO'd on myself by quitting. Though I can't have my time, girlfriend, or education money anyway now, I don't regret it for a minute.  I know that this is the way because you tendie trackers and the markets confirmed it. You took GME to the moon, penetrating billionaire portfolios. Ol' Yeller is back, now queen of the Treasury. And most poetically of all? $NVAX went to the moon just last Friday. Even though I didn't get to ride these rockets, I did learn a lesson: don't let your memes settle as dreams.   You were right all along, WSB.   Not financial advice

The only Nokia DD you need.
First and foremost this is not financial advice. You use your money exactly how you see fit and take responsibly for your own trades. Secondly this is not a "squeeze" play.  Nokia is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world, as well as one of the front running companies for 5G.  Nokia now has a significant hold in all of the world‚Äôs early 5G adopters. Including deals with the top four communication service providers in the United States as well as the top three providers in Japan and Korea. Multinational contracts and deals have placed Nokia at the top when it comes to 5G and it will only be getting bigger when 5G is more accessible to people like us. Last week we ran Nokia up to almost 9 dollars before multiple halts stopped all the momentum. Then the trading restrictions on Robinhood and other brokerages hurt the momentum even more. I believe this was to help the hedge funds cover there ass before the inevitable movement up were going to have in the future. With trade restrictions being lifted on most platforms and earnings coming on Thursday we should see a big move up. This is a value company, with huge room for growth. The hedge funds manipulated this hard dropping from 6 to   We will not let them win and short another great company into the ground. Nokia is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market. The more we go up the more hedge funds will try and short. Buy shares and hold for a long time. This is a great company.  1. Most essential 5G patents in the world. 2. Fastest 5G speeds recorded. 3. Controls over 27% of the 5G market. 4. First company contracted to set up internet on the moon (NASA/SpaceX) 5. Multi billion dollar settlements from ongoing litigations with Mercedes Benz and Lenovo. 6. Technology provider and main collaborator of the National Security Center of Excellence 5G Cybersecurity Project (Federal 5G project). 7. Selected to be the main collaborator of the Hexa 6G European Union Project. 8. Pending Department of Defense contracted yet to be awarded. 9. Sealed a contract with T-Mobile for US 5G roll out. 10. Taking market share share from Huawei, already has secured multi year deals with important Chinese companies. 11. Blackrock increased their position 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before. (7% increase)

Something to Keep in Mind for the Week Ahead
SELL LIMIT ORDERS CAN BE SEEN BY THE MARKET      Before breaking down why this is important, let's quickly recap some of the highlights of last week:  GameStop had one of its first big pops to open the market Wednesday and remained volatile all day. Thursday, it opened with another significant pop, and then HFs employed some perfectly timed and very illegal market manipulation tactics. Some of the largest brokerages with the most retail investors blocked the purchase of GME shares, and only allowed the current investors to sell the stock. HFs coupled this restriction in free trade with what is commonly referred to as a short ladder attack, which is another form of market manipulation to fabricate the illusion that a stock is plummeting. Newly invested retail traders watched this play-out over the course of the day, and with only the option to sell and seeing their initial investment plummet quickly probably sold the shares, freeing them for Hedge Funds to scoop up.   Friday morning opened with another pop and the SEC issued a statement that they will be closely monitoring the price volatility of certain stocks, which put HFs on notice, and publicly acknowledged that they are paying attention to the situation. Meanwhile, trade across many of the brokerages that had previously blocked their customers from buying reopened the option to buy, but with significant restrictions.       TL;DR RE: LAST WEEK       Starting Wednesday, GME opened everyday with a big pop likely due to the fever pitch of news and interest combined with HFs slowly covering their positions. Tomfoolery was   as HFs tried to   down a potentially imminent squeeze.       SELL LIMIT ORDERS       Okay, so why are sell limit orders so important this coming week? Or many of you may even be asking WHAT IS a sell limit order? To borrow a very succinct analogy: if you are an   holding a  , the sell limit order is the number you tell your brokerage you're willing to sell your  for. This number can be seen by the market, and the HFs can see these numbers, but more importantly, they can see ALL of them. This is key because depending on how long you've been tracking GME on WSB, you have likely seen several comments saying something along the lines of "$  IS NOT A MEME" and it has continually increased from 1k, 5k, 10k, etc. Which is where we get to the meat of this post because if everyone sets the sell limit orders to these memeable numbers, the HFs can see these massive clusters of sell orders and WILL buy them, which will trigger massive drops in share price, and in turn likely cause panic selling much like we saw during the short ladder attack on Thursday. So what next?    I DONT FUCKING KNOW CAUSE I AM NOT OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE, ONLY KNOWLEDGE AS UNDERSTOOD BY ME    But here's the thing: these particular HFs have turned the market into a game, and a very select few badasses noticed this early on, and then started playing. After much due diligence by the thousands of redditors on this sub, more and more people learned the rules, saw an opportunity, and bought shares of GameStop because they like the stock. These HFs are now counting on all of us retail investors, especially those who are playing on hard mode and don't understand the market, to cut and run and give them an out.       TL;DR      These particular hedge funds have turned the market into a game. They used cheat codes all last week, and are literally banking on newer retail investors who are playing on hard mode to lose and give them an easy out. Educate yourself as much as possible on the rules and make your own personal informed decision on if you want to set sell limit orders and what that number should be.   Again, this is not financial advice and I truly am a dummy. I've just been lucky enough to use my nephew's iPad to educate myself whenever he gets distracted, which is usually only during lunch time because Patrick loves tendies. And finally:        STRAP THE FUCK IN AND PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF

Why an SLV squeeze will 100% not work.
First of all, let's talk gamestop: it's a very simple centralized market. buy or sell shares of the company. So far so good.  The problem with SLV is that silver IS NOT A CENTRALIZED MARKET!  The biggest silver market is COMEX, which is a futures market. See, futures markets aren't the same thing as single stock markets, they are much bigger, have more institutions rather than retail investors and they are much more complicated.  When a typical retard buys gme, they hit buy market and that's it, they now have 1 share.   In futures, it's different. You buy contracts, these contracts are standardized and the most popular contract for silver is : SI . SI has a contract size of 5000 troy ounces!! One contract is equal to  135000 $ worth of silver. You don't need to pay 135k for a contract, you can buy it for 14k if you close the position before you need to take delivery of the silver.  Some of you might have 14k, but the risk is very high: if silver moves down 1 dollar you lose 5k.  Another problem in the silver market are the participants: goverments own silver, hedge funds own silver, investment funds own silver, too many people own too much silver!! Gamestop is at about 30 billion dollars marketcap ( and that's now ).   The open interest on the latest SI contract is 135 960, giving it an open interest value (which admitedly is not marketcap) of   usd. 18 billion usd in just open interest.   Open interest is how many positions are open at any given time.  Silver is a much bigger market, with more big players.  GME - there weren't so many hedge funds (poor Melvin, that was the one big hedge fund shorting gme) and so it was a subreddit against a fund, and we won.  Silver is a different story - JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, hedge funds, governments, a lot more money is in silver than gme.  For these reasons, don't go into SLV, you will just play where the big boys want you to play, they have the advantage there.  tl;dr : Silver won't moon, banks have advantage, hold gme to 10k.
Prepared for Departure
Please check my crayon math: HF holding outstanding $GME short shares are paying $15MM in interest per day.
\~50,000,000 outstanding short shares. (current assumption, please correct my crayon scratches)   \~30% interest rate on holding those shares.     50,000,000 \[shares\] \    \[interest rate\] \  $320 \[closing price of stock\] / 365 \[days in a year\] =  $14,728,767.   This honestly doesn't sound like 'a ton of pressure to sell' when they are standing to loose billions... Or am I missing something in my calc?        Again, I have started eating my blue crayon as it tastes like gasoline smells.  All future adjustments will be made with red crayon.
PSA FOR ROBINHOOD USERS: Take daily screenshots of account balance and holding for the forseeable future
Robinhood has recently been restricting withdrawals on people's accounts. There have been a number of posts lately regarding this, and on Friday I also fell victim to Robinhood locking up my cash and preventing me withdrawing to my bank.  I highly recommend everyone to take daily screenshots of their account until you have transferred to a different brokerage or closed all positions and cashed out.  I would also highly recommend doing this on a computer if possible, so that you can make sure all relevant information, including the name on the account, every stock/option you are currently holding, the total account value, and the date/time are all visible within a single image.  This may be the only way to protect yourself in the case that RH faces a liquidity crisis and takes all of your hard earned tendies. RH is insured up to $500,000, with up to $250,000 being cash.  Also, $GME to the moon, diamond hands, and all that other jazz  EDIT: Because I just realized this, I also recommending downloading a statement, and overlaying it over the RH portfolio on your browser, so that you can also capture the account number and name. 2-factor authentication will go a long way if you end up filing an insurance claim when RH goes bankrupt.  EDIT 2: Many are suggesting screen recording apps for active trading during market hours. I will 100% be using such software and I stand by these posters and suggest everyone else uses these screen capture applications. I have seen AZ Screen Recorder recommended. If anyone has other suggestions, post a comment and I will add them to the list.  EDIT 3: I REALLY LIKE THE STOCK

Canadian Autist here. My polished smooth brain don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but I know
Listen to me: We CANNOT trust the short interest numbers this week.
First, credit to u/johnnydaggers for putting the pieces together in  .  Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce "WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!"  There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.  # This is probably a lie.  Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way,  way  more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.  There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here:    If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.  If you   do   know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.    TL: DR  \-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can "unwind" their  disclosed  short positions, without ever having to exit their  real  short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell,   up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.    So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.  My GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.  I originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed   I'm holding until $10,000.   I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.     EDIT:   if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment      EDIT 2:   people are pointing out that that source I‚Äôm using says short squeezes aren‚Äôt really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.  Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.  The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.  Hold. The. Line.    EDIT 3:     6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume? I don't fucking THINK so. And even if they are, that doesn't unwind the 2-3x as many shorts built on top of imaginary shares.    EDIT 4:   to quote  , "Fuck the stats. Watch the fear."

WSB and Gamestop are changing the financial world
I‚Äôve been trying to soak up everything thats happened this last week, as it all seemed to happen so fast. I think I may have averaged about 3 hours of sleep per night, digging around the internet/twitter, following new developments, and trying my best to recognize what is actually happening here.  Millennials and relevant generations were set up for failure from the very beginning. Not only did the DotCom bubble hurt the parents of young millennials, also affecting them, but the ‚Äò08 crash totally wiped out pensions and retirement accounts, sending most all the way back to square one.  During the ‚Äò08 crash, many billionaires (who were already in the 1%) were made while the average person suffered. Since then, media coverage, guidance, and other forms of communication were heavily pushed out to the average investor to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù them get back on track, while hedge funds and deep money in Wall Street were really commanding the ship.  What I‚Äôve noticed these past few weeks is a rebellion from those suppressed (common man/woman) in the form of heavy concentration on a few securities. GME, BB, NOK, AMC and others are all we   focused on while the rest of the market was ignored.   Futures didn‚Äôt mean shit on Friday, as GME closed ~135 points higher than it did Thursday. While this happened, shorts doubled down on the other meme stocks while limit buying ability was forced on a few brokerages. Cowardly illegal attack. However, what I saw was the mass waking up and ignoring the media, technical patterns, futures, and others means of manipulation used by Wall Street to create an emotional response within the common man. We are no longer paying attention to the tools Wall Street uses to drive the ship. In fact, us ignoring those manipulative ‚Äúindicators‚Äù only makes our autistic power even stronger.   This week, I am giving you homework. Your homework is to continue to COMPLETELY ignore the media, futures, social media posts, etc. Who the fuck cares if futures are down 10,000 points? That indicator only matters if you‚Äôre a üìÑü§öpig and sell your positions. We do not invest with emotion or paper hands anymore. WE decide what the stocks are worth and WE have each other‚Äôs backs, unlike the government who has handed out pennies to us on our taxed dollars.  Stick to your plan and hold with   . If someone else sells, i‚Äôll still be holding for the next person to jump in and have a chance for battle. See all of you   on the
Brokerage Transfer process
Moving my brokerage account into another account. I initiated the transfer this Friday and usually customer service for the brokerages will be closed, so I would get an answer until at least Monday, which may be to late.   So I woul like someone input in who knows the process of the transfer. I'm moving from M1 Finance to WeBull. I am transferring GME stocks. I did not liquidate the account just doing a stock transfer. So I'm curious on the process and how they are executed. I'm assuming I bought a stock and have a digital certificate to that stock. So what common sense would tell is that they will just transfer the electronic stock certificate via wire. I know there will be $75 charge on the senders end. Now will I lose that stock? Or is a pretty safe bet it'll be smooth transfer? Thanks for your help, Im sure some people are interested in this as well. If this was discussed in a previous thread please. Thanks for all your help. Glad everyone is sticking together and having one common goal here. To the moon
The Big Long: explained
Since WSB grew millions overnight, I see a lot of questions regarding GME, I'll try to answer those here.     1. What's happening with GME?    The GME play is a very simple problem of supply and demand. Without having to explain what shorting is, just know that as long as short interest is over 100% the following applies:  - There are 100 sellers of GME - There are 200 buyers of GME  We (retail/shareholders) represent 100 of the buyers above, the other 100 buyers represent hedge funds. The difference being that we already bought, hedge funds are still on the hook.   Now, because of this, hedge funds want to buy for as low a price as possible and every day that they don't, they are paying Billions in interest. This tips the tables in our favour since we don't have to pay any interest for not selling.   In a nutshell, if we don't sell, the price of GME can, theoriticaly, go to infinity.    2. How can you participate?    All you need to do is buy $GME with YOUR cash. On Thursday we saw what happens if you buy shares with the enemy's money (margin), they short attack to push the price lower and sell your shares via a margin call. If you have a reputable broker you can also disable lending of your shares to further limit the supply.    3. What stage are we in?    If you've seen The Big Short, we are in the stage where everyone realises the system is corrupt and the banks are scrambling to find a way to profit and not go bankrupt.  In this movie you are the ones betting that the housing market will go down and the hedge funds are the banks. The brokers (which disallowed buying of GME) are the rating agencies.     4. Is it safe to make this bet?    In a non-corrupt free market buying GME while short interest is over 100% is a free money glitch. You're basically betting against corruption at this point in time.  History has shown corruption is   so do not bet more than you're willing to lose. Think of it as a donation against corruption that might get you a lot of money if you win.    5. Is this what wallstreetbets is about?    No, WSB is about taking risks and treating the market as a casino via the purchasing of derivatives (option contracts) in speculative plays. This is the first time in WSB history that buying shares is being advocated.    6. Is this financial advice?    No, I just really like the stock.    Disclaimer:        üåï
See you on the battlefield tomorrow.
GME - Technicals, Why the Suits are Scared, Speculative PT's
Alright Degens, It's time to look at some CRAYONS  Let's talk about the theory behind using magic lines; Momentum in stocks can be somewhat predictable, and 'Elliot Wave Theory' depicts just that (Figuring out what a reasonable Price target to set and how long these rallies can push for is more complex and we wont talk about it.)   Follow along as you look below: Stonks go, "Up, dip, up, dip, up" before going "dump, bump, dump."   ![img](1ddqqikagpe61 "Think of these depicted trends as - Swingable trades / Multi-week / Long term.          (When we are looking at GME charts below, imagine the charts are Starting right after the 'support' was found at the number '13' on the Long term trendline.)")     How do we relate this to GME? Bullishly, I would say we are about to enter the last 'impulse wave' (Top trend line in the picture above,) and that price movement on Monday/Tuesday this week will say a lot about how drastically this squeeze will truly be pushed upwards. (Rising wedge depicted below)              Now, I'm not in love with the wave cycle above  and that we appear to be on relative to the Long term stages of this movement to be completely honest, and after including the PM/AH price movements... It appears that on Thursday morning GME had started the first move in it's final impulse wave higher to find the peak; Meaning, the  squeeze was very likely to be squoze  going into into Thursday's Open Market had retail not been almost totally restricted from buying.   (See chart Below; (5) would've been 'peak' - perhaps around 1k/share.)     Finally, a bit of AMC analysis.... Here we see a similar story to GME, appearing to be within a rising wedge, ready to start its next impulse wave upwards. 3-6 mo PT of $28     TLDR?   \- Monke's that are FOMO'ing GME, watch the price-action of PM.    \-Monke's almost exposed a financial meltdown on Thursday, good shit  \-AMC is a buy at $13
I like the stock. (So does Spartacus.)
Never thought I'd like Monday. But now I wish Monday come a little sooner. Debt free for mom, me and my fianc√©. Visiting my dad. GME to the moon!
A bit late to the game but I‚Äôm gain is a gain and I‚Äôm not leaving!
Trying to Short Squeeze Silver is a Bad Idea
First, let's jump into and talk directly about the zeitgeist.  Yes, it is heavily manipulated. Yes, there is a shortage. Yes, there is a case for the inflation adjusted price being disconnected from current market value.   Yes, it has industrial use. Yes, it's the metal on your wife's bf's cock ring.     You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.  It's a   Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.  Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?  Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.  Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)  Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX & LBMA.  JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.  I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.  These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.     That said, the existing DD has had very very valid points.  Silver is logically a sound investment, especially after QE Eleventy Billion.  I'm saying bleach your mind of the thought of attempting to impact the silver market.     Relevant positions: A few hundred ounces of physical silver. And if ya'll trying to mess with this, I'm going long on $ROPE
I'm just an ape that likes bananas "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"
aside from Gamestonk issuing more shares, don't these shares now essentially represent the value OF THE PEOPLE HOLDING THEM (PLUS) the Gamestonk company ?  So you think your personal value is sell out at 69420/share ?  Why not just hold your share ?  "But how high can it go ???"  I duno look at   it's like 350k/share...     If the hedge fund needs to borrow any of my share to close out their short position, I can contact my attorney on retainer for negotiation.  I'd let them borrow a share for... $1mil/year for rest of my life  Then they can get out of their short position. and stop bleeding.  "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"  Right now I think they are trying to find a cure for the situation they are in...
We're not the bad guys. Bad guys are the ones who would crash the market rather than taking the loss. Their plan.
Here's what they might do this week. Notice how Goldman Sachs are saying that GME might crash the market? They are going to do it and scare us into selling GME. At the same time   blaming us for the crash to get public support for more government regulations against us!    I'm a pretty smart ape and that's what I would do.  Notice how GME has been going against SPY lately? It might reverse to tank all together this week when they sell their long positions and short GME at the same time. But have no fear fellow apes. Just hold onto that bananananana and GME will eventually come back up.  In shorting even more they are incurring a much higher interest day after day.  I would just ignore the market this week and do something fun to relax until you hear about the squeeze has squoeze.
Possible GME Capital Raise Scenarios. I think Rights/Warrants Distribution Most Likely.
TLDR: Gamestop (the company) has not done anything since the stock surged - they've said nothing. The board's objective is to make this a long-term win. It is not to either pump the price or burn the shorts. Burning the shorts is fun for them, but not their job. A significant cash infusion via capital raise (around $1 billion or so) would increase their positive outcomes a lot. There are a few ways to do this, but I think the best is a rights dividend/warrant offering where current shareholders get warrants. This would have some unpredictable effects on the stock and possibly cause some unpredictable short-term volatility, but would ultimately reduce volatility a lot..     Disclaimer: Not financial/investing/tax advice. I'm not a sell-side expert and don't have investment banking experience, but if any sell-side experts give me commentary on this thread I'll integrate and credit. I probably got some details wrong. I'm short-term bullish on this stock, but have a tiny long-term put position.   Gamestop as a business would long-term benefit from more cash right now. They have 949m of long-term debt, and a bunch of leases they'd like to cancel (and severance payments they'd have to make with those store closures to laid off employees specific to those stores). They also would like to accelerate their development of more profitable businesses (such as eCommerce, any new ideas, and the rest). Extinguishing this debt completely, ditching bad stores, and investing in growth would all make sense to an extent, even if they turn around and issue new debt (at a much lower interest rate since their financial situation will be improved).  To do this, they need to raise capital. While they could use debt, I don't think that makes sense with equity at these values. Therefore, they will try equity if they do. The three approaches that make some sense (Also the three most frequent approaches) are to do a secondary offering (similar to an IPO, which is a primary offering), do an off-the-shelf offering (which they technically can already do $100m of), or do a rights distribution.  Additionally, GME will want to regain control of their stock. Tilray's founder commented on this recently, but basically, when the stock is like this, there are a lot of side effects  - more legal risks, any options or RSUs you issue employees stop being long-term motivating, a lot of early retirements as people cash out their options, and just a huge amount of press that is unrelated to your business goals. It's not actually good for the business to have a stock this volatile.     Here is some more detail of my non-professional understanding of these fundraising methods. I think a rights distribution is most likely.    Secondary Listing:    This would involve them bundling a bunch of institutions and offering new shares out, just like an IPO. The problem is that to do this, they have to offer at a discount. This will enrage current shareholders. This also will allow shorts to cover more or less immediately, which also will enrage the current shareholders. I think this one is bad press all around, and I think they'd have to offer a very large discount to get institutions comfortable with doing it given the daily volatility. They also open themselves up to lawsuits, because the price is very volatile, and if GME is, for example at $100 3 weeks from now, it's an instant lawsuit. by both current and new shareholders because the losses are so large. I think this is their worst option.    Off The Shelf Listing:    GME already has a $100m authorization for this. I suspect (but don't know) they already used it I believe there are some timing issues here, but this is the second best option. I think there are some timing delays on being able to use it, and there may still be some legal risks I'm unaware of. Optically, I think it looks not great because it will run contrary to the fervor gripping the stock right now and be seen as giving the shorts a bit of a lifeline.    Public Rights Distribution:    A write-up on this in general here:     I think this is their best option. In this, they would dividend out warrants to shareholders (this is an option, except you pay the company for the share and they make a new share, instead of someone having to sell you an existing share - so it dilutes. Usually this is done as 1 warrant per X shares. So for example, they might dividend out 1 warrant for every 5 shares held. They could then set a warrant exercise price that is low compared to the current price, but obviously not lawsuit bait, such as $20. Dividending out two warrants per 3 shares long at this price would likely result in full conversion right now, and raise them $1,000,000,000 roughly in cash.  Because these ONLY go to existing shareholders, it ends up not being dilutive in the same way other offerings are - everyone can preserve their share if they put capital in - does not punish longs.   Realistically though, they'll want to issue the fewest warrants possible at the highest price they can justify and avoid danger because the more warrants they issue, the more it increases the value of puts and can create unintended consequences.    The way this would play out is that they'd first announce the rights distribution, probably a few days to a week before. This will result in some interesting market dynamics that I'll describe in a moment.  Then, you'd get the rights distribution as a GME long. As a GME short, you'd have to SERVE UP THE RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION to the long you borrowed shares from.  Because there are a lot more longs than shares, this would have some chaos, which the market makers would have to sort out.  Then, there would be a short time during which people have to elect to exercise the warrant, which you'd be able to do through your broker They'll want this as short as possible so that the price doesn't fall below the warrant price.  Then, they clear all the warrants, and a day or two later, deliver all the shares to people.  This is their best approach I think because it gets them capital without being pain to existing longs, while also reducing their lawsuit risk compared to the others because they are just distributing a right at a low price to existing longs on equal footing, who are the ones who have standing to sue them in the first place.  I don't know how the laws would work on insiders - I think they can exercise these, but I'm sure there are a lot of details on the timing of it. They probably need to do it well ahead of q4 earnings lockup to be clean.    Rights Market Dynamics:    I find this very hard to predict, but this would have a few effects.  1. Upon the warrants/rights being granted (NOT declared), stock will fall in price significantly, but longs shouldn't actually lose money because they also were granted warrants. In theory, warrant value + stock value for a given number of shares (plus their granted warrants) should be the same as the prior stock price. In other words, I don't really see it as bearish or bullish. 2. You would not want to be long call options through this. Very ITM calls and calls that expire before the distribution would be largely and completely unaffected respectively, but OTM longer dated calls would get destroyed the moment this is announced. If you do have an ITM call, you will want to get out of it before the distribution by either exercising to get shares, or selling it. If you sell and are still bullish, you can then go and buy shares. Would not recommend trying to buy OTM calls after this repricing, though I guess you could. 3. Puts are the reverse. Puts that are shorter dated than the distribution don't change. Puts that are longer dated go up in price a lot even though the total value of the company didn't change. 4. You could be short through this, but it's a little annoying. Most likely, you'll be marked short the warrant, so the warrant share structure will kind of mirror the current long structure, but this has to be closed out before the exercise date, so warrants will all get called in at some point.   In a sense, it's forcing shorts to cover a good portion of their short   since the warrant will arbitrage such that the warrants granted + stocks originally held = same value as the stock alone was before. They'd have to get the cash to buy warrants on the market to deliver to people you borrowed from. Likely a bit of a mess. Would cause some short covering, alongside that call selling. Would this be more buying or selling? I don't know, the stock is super levered. I don't think it would matter a lot initially though. 5. After the distribution happens, the stock should reduce volatility after the initial price renormalization of warrants distributed + original stock = same market cap (but stock price down). This will be more the case after shares delivered. The reason the volatility reduces is that this will reduce the leverage in the stock - calls on one side, short on the other. It also eliminates the bankruptcy thesis that shorts were in on in the first place. 6. GME would regain control of their stock and be set up for a faster turn-around.  The only downside of this is it's a bit less intuitive and will require significant explaining to people. But I think it's the most fair to existing shareholders, causes the least legal risk, and puts the company in an excellent position to do their turn-around.  What I'm uncertain on is if there are weird gamma squeeze dynamics from the share price being implied to be lower after a distribution. They may want to distribute more modestly than I'm suggesting for this reason.    Other Unknowns:    I don't know what restrictions are on how many warrants they can toss out and if shareholder votes are required. It seems to me it's close to a stock split, so maybe none? Any investment bankers have thoughts on this - minimum price they can offer a warrant if equal distribution to all shareholders? Maximum dilution? In situations where they have to issue warrants at or above current price, this obviously would not work at all. My sense is they can be at a discount, and can dilute, but may have maximums. Anyone able to confirm who is an expert?    Timing    My understanding which may be incorrect is they can‚Äôt do this before earnings. Their fiscal year I think ends this week? So they‚Äôd have to hurry to do this. Would not be surprised at an early earnings in order to facilitate. Early earnings is a tell that capital raise incoming.

Apes Together Strong
Reminder to anyone who is newly trading stock on your cellphone: make sure your mobile security is on point. Tips inside.
2FA for everything, strong, unique passwords, make sure right now that you're set up to find your phone by GPS as well as the "scream." Make sure you can remotely wipe your phone. Don't put your investment apps on the home page. Have those apps time out quickly. Criminals know that a bunch of new people are now throwing extra money into their phone. I have had a few close calls throughout the years, most of them within the past year as these assholes are getting smarter and bolder.  Edit: I'm hearing a lot of people suggesting a VPN, password manager, making sure your phone is totally updated, and also not using sms for the 2FA.  I have also heard "GME 1,000      I'M NOT SELLING."
Media influencing stock decisions?
I was just watching fox news and the analyst blatantly called retail investors ‚Äúthe gum on wall street‚Äôs shoes.‚Äù Why is the media trying to give more power back to Hedge Funds? Sure, retail investors aren‚Äôt as rich as hedge funds, but collectively they can be very important to the economy. The analyst also called what WSB is doing ‚Äúillegal‚Äù...without really saying why.  The media, especially CNBC, does not get it. Why does watching the news feel like being on Mars? It‚Äôs like they want hedge funds to rule the world and continue their abusive practices, and that‚Äôs not fair, either.  I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but talking about your stock picks and even explaining why they‚Äôre a good choice is not illegal.   The media clearly feels threatened by a subreddit, which I think is freaking awesome. Let them panic and try to influence the   like they are paranoid that WSB is doing.

The last motivational post you'll need for your diamond hands ü§ù
Alright my monkeybrained buddies.  Tendietime, memes,  emojisü§ù , whatever motivation you think you still need for tomorrow and the days after to just HOLD,   its actually much simpler.    So mute your evening drawing class for a minute, chew your crayons to help you concentrate and focus on what im telling you.  We know:    A) Shorts       by holding short positions. Shorts desperately want to close positions.      B) To close, they have to buy stonks from us;    saw a post earlier (help me find it?) saying we hold most of the shares.     C) If they buy, price goes up because we dictate the ask.    so by easy, 2 braincell logic, whoever sells first, will automatically be the first to miss out on the tendies that follow.  Now idk about you guys, but my 3 braincells seem to only exist to make me think about what i missed out on,  >"why didnt i buy earlier", "why didnt i buy more", "why did i not take out a fucking loan".  Im more okay with holding too long than too short  (fuck short anyways right?)  The essence is: what will you tell your 3 friends when they ask how much you made?  >"yea nah i sold at 600 haha, i know it went to 5000 but you know that old boomer who said you cant time the market haha? now lets go celebrate at wendys i'll let you guys choose anything you want from the dollar menu haha"  Dont be that guy  Now go back drooling at your art teachers cutout, delete your limit orders and when your artificial mistress Alexa wakes you up tomorrow with the generic "I love you my lovely toilet-tiger" and your old notification to sell on market open, tell her shes not real and ask if she allows you to stay in bed for 10 more minutes  TL;DR:  As soon as you sell, it drives the price up further because shorts have to cover and buy at our ask, therefore the sooner you sell, the more potential gains you will miss out on.   ü§ùDiamond Hands win,   r fuk     Edit: Im retarded, the    is todays top-post, get my pills someone
I went full retard and bought 15 kilograms of silver. I just like that it's so shiny.
Schwab DD - The company who stands to gain the most out of the restriction/collusion fiasco - $SCHW
Charles Schwab/TD Ameritrade and Fidelity/Vanguard   were the only large brokerages that did not lock out its users and allow massive market manipulation by Citadel.  $SCHW owns and operates both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab and has the most to gain from this Citadel/market manipulation fiasco.    Breakdown of Restrictions by Brokerage: Worst to Best      RobinHood: (Worst)    \- Trading restrictions limiting purchasing power to as little as 1-5 shares on over 50 stocks     \- Allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of GME and AMC during Thursday's trading rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)  \- Liquidity issues: RH is racing to raise 1$ billion from its existing investors as of Friday as many individuals are withdrawing their funds in protest of restrictions  \-Raised margin requirements on many securities  \-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities    Interactive Brokers (garbage)    \- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)  \- CEO stated in CNBC interview they imposed restrictions to help out hedge funds (and stabilize the market)  \-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities  \-Raised margin requirements on many securities       WeBull + ETrade (garbage)    \- Trading restrictions on GME/AMC/BB allowing closing out of positions but banning purchasing of these securities during Thursdays trading Rally. (coercion with Citdael/Melvin to tank price)  \-Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities  \-Raised margin requirements on many securities    Schwab/TD Ameritrade (reasonable)    \- Banning naked call option sales on GME and volatile securities  \- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)  \- Raised margin requirements on many securities  \- Allowed trading of volatile securities once cash deposits were verified (many new accounts experienced this issue as new funds were not settled)  Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses    Fidelity/Vanguard (Best)    \- Raised margin requirements on many securities  \- Limiting short selling on volatile tickers (limiting trades with unlimited risk)  Both of these restrictions are reasonable as they have unlimited risk and are not trying to be liable for any substantial losses  Thousands of upset retail investors will be fleeing RH, IBRK, Webull and Etrade over the next couple of weeks. Switching to Fidelity and Schwab/TD Ameritrade.  I would also go long Fidelity investments but it is not publicly traded.    Schwab Analysis      User Growth:    The amount of brand new retail investors opening up accounts over the past week is ridiculous. GME + AMC + BB pump has been blasted across every media station. Every online brokerage was experience server lag and strain over the past week due to the increased volume from new retail investors. Traffic on these sites were 3-4 times what they normally were during the recent trading frenzy.     RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK transfers - many retail investors will be transferring over their accounts as a result of the trade restrictions and collusion with hedge funds. Listed below are the total accounts at each brokerage  RH: 13 million accounts  Etrade:   million accounts  Webull: 2 million accounts  IBRK: 700k accounts  Even if only a small portion of users switch brokerages 5-10% we are still looking at 1-2 million new accounts up for grabs between TD/Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard  More users = more deposits/commission = more profits = stonks go up    Reputation -   RH/Webull/Etrade/IBRK have had their app ratings and reputation destroyed thanks to reviewing bombing as a result of market collusion. These low reviews will discourage any new retail investors from using their platforms and push them towards TD/Schwab/Fidelity.   .    Discount:    $SCHW is trading at a 17% discount (as of PM on Friday) from its January high all while new retail investors and user registrations and deposits reached an all time high over the past week. Negative media coverage and market sell off this week has caused every publicly traded brokerage company to sell of from their highs. With a market rebound and new user registration data for January this stock will fly past its ATH's and run into the 70's.    Average Daily Users    The average daily website users has seen almost a 20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had   million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.          Upcoming Earnings    $SCHW is going to crush their upcoming earnings for Q1 2021 in April. They acquired TD Ameritrade on October 6. The amount of new retail investors has exploded over the last couple of months. Just look at last years growth in new accounts most brokerages have seen a over 100% increase in 2020 traffic. Their next earnings report for Q1 2021 will be the first quarter with 3 full months of combined revenue from both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab. There will also be a mass exodus of upset traders fleeing Webull, Etrade and Robinhood by the thousands and transferring their assets into TD Ameritrade and Schwab.    Future/Longevity of Brokerages:    TD Ameritrade/Schwab will be one of the few brokerages not being slammed by class action lawsuits as a result of the manipulation today. E Trade, RobinHood, IBRK and Webull will have users fleeing in the masses to new brokerages. Do you really want to leave your money sitting on a brokerages that may have pending lawsuits against it and possible liquidity issues? (looking at you Robinhood)    Price Target:   Bank of America just upgraded $SCHW on January 12 giving it a $68 target. Stating their has been mass growth in retail users. This was prior to the new user explosion the past 2 weeks. This stock will easily run to $70 once data comes out for January 2021 on the amount of new users and transfers.    TLDR:   $SCHW will crush its Q1 2021 earnings thanks to an explosion in new retail investors as a result of the media coverage on GME and AMC. Retail traders on platforms that halted trading activity on Thursday will also be transferring their holdings to Schwab + TD Ameritrade. $SCHW is at a discount thanks to the market sell off and will rebound to $70+ once registration data comes out for January.  Position: 02/05/2021 & 02/12/2021 $57 Calls  Calls are dirt cheap as this stock is seen as a boomer stock with low volatility.  EDIT: A few people saying TD/Schw/Fidelity were no allowing GME/BB/AMC trading. This may be a result of your cash not settling. New accounts needed their funds to settle before trading these higher volatility tickers. Any errors popping up may also be due to server strain, I was using TD and RBC in Canada and had issues finding tickers/entering into positions  EDIT 2: Schwab will be giving its winter business update on Tuesday at 11am. I expect them to discuss the massive growth in retail investors which should help this stock bounce.  EDIT 3: talked to a online agent about transferring over investments into Schwab. He mentioned that there has been more transfer requests in the last couple days then all of last quarter causing wait times/rep times to go from 5 minutes on hold to over a hour on average.

GME Dirty Tactics by Shorts    ->    ü§≤
Learn about the tactics that have been and will be used on GME  Prime brokers, hedge funds, broker dealers, and the DTC are all in bed together with the help of their friends in media   CNBC, WSJ etc.   These financial institutions allowed illegal short sales of counterfeit shares and they‚Äôre about to receive a reckoning the likes of which have never been seen before.   Beware of dirty tactics such as short ladder attacks, media assaults, and pulling margin away from long customers etc. in the coming weeks. For example, a short ladder attack is where they‚Äôll tank the share price using counterfeit shares so the price you see is fake and not reflective of supply and demand, which will induce panic causing you to sell or so they hope. Similar to what we saw on Jan 28 when it moved from 450+ to 112. They want you to sell them your shares cheaply so they can get a free pass and unwind the mess they‚Äôve created. Don‚Äôt fall for it. They would never give you a free pass so what reason do you have to give them one?   They will have to buy your shares to cover their shorts so just   ü§≤.   This level of short squeeze is unprecedented  . I don‚Äôt know how long it will take but it will happen. If you can, call your broker and request your shares not to be lent out.   And if you haven‚Äôt seen this yet I highly recommend you watch this video where Cramer talks about how he manipulated the markets in 2006. At the time, the video was made for the internet and it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt supposed to go out to tv‚Äù. Little did he know the internet would become bigger than tv.   Look up Cramer and Aaron task interview manipulation on YouTube  Automod won‚Äôt let me post links                    Not financial advice .  I just like the stock  Edit- Don‚Äôt be distracted by the comments talking about other stocks. GME is the only one for me because I truly believe in this company.
BANG (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) Donation Megathread
I looked through a lot of donation posts and it seems like not everyone is getting the recognition they deserve. To those who are giving back to the community, your actions are not going unnoticed! If there are any I left out, post them in the comments!  The media needs to realize that we're not a mob, we're not a collective hedge fund, we are regular people who realize that hoarding the money for themselves isn't the best way to go about things.                                                                           To everyone who donated, thank you for doing so! To those who still have BANG stocks, don't forget to hold
What is selling?   don‚Äôt know what sell mean.
Thank you GME for not announcing any stock sale - YET!
Reading   Excerpt from the Bloomberg article follows.  =================================  Happily, GameStop does have an ATM offering going. It put it in place on Dec. 8, 2020, when the stock was at about $  The way these things work is that GameStop disclosed that its bank could sell stock‚Äîup to $100 million worth‚Äî‚Äúfrom time to time‚Äù at GameStop‚Äôs request ‚Äúconsistent with its normal trading and sales practices‚Äù; it did not disclose any particular schedule, and has not yet reported if any shares have been sold, or how many, or when. So I don‚Äôt know if GameStop had sold the whole $100 million before Friday‚Äôs wild run, or if it had any stock left over to sell; if it had any left over, I don‚Äôt know if it sold it all on Friday. I hope it did!
"Citadel buys order flow from Robinhood", but what does this mean?
I'm looking to try and write up in a factual and not oversimplified way what this actually means, and the implications.  (More or less an ELI25, not an ELI5)  Would it be factually accurate to say then that retail traders sending a buy or sell order to Robinhood are having their buy and sell fulfilled by inventory held or dispensed by Citadel?    And if so, then how is Citadel's pricing reconciled with other exchanges?  How is volume reported?    What is Citadel's exact mechanism for profit on each such trade?

Timeline explaining what happened to your options on Friday
Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, I am not a professional. In fact, I am quite dumb. Right now 97% of my portfolio is in GME, the rest is PLTR leaps. All that follows is fan-fiction and speculation   To understand what happened Friday you need to understand some things in the context of their timeline    Tuesday     Regular Trading Hours   options are still cheap. On Tuesday the price first broke over $100. You could buy 1/29 200c for $200 each (various times throughout the week those could have been sold for over $25k). the call volume was \ insane\ . so hopefully whoever sold those calls has the shares to cover them, right? Well, it turns out, most of the contracts were sold by  Market Makers (MM)  they literally make the market possible by providing the necessary liquidity to conduct trades. When MMs sell you options, they don't buy all the shares they need to fulfill that order. But if the option goes in the money, then they'd better have those 100 shares, because someone will be exercising it.   Afterhours   Price shoots up so all the options are in the money. \ oops\   options up to 320 strike are added    Wednesday     European Market   the price is getting really high      Regular Trading Hours   Watching the order flow is like watching a battle take place. They have algorithms that are being used to try to push the price down, and things rapidly get bought back up. It's like watching someone try to keep a beachball underwater. The hedgies call their news buddies at CNBC, they make us out to be an alt-right white supremist group (fuck that, we don't talk about politics!) they call us irresponsible, they try to scare the retail investor and then make everyone think a selloff is happening so a sell-off does occur.  Well what they don't understand is they've been fucking training these   DIAMOND HANDS   since before October and November. The paper hands have already sold to us, you're not going to find paper hands by employing the same tactics you've been using all along. But I guess you're all out of options..  Anyway, they can't get the price below the highest strikes of $320, which is really bad for them.   Afterhours   Price maintains at high levels above highest strike of 320. new strikes added up to 590 ( ? unclear on exact strike here and too lazy to look it up )     EDIT the highest strike here seems like it should be $450. (thanks u/LBGW_experiment) I don't know where I pulled $590 from, like I said - fan-fiction. And I am a huge fan of this stock      Thursday     European Market   the price is getting really high    You can bet the hedgies are watching it as closely as I am. Touching $450 there, crossing $500. it's low volume trading, but a strong indication of really positive sentiment. Well this is the day everything happened. And it makes sense, the hedgies REALLLLLLLY needed shares to cover all those calls that were in the money now.   Regular Trading Hours   How to do it, they think. So they twist everyone's arm and eventually figure they can scare off the retail investor by   BREAKING THE FREE MARKET  , allowing users to sell but not buy. C'mon...  The price is shooting up any way. The gamma squeeze of a century looks to be occurring, and it will trigger the short squeeze. Time to scare the retailer! BOOM circuit breaker after circuit breaker, people are rushing to outsell each other, and the bid is lowering to maintain a safely wide bid ask spread.   Very few shares are being exchanged  , but the price drops from about $450 to $125 in a span of about 35 mins. hedgies are selling short to each other and then selling the same shorts again a little lower to artificially drive the price down.  The plunge ultimately doesn't work to scare us, again bc    ü§≤ , but I suspect they were able to stop loss raid and people couldn't buy back in..  Overall, things are harder on Thursday, and we finish lower than Wed close.   Afterhours   I haven't gotten much sleep at this point, and I didn't watch AH very closely, so no comments here. Strikes up to 800 were added.    Friday     European Market   continued buying and strong price support. very strong sentiment.   Regular Trading Hours   So this is where the hedgies are really sweating. They've gone back to trying to keep the beachball below water and nothing is working. "How did this not scare of the stupid peasant?" they think to themselves and ask one another.  The last thing to consider, is that the MMs also made a lot of money on OTM options that expired Friday. They could use this to cover some of the losses from the options they sold earlier that 100x, BUT ONLY if they they were able to sell some options that expired OTM.  For this to happen is was   monumentally important   for them to defend the $350 price. I watched algorithmic precision carry out on the sell orders - it didn't look like there was much human selling (unless you are systematically opening up orders to drive the price down with low volume).  So now they've defended $350 hard all day, and they want to scoop up more profit from calls they sold at lower strikes. Thus begins a brilliant 2 hour long decline of carefully driving the price down. In my estimation, they are having a really hard time borrowing shares, and after that little stunt down to $125 on Thursday, they have to carefully allocate shares.  Well 11:00 comes around, and they realize that they're dangerously low on ammunition, so they get RH to buy back the contract from you   an hour before they normally would   an hour later many of those calls were worth 5x what you got, not to mention RH does a shitty fill. so you were fighting blatant and coordinated price manipulation and a shitty fill price.  And that's what happened to your options on Friday.  TLDR edit:    üèª ü•≥ these hedgies are trying to scare you, but they can't figure out how.

I'M ALL ABOUT ROBINHOOD CANCEL CULTURE
This sub just bailed out two multi billion dollar companies on its own. Think about that. AMC secured $300,000,  in new liquidity from the recent Reddit fallout, American Airline received $  Billion.
This sub appears to have saved two companies from possible bankruptcy over the last week.  It‚Äôs important to realize that when you purchase a stock, the money you pay does not go to the company, it goes to the previous owner of that share. By buying stock you‚Äôre owning a (often) tiny piece of that company from someone else, unless the company itself did a direct stock offering their own.   If you want to inject cash into a company the best way to do this is bonds which are basically loans, but this is WSB and no one is interested in a low risk return of 4% over half a decade.  AMC and AA were able to take advantage of the insane stock surge to offer new stocks, with which they received a cash injection of 300M and   over the last week respectively.  From Bloomberg News:   ‚ÄúAmerican Airlines revealed plans on Friday to sell as much as $  billion of stock through what is known as an at-the-market program, which allows companies to issue additional shares at market prices. The announcement came after their stock was up as much as 38% at its peak last week.    Just a couple days earlier, AMC said it had raised more than $300 million through a similar program. Investment firm Silver Lake, one of the company‚Äôs main creditors, also seized on AMC‚Äôs surge to convert $600 million of bonds into equity, before selling the shares in the open market for a gain of over $100 million.‚Äù   That‚Äôs insane, obviously there‚Äôs others buying shares but it started on Reddit, the momentum, hype, initial rallies..... led to the bailout of two multi billion dollar companies facing the very real risk of bankruptcy. Redditors probably just saved AMC and AA which is mind blowing to realize.

The train is leaving the station.
This is it guys. GME will be squeezed very soon and everyone has the potential to make more money then they ever dreamed they would see in the short course of a few months to two years. The stock has reached an extremely comfortable price for us to receive every profit of the short squeeze.  Even if everyone who has joined the GME train for a quick buck in the past few weeks pulls out next week, businesses and the huge mass of people who have the common sense to hold have already created a foundation for the squeeze to happen regardless.  This stock will be hitting $5000 by next Friday and there will be many that miss out. Those who pull out are going to be on the sidelines and, just like every other stock they had a hunch on, are going to just watch the gain percentage keep jumping. All the while, that pit in their stomach will keep growing as their despair reaches new heights.  By Monday, the stock will be leaving the station.  \-This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor, but I'm telling you to make a judgement call.
If it makes any of you paper handed fucks feel better, many hedge funds are holding too. DO NOT SELL
If you're scared that Wall St is too powerful and they're going to wipe us out tomorrow, keep in mind it's not actually 100% coordinated against us. Not all firms are shorting, there are many Wall St players who are actually playing the upside here and helping fuel the rocket.   proves that they're confident the squeeze hasn't squoze and these suits are   just like us.   TL;DR for the chromosome-deficient: MUCH OF WALL STREET LIKES THE STOCK TOO

What reason do we have to believe the shorts didn't cover?
First off, let me say I like the stock. I bought in at 18 and held. And I really want someone to answer this with the part of their brain that thinks, not the part that memes. That said... So I know the short interest is high, but what reason do we have to believe all the old shorts didn't already cover, like on those days where we had almost 200 mil volume and the price went to the moon? How do we know this isn't a bunch of new shorts, purchases at these ridiculously elevated prices with little motivation to sell urgently? People are acting like hedge funds live in a vacuum and can only sit and watch their money fade away despite whats going on being clear as day. I am honestly concerned the squeeze is being over played at this point, and it is mostly hype driving the stock. The shady shit that has been happening, as immoral as it is, HAS actually happen. Lets say they didn't go out and just flat out lie to the world and really DID close out those horrific shorts.  I'm not trying to rain on the parade, but I feel like this shit has hit a tipping point where devil's advocates get downvoted for not being a diamond hand apes and people are being blasted with this social justice narrative and just hype pushing the price up (or on friday, just holding flat).  Can someone make a good case why this isn't true and we are still in the same spot we started?  EDIT: I am not trying to shit on GME, I've been riding with you all since 18 bucks. These retarded ass replies are exactly what I am saying, sure its fun to say stupid ass shit, but its still stupid ass shit. We didn't get to this point but posting emojis, we got here looking at the numbers, liked what we saw, and acted (well one person did, and everyone else just followed i guess) . If we can't allow people to entertain other angles to the situation, you're literally becoming the shitheads we usually hate
WITH OVER 7 MILLION SUBS WHO ALL LOVE THIS STOCK WSB COULD OWN THE ENTIRE GME FLOAT WITH AN AVERAGE OF 6 SHARES! Please read and share if you love this stock
Yes that is right. There is a float of   million shares, as of writing this we have   million subs. If the average WSB sub owned 6 shares we would own the entire float of the stock. The shorts can squirm as much as they want but the only way out would be to buy back at the price that the share holders are willing to sell for. It was reported that OVER HALF of robinhood users had shares of GME last week, that is   million users with shares. We are getting very close to cornering the market, I think that may have contributed to the shenanigans at the end of the week. Prepare for more incoming this week, but if we hold the shares we hold the power. Power to the players. If you think owning only a few shares doesn't make a difference it does! 6 shares each and we own the whole thing. I love this stock I love you guys. Please share this if you also love this stock.  Edit: 156 shares, bought some at 13, 18, 42 and $250.  Also forgot the    üêí    EDIT 2: Hey thank you all for the awards! Now I gotta figure out what they do!

THE BUYING PRESSURE ON GAMESTOP WILL ACCELERATE THIS WEEK HERE IS WHY $GME
Look in the mirror. See how retarded you are?? Everyone else is also just as retarded if not more. Most opinions you read and news you hear and rumors about anything are wrong, and genuinely dumb or ill thought out. I too may very well be retarded.   Most of the takes on Robinhood are wrong. It‚Äôs a traffic jam. The same guard rails that are supposed to protect the plumbing of the system in an off   on the left side of the chart are slowing the system in the on   on the right side of the chart. You just can't open up millions of margin accounts a day trading stocks that move 300% a day. Even the most liquid brokerage quickly becomes very illiquid holding all the liable accounts. By Tuesday they will have enough liquidity and shares will have settled and retail will be able to buy en masse. Robinhood is the #1 app in the WORLD right now. This is only going to accelerate. They will get the plumbing right and add lines of credit. Credit markets are fine, so Robinhood can access capital. To the moon        In addition, all the folks transferring accounts OUT of Robinhood cannot sell. It can take 3-5 days for a journal to clear. That is forced   , which reduces the tradeable float of GameStop, increasing the short interest as a percentage of the float.   We will see more buying pressure this week, forced holding by transfers, more institutional buying, and algorithms from quant funds like Renaissance Technologies analyzing everyone‚Äôs autistic thoughts, and following!!  IM AN INTERNET RETARD DONT TAKE MY ADVICE  TLDR: I really think the stock and think the squeeze continues and accelerates this week $GME
The WallStreetBets Charitable Trust
I saw the post the other day about donating Switches to Children‚Äôs Hospital and it got me to think. We degenerate autist are a special breed. I think we have a chance to do something. I think we should create a Charitable Trust. We could weaponize our autistry for the good of mankind. This idea is literally half baked but maybe we could run some paper trading contest, and take some of the top players, along with some experienced philanthropist (or is it philanderist?) to form the board of our organization. We could fund it with small donations, and multiply the effect by having our top autist invest the money (having proven themselves in our paper trading contest). We could start with u/DeepFuckingValue as a founding member of the board (I hear he wants to build an indoor track for his community as a start). I would love to establish ourselves and then take on boomer Jim Cramer‚Äôs charitable trust in a trading contest, with the proceeds going to the charity of the winner‚Äôs choice. All of this is just an idea, we‚Äôd have to hire an attorney (or maybe one of you autist is an attorney) to begin to form something like this and get the taxes and organization established. Or is this idea just as retarded as my portfolio? Obligatory       ‚òÄÔ∏è              Edit: Thanks for the comments. Two barriers have been raised: 1. Admin cost, though I can‚Äôt imagine they would be very much with folks volunteering but I have near zero experience. 2. Any organization and the SEC might decide we‚Äôre more than a group of people who just REALLY LIKE THE STONK  Are they insurmountable? I have no idea  Still I think the discussion is worth having.  In the meanwhile I‚Äôll figure out something local. Regardless                Edit 2: Thanks for the awards, my first, but buy stonk!

Fractional Shares
Another Robinhood Shitvention, in addition to operating on billion dollar transactions with razor thin fault margins.   Question: if every buys 1 share of a hypothetical company, let‚Äôs say $GME, the brokerages have different techniques to actually buy it. They could hold it for you, put it directly in your account, take your order and give you an IOU, all kinds. But it‚Äôs still 1 share. And you, the guy with smol leverage, are essentially the one holding it.   But if everyone had 20 bucks left over, why wouldn‚Äôt you use it on fractional shares of $GME. They are fractional to you but to the brokerages they probably have to hold the full/whole share to divide amongst the public. They are absolutely just held by the brokerage or some sub-holding company. So effectively you are forcing the brokerage to also HOLD GME, as it would be difficult for them to offload the shares if they are ‚Äòshares‚Äô by 30 different monkeys.
Mental Health: Learn from past trades but do not anguish over them.
I want to first congratulate all those with the gains to the moon and who got in early. As we got past the moon and headed to Mars there will be many of you who got off the rocket early.   Do not fret as there will be other opportunities out there.  My history of paper handed GME fuck trades.  1. Bought 3500 at 17, sold at 25 2. Bought 2500 at 30, sold at 42; 3. Bought 10 x 75 Calls for 10, sold at 35 4. Bought 1000 at 86, sold at 110 5. Bought 700 at 38, sold 5 x 60   away last week  6. Still holding 200 at 38 cost...  I‚Äôm still up 100K but looking back I could be a 8 figure gain. It has been eating me up even with my cancelled 750 x Feb 35 C at .60 as I just sit there and do the math on that one.  In the end there will be more trades, be smart, clear your head, and remember you are on the right side of the ground today.   TLDR: Gains are Gains,Holding my GME, and putting 100K in tomorrow
I ain‚Äôt selling. GME $30k/share is not a meme
Supporting the cause from Asia. GME gonna give me tendies for my first house. Not selling till 1000+
Can we please ban/remove screenshots form RobinHood? WSB has undoubtedly contributed to their popularity!
If we allow users to continue posting their RH screenshots, we are complicate with helping to contribute to RH's popularity. If those screenshots cannot be shared here, it will help force users to other less manipulative platforms. We're at   million members now, this could help force them out of business further, because let's be honest, people are going to forget about their crimes and go back to using them.   Go use Fidelity (what I use) or Vanguard! Maybe the influx of all of us idiots demanding a shiny usable mobile UI will help them get a move on that as well!

Monkeys need a LOBBY! Hedgies only spending 5M!
To all my fellow Diamond Handed Autists:   According to   Hedge Funds spent a  mere  $5,610,000 in 2020 on Lobbying in TOTAL across all hedgies. We all know Chamath said " r/wallstreetbets is now the largest hedge fund in the world. Excepts it's completely decentralized and entirely democratic". I eat crayons so what do I know, but if Melvin is down 70B for  Not liking the Stonk  then   have lots of       . If Apes take just a fraction of bananas instead of spending it on billboards & meme-worthy flyovers, they send fancy men in suits to protect pristine rainforest from the bad men with chain-saws (Robbin' The Hood and other soulless boomers responsible for 08')   This is not financial advice - I was dropped on the head as a child and I really like the stock!
Some non-GME broad market DD
Listen up. I just got off a conference call with all your wives' boyfriends and I got some DD to drop on you. Everyone here knows about the big four stocks right now. If not, GTFO.  What I‚Äôm here to tell is to not focus 100% on these four and let other great opportunities pass you by. (Note ‚Äì What I am NOT TELLING YOU is to sell your GME. Hodor that sh\ t). While you all have been foaming at he mouth over your GME games, you‚Äôve likely missed what is going on with the rest of the market. Several great performing stocks have been dumping since this GME craze began. Oh, need examples?  To name a few you may have heard of:   AAPL ‚Äì Down     AMD ‚Äì Down     BIDU ‚Äì Down 7%  DOCU ‚Äì Down    F ‚Äì Down    PINS ‚Äì Down    NIO - down 8%  Wondering why this may be? Two theories They both might be right, or I might have a really smooth brain.   1) These hedge funds everyone here is so keen on financially ruining need to cover their losses somehow. What better way than to liquidate stocks that have had crazy runs the last few months.  If this is true it will be extra enjoyable to watch them pay more to re-enter these positions when the stocks inevitably bounce back.  2) You people selling your shares in other stuff to buy more GME. (again, great job holding the line) I have seen several posts on here from other smooth brains selling their shares of some of those listed here. I applaud your enthusiasm for the cause and wish you the best.   With these two combined, you end up with tons of shares dumping from these 401K stocks, with the buyers foaming at the mouth for more GME, NOK, AMC, BB.   Once this is all over and the world of normies forget all about the GME madness, they are going to put their money back into their boomer stocks and standard 401K stocks. What does this mean for you? Don‚Äôt miss the dips happening all around you while the world is focused on 4 stocks and a shiba inu. If you have any extra money and cant afford GME, check out the rest of the market for buying opportunities.   TLDR ‚Äì Keep holding the line! If you have any money left, buy the dips on others for bonus tendies  (This is not financial advice)  Edit - added NIO.

GME PAYS DIVIDENDS ! HOLD GME NO MATTER WHAT ! IF YOU PANIC SELL THEN YOU LOOSE ! IF YOU HOLD GET PAID DIVIDENs EVEN IF GME GOES DOWN! WHICH IT WONT IF WE HOLD! WIN WIN AS LONG AS YOU DONT SELL!
Serious question without the memes please: What are all the possible outcomes to all of this?
I could care less about Melvin, Citron or Citadel and they can all eat shit.  My question is for the rest of the investors, the vast majority of folks who just buy mutual funds, ETFs and Indices? This is not a sanctimonious question or a "Will someone think about the boomers" question.  What is the actual market short term and long term outcomes for folks not participating in this? As there are hedge funds getting ravaged behind the barn, there are plenty of other funds that are making a shit ton of money, buying in with their discretionary in the last few days.  There are two guys in WSB that I know who work for Canada based funds that are laughing. Ex-colleagues in fact. Yes, it's an uprising but it'll also be other already very rich people getting richer.  I'm an active trader myself and will post positions at the end.  Retired 45 years old, former derivatives trader with enough in my account.  I went 1/3 cash on Thursday and will go 1/3 cash on Monday.  The rest will ride this out.  Accounts spread across 4 brokers. I honestly have no idea what's going to happen.  I can confirm with better than random certainty that in addition to GME, A LOT of other tickers are in the same position.  Teachers pension funds in Canada have fully liquidated some of their gains to free up cash. This isn't ending soon.   What are the outcomes for the broad market?  Disclaimer: I'm retarded and could be lying.  Don't listen to me. Do what you want based on your own risk tolerances.  Options (calls and puts): PLTR, TSLA, BNGO, SPCE, KTOS, IRDM, FLIR, NIO  LONG STOCK/ETF: All the ARKS, SPCE, PLTR, IRDM, XSD, ICLN, QQQ, MARA, RIOT, AMC, NOK, GME, BB, AI  Other than the ARKs, all individual stocks/calls are flipped daily.

Opinion: Stop Hedge Funds trading with synthetic money (leverage and margin), make them trade with REAL money
I just wrote this and received ~20 comments within 2 mins. Why was it removed? Posting again:  I‚Äôm tired of having to fight against synthetic money. An x $billion hedge fund really has 100x more at their disposal because they use synthetic money based on margin and leveraged trading. Eventually gains and losses are realized but not until the small people are on the losing side and the hedge fund is in the green.  If we could end their margin and leverage advantage that would make it so much more fair and less prone to manipulation.
I know that we LOVE $AMC and $GME, but why can't we HATE a stock. I might have an AMAZING short opportunity.
FULL DISCLAIMER  I am a fucking retard so my math is probably wrong, but if its not it proves that $DB is MASSIVELY overvalued and presents an enormous short opportunity for retail investors like ourselves. Also, it just happens to screw over one of the most evil and corrupt banks in the United States, if not the world. (They also have more than 300B in Debt)  Overshadowed by the recent infinite money glitch known as $GME and $AMC, $DB experienced THREE gigantic scandals in one week.  1.   2.   3.    Now that we are aware of the fraudulent and scammy work conducted by these assholes, lets analyze their share price.    Current Share Price:        Historical (12 Month) Earnings Per Share:   \  (  Q3 2020)    Annual Sales:        Annual Dividend per Share:        Historical Price/Earnings (Median):        Book Value Per Share:      (   I used two of the formulas presented in the above article Benjamin Graham & P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)  1. Projected Price using Benjamin Graham Formula  1a. SQR ((15)(  =   (actual value per share)  2. P/E Ratio (Intrinsic Value)  2a. ((  =   (intrinsic value)     This means the actual  value  of the stock is  Drumroll Please...   Between  $  - $      If my math is correct (and it probably isn't), then this means that Deutsche Bank's stock is MASSIVELY overvalued and is due for a market correction (hence the AMAZING shorting opportunity). Also, if I am wrong please correct me - I only would like to learn more about the market, so I can eventually lose $5,000,000 in an earnings call.        Current Price =       I do not want to mess up the momentum of $GME or $AMC, I am only posting this because in the same way that we LIKE those stocks, I think we should also be open to DISLIKING some of the worst stocks on the market. Especially stocks with ties to CNBC and the other hedge fund assholes who have enslaved us with debt.     \ Full Disclosure: I do not have access to margin with my brokerage therefore limiting my ability to make this trade. I also lack the capital to do so. This post is not intended to be financial advice, rather an analysis of current market conditions.\      My Sources:  1.   2.   3.   4. I used the information provided by my brokerage (Charles Schwab)     TLDR:  Assholes at big bank fucked over world economy, and now these shitheads have too much debt.   My positions are:  Ten shares of $AMC @ an avg price of    40 shares of some crappy penny stock (Frontier Comm.) @ $   Two shares of NOK purchased @ $
Won‚Äôt holding $GME to $1000 make the hedge funds not able to cover and declare insolvency?
At $1000 stock price GME will be worth $75 billion. I don‚Äôt know how many hedge funds are short GME but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a few guys with major positions and a bunch of smaller guys. So when the big guys eventually have to cover a +100x loss then arithmetically they‚Äôll be bust if the position was even 1% of their portfolios. If the funds go bust it will mean that they cannot cover and the wsb won‚Äôt be able to sell unless the price crashes (which it will eventually have to)?

The Supermassive Black Hole Event, the Death of WallStreet, and Subsequent Rebirth of FreeStreet
Disclaimer: The words together below form the prophesies of a heretic, and are meant to shine light in  the darkness. They are not my words alone, but the words of all. Thus, these words do not constitute financial or investment advise.      In the Beginning    In the beginning, the markets were created. They existed in relative balance and beauty, providing a means for investors to participate in the steering of the present towards a better future. This happened organically through investment choices. The markets were a tool that aided investors in fulfilling the measure of their being created, by allowing them to create their own world.  This balance and beauty began to crumble in time, as various individuals and groups of individuals  conspired to persuade and even control the decisions of investors. Over time, they would be successful through the deployment of unquestioned measurement metrics for value, and countless media  .   And here and now, we stand.       The Supermassive Black Hole    The markets stand on the precipice of deconstruction. Like all things in existence, and much like the universe itself, nothing lasts in any single state. Deconstruction and reconstruction happen at every given moment, sometimes in small cycles, and sometimes... in revolutionary ones.  We are on the cusp of a moment unseen by any other generation before us. The markets begin their journey to a singular, previously invisible, stock. This is happening at an increased rate, and ALL parties feel its influence.   Individual investors, traders, and gamblers are pouring money in by the droves. Larger institutions are doing the same. Even hedge funds, some of whom have doubled or even tripled down on their positions, add to the mass of this one security.   News outlets continue to cover the story. Even the news that is hypothesized to go against this event, heads towards it and increases the power of its vacuum. This very post does the same, even without my mentioning the name of the security.       The Death of WallStreet    The Supermassive Black Hole Event ends how all things end: deconstruction (death). This could happen slowly, or it could happen very abruptly. Many will attempt to escape it, but nothing can. This event cannot be stopped. It can only be delayed or change form.   Eventually, when the mass becomes too great, hedge funds will be obliged via margin calls to liquidate their assets (their clients' assets), in order to repay their loans to the institutions from which their moneys were acquired. Not all clients, though, as some could theoretically be protected by moving their positions to select safety securities.  This is likely to cause a market downtrend, and eventually a crash. Again, this could happen slowly, very quickly, or at any pace in between.  SEC will no-doubt intervene. The US government will also do so. We will also see brokers intervene in an attempt to slow what is happening. These efforts will all contribute to the event.   Though the person who gets out first mitigates the greatest potential loss, you'll find no admonishment in this prophesy to do so. The hedge funds and big money will attempt to do so, and are in the process of doing so.  This is the light that is shined before you, to show you who lurks in the corners and seeks to rob you of freedom through calculated steps to keep you in poverty!       The Birth of FreeStreet    And lastly, I bring glad tidings. This event will happen, regardless of any efforts. In the end, there will be a rebirth of the markets, more free, balanced, and beautiful than ever before. Wealth will be redistributed to some degree, but that was never the point here. And most importantly, a we will see the dawn of a new age. An age where people democratically elect the future of their own time, and the legacy they leave behind.  May the irons with which ye are laden be struck from yer wrists. God love ye.   -Happy Heretical I AM

THE WOLF HIMSELF TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT WE ARE ON TV
An open letter to David Faber of CNBC
David Faber is potentially the most well respected financial journalist in the world. He has a show on CNBC every weekday morning. He is well educated, level-headed, and very well informed. He also has contacts to every single large market player in the world.  &nbsp;  Dear David,  On Thursday morning there was a level of market manipulation that occurred on an unprecedented scale. Many people are blaming the brokers for refusing to take buy side orders on a large number of securities. The brokers have pointed the finger at the clearing house firms for increasing the collateral required for a trade from 1-3% to 100%. The clearinghouse firms are saying it was the DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) that raised collateral requirements. The DTCC has not said anything publicly; however, they have leaked it was their lenders who raised rates suddenly on them forcing these changes. The banks in question are the money center banks such as   Morgan.  &nbsp;    Counter party risk in the system    The banks did this because of counter party risk in the system. In layman's terms, they did not believe the hedge funds had the capital to pay the bill as prices rose rapidly. David this is your time to shine. Bring on the banks, DTCC, and others involved to explain this to everyone. Wall Street is at risk of turning two entire generations against them because of the actions last week. Every millennial believes the market is rigged against them now, and rightfully so might I add.  &nbsp;    Loss of capital    The big story that is not getting attention in all of this is the options market. Retail investors had bought so many options in these underlying securities that firms were being forced to buy as they went higher and higher. This is a gamma squeeze, and it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many of the securities that were not Gamestop, the options bought by retail investors expired worthless or worth a fraction of what they would have been worth. The focus is all on Gamestop, but there were many other forces at work here. Had these stocks kept going up there would have been options worth 100-500x what they were bought for. This had potential to be a far bigger story than just Gamestop going to a high valuation. This has to be brought into the light and thoroughly investigated.   &nbsp;    Yelling fire in a crowded theater    There are many who don't think this was that manipulated. Let me pose this question to you. What if the S&P 500 was up 5% for the week, and you walk in on Thursday morning only to be told you can only sell the $SPY, and   NOT  buy it. How far do you think we would go down that day? I believe unequivocally we would hit limit down in the first 10 minutes. The panic and fear many retail investors would have as they suddenly were afraid they were going to lose their money would cause many sells. This is what happened on Thursday to a large number of securities.  &nbsp;    Final Notes    I have seen many on your network be very dismissive on this whole Gamestop "movement". Guests were angry, dismissive, and frankly rude to these dumb millennial traders putting money in Gamestop. This has to change if you want the next generation to join the market like yours has, and the one before them.
Never relent. They have tried 'tactical retreat' in the past, expect they will try the same. I just like the stock
Good Hedges Vs Bad Hedges.
Hello insanely large number of new people,  This is a small piece so you should be able to kick your brain into overdrive and read around 25 percent of the words.  I wanted to let anyone unaware know that there will be sections of Wall Street also profiting off of this GME event. It's okay, nothing wrong that. In fact, you very much need them.  Please, do not be disillusioned into thinking retail buying power alone is enough to sustain the GME craze. You need Whales(billionaires on your side) and you need good Hedge Funds. For instance, Black Rock owns 14 percent of GME and is making a killing.   This might make you angry if your mission is to destroy Wall Street. That was never the intended goal from the beginning. The goal was to hit short positions where it hurts for their shitty and sorry tactics of profiting from the bankruptcy of companies. Who cares if hedge funds make money from companies prospering and growing? That's kind of the point of the stock market and the same reason you should invest.  I thought it important to raise awareness that retail investors are HURTING(in a good way) specific funds, and helping others. Such is life.  This shit will be crazy if it squeezes, don't get caught holding the bag.  I'm all in GME  TL;DR               GME 600 EoD Monday
What happens if big institutions can't pay/rebuy?
Dear my regards,  I have a noob question about the markets and our situation with GME. Imagine all of us regards won't sell our stonks below 69420$. Something very high. Small Melvin will not be able to put up this huge amount of cash, not even if the lender liquidates all their assets. What happens in that case? What happens if the price increases further and further and shorts aren't able to close their position? At some point, somewhere, some rules are going to get broken, right? Because this is a situation that should not happen and somehow can not happen. So what is going to happen to retail? Will the lender make some kind of deal with Melvin? Usually if you can't pay your debt, you will default into bankruptcy. And what is going to happen when shorts go bankrupt? Who is going to buy back the shorted positions? I assume it's no one, rules will be broken and the small retail trader without any lobby will pay the mess.   To be honest, I don't have much knowledge about the finance industry, so this was going around my head - maybe someone with greater knowledge could tell me what is going to happen next?  Please don't get me wrong and downvote me - I am trying to understand the chances and risks of this play and also the greater picture. Because usually the big capital wins and not the retail pleb. As you can already see, rules are changed mid game because it simply "can't" happen that the big ones fail and retail wins. It is not intended to work like this, the system. So maybe I am completely missing something - can you discuss with me and help me understand?  Have a nice evening my regards and lets fckng HOLD the next week. Let them bleed.
they have more than doubled down. End game is boomer talk! its just begun!!!
Why can't $GME issue more stock to help shorts cover while also profiting themselves?
This occurred to me today, why couldn't $GME issue more stock to raise capital while also also helping shorts cover? So I did a little research and found  . It seems that there is an exception for funds as long as the funds are separate. But would that prevent the hedge funds from closing their positions?          Anyways, I'm in for $20,000 @ 275. This isn't financial advice, I just love the stock.
No tinfoil hat required - Robinhood couldn't afford to let you buy GME
Does hurting Melvin benefit Citadel? ‚Äî 29% of GameStop trading volume Mon - Thurs was handled by Citadel. ‚ÄúThis is the market that Ken Griffin and Citadel Securities have been waiting for.‚Äù
Trying to better understand the end game...     >‚ÄúThis is the market that Ken Griffin and Citadel Securities have been waiting for.‚Äù  Citadel   after their massive loss from shorting GME.   So.... it‚Äôs like rich boy Melvin was stealing the lunch money of his classmate GME, and now the WSB classmates band together to fend off Melvin every day with slingshots. But they have to go to Melvin‚Äôs dad‚Äôs shop after school every day to get more ammo for their slingshots, because he owns the only slingshot store in town. No matter what the WSBers do, Melvin or his dad gets richer.   What is the end game? It seems the hedge funds benefit no matter what?  Disclosure: I own $GME.

Going to GameStop as a kid with my uncle is one of the best memories I have today.  (We were really poor and went to dream about owning games). Now that I‚Äôm an adult, I‚Äôm making memories with MY nephew (14 years old) by taking him shopping at GameStop. I own shares and gave him one share to do as he pleases. I also told him that each share is currently north of $300. Dude thanked me and wanted me to hold until he reads up on the situation. I‚Äôm so proud of the fact that dude wanted to do his own research before deciding on what to do.  Teach your kids. They‚Äôre listening. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. Yes, I own  GME interest <200shares - 1 share.

Hello Mr. Cohen,  With the amount of attention the current situation we all find ourselves in has gotten, I would bet you may check in on this forum if only for a laugh.

We have really given the company new life in the past few weeks and I think it would be great for you to chat with us a bit.  Many thanks  Cock knuckle.
Why wouldn‚Äôt Melvin cover...
Why wouldn‚Äôt Melvin and company cover when they (allegedly) manipulated the stock to dip to 126... why wouldn‚Äôt they buy massively itm call options with a .99+ delta to exercise for 100 shares a pop and massively otm call options to make back their losses as the stock popped when their (alleged) manipulation wore off?  It seems like a no-fucking-brainer. If they manipulated they knew it would spring back... it would have cost them essentially pennies to buy 300 strike call options for that week. They could have stood next to the MM while he made them, using the MM as a middle man waiting for retail to buy them for a premium to get clapped. Hell, they could have rode puts down to 126 too... there‚Äôs only a few options:  1) they didn‚Äôt manipulate and have no idea what‚Äôs going on so they didn‚Äôt want to double down in any direction.  2) they did manipulate and are dumb as fuck about where that would bring the price.   3) they did manipulate and they did cover with options and are prepping to clap retail  -edit- I‚Äôm marking sus as fuck account age posts that spout gibberish within the first few minutes of my post. We have some serious bot play here.  -edit2- I got added as a confirmed poster to the most controversial posts on Reddit subreddit... lul.

NVAX Part II: Outlook Beyond the Fortnight
I tried to   you all a week ago what was coming. I had my first 6 figure day in the market on Friday when NVAX went from 134 to 235 overnight after reporting great efficacy data. My weeklies were up 9000%, it was incredible. I want to send a thank you to u/Upstairs_Speech for his posts in the past, I would not have thought of the trade if it was not for him.  Now before you all tell me "I wish I saw this before the stock went up 70%" let me explain to you why this is still early innings. Sure, this might not be as sexy of a trade as round 1 was, but now that data concerns are off the table this thesis has a lot less risk. This one is more of a low risk, high growth play as opposed to a get rich quick one.  Let's do a mental exercise:  The day is December 31, 2020, everyone is excited to be moving on to 2021. NVAX share price hovers at $110, a $7B market cap awaiting UK phase 3 efficacy data. There are real concerns as to whether NVAX actually has a vaccine that works given their prior 30 years of failures. The market prices this risk accordingly and NVAX's market cap is only   17%   that of MRNA.  Fast forward 4 weeks. NVAX has released data on 20,000 patients, shows the highest efficacy of any vaccine against wild type COVID. NVAX shows strong efficacy against UK strain which no one else has. They show that the South Africa strain is a real concern with efficacy at 60%, and there is 0 reason to believe any vaccine will perform better against that strain.   And I can't overstate this part enough, the   really   important detail here is that NVAX is the only protein vaccine on the horizon. The only other protein vaccine coming any time soon is MAYBE GSK/Sanofi and they already showed terrible data. They blamed it on dosing but there are major question marks there and they are delayed 6 months minimum. The reason protein vaccines are important is because they are the only ones that can offer coverage against multiple strains in a single shot. This is how the flu shot is done (which NVAX just passed phase 3 of in March). The flu shot is a protein vaccine that covers 4 strains in a single shot. What is becoming very clear is that we are going to need the same for COVID. The future of COVID vaccines is that in your annual shot you get coverage against wild type, SA strain and Brazil strain for example. NVAX is the   only   company that can do this right now. RNA vaccines are too reactive to handle multiple strains. You can already see how many symptoms people get with the current vaccine.  This   is gold and helped me to understand the situation.  The market clearly has not digested this sufficiently yet. How do I know? Let's go back to the exercise from the beginning. Given NVAX's advancements in the last 4 weeks their market cap has doubled, up to 14B. What do you think Moderna has done in that same time frame when their COVID platform continues to weaken? Up 5%? 10%? 20%? They are up 67% in that same time frame! After everything that has happened NVAX still only has   20%   the market cap of MRNA. It basically hasn't even caught up. The reporting from mainstream media on NVAX was an abomination, especially compared to how they covered J&J's bad data. The truth will emerge. The market will realize it and will see NVAX is still deeply undervalued.  I am obviously not saying that NVAX will inevitably be as valuable or more valuable than MRNA. MRNA technology is very valuable and they are an extremely ambitious company. BUT, NVAX is about to play catch up due to the glaring discrepancy. In addition to COVID don't forget that NVAX has an incredible flu shot, likely at some point to be the first RSV vaccine ever and their Matrix M adjuvant is now very valuable. Quick recap of differences between the two vaccines:     My belief is that NVAX gets to a 20B market cap very soon (50% upside) and I can't imagine a world in which its not at 30B minimum by year end (100% upside). Upcoming catalysts are finalizing 200M dose deal with EU, emergency use authorization in the UK and other countries will quickly follow, production partnership with Merck or GSK/Sanofi and others.  IMO this week will be very telling, if it is up on Monday buy and don't think twice. If it pulls back maybe give it a couple days to get a better price on options as it might consolidate for a while.    Positions:    75% allocated to 1/21/22 280 calls. If it gets to 30B market cap by expiration its over a 300% return and I think market cap gets there by end of summer so it would be even more profitable. Don't mess with the July calls at this point, they are too expensive. You basically get the same value and more time going with next January. IMO this one is free money.  25% allocated to 4/16/21 240 calls. If it gets to 20B market cap by expiration this is a 150% return. I think there is a somewhat decent chance it could be there by the end of this week but we will see.

$BANG (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) Options Volume Analysis
Due to the exponential increase in membership in WSB I have started to see a lot of misinformation, favoritism, and overall divisiveness going on within the community. I decided to do my own Due Diligence (DD) to determine which stocks I will be holding next week, and hopefully this can start up a meaningful conversation in the comment section to help out our new friends who mostly want to know what to invest in.  I pulled the top 15 stocks with the greatest Options Volume from Friday (1/29). You can see all 4 of the $BANG stocks make this list. Despite understanding that GME is a heavily shorted stock with a Short Float greater than 100%, it is important to look at the Put Volume as well. This is the numbers of option contracts that are shorting the stock. GameStop is the only company of the batch that has a Short Float of greater than 100%, which is why this short squeeze is working so well, but it‚Äôs also the most heavily shorted on the options side. I think it‚Äôs important to see all 4 of the BANG stocks are heavily shorted on the put side too. If you look up who is buying these Put Contracts, it is mostly big institutional investors, whose best interest is to artificially depress the stock price so their puts pay out (look at what happened to BB and NOK on Thursday and Friday). This is why we have to stand together as a community and embrace the $BANG index that we created.    GME   \- This is a short squeeze. Not much to say here. Buy, hold, don‚Äôt sell.    BB   \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. 66% of the float (shares available) are owned by institutional investors, so while the float might seem big (550M), we are only dealing with 34% of the shares. Buy, hold, don‚Äôt sell.    AMC   \- Also a short squeeze. The Short float isn‚Äôt above 100% but this is still a great potential candidate.    NOK   \- This is a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze. This is the weirdest one to me because everyone was claiming this was ‚Äúbot‚Äù propaganda last week and then has the 3rd highest option volume on Friday. Not sure how to feel about this one, but hey its popular.    Defining some terms:      Short Float:   Percentage of shorted shares in relation to the total number of floated shares (shares available to be traded)    Options Volume:   Total number of   option   contracts bought and sold for the day    % Put:   Percentage of total option contracts that are puts (think the stock will go down)    % Call:   Percentage of total option contracts that are calls (think the stock will go up)    Put/Call Ratio:   Ratio of puts to calls option contracts (higher the ratio, higher the short %)    FAQ:    \-Where did I get this chart from?    \-Which Stocks do I own? I own all 4 $BANG stocks  \-Which options should I buy? Buy shares  \-This is just my personal opinion and not professional investment advice

What are the greatest memes in the history of WSB?
I loved reading the post yesterday that listed the craziest trades from the history of WSB (Control the Narrative, 1RONYMAN, Analfarmer2 (was there really an analfarmer1?, woodc93).  My personal favorite was the guy trying to figure out how to take physical delivery of a futures contract for oil.  I think everyone would agree that WSB has THE BEST memes on the internet.  So yesterday's post left me wondering: what are the greatest memes in the history of WSB?  The best meme I have seen on WSB is u/Zachincool's "The great war between WSB and the traditional investor."  The writing is brilliant and it has aged well given the GME frenzy.   .  So what are the other hall of fame memes?

OPTIONS CHAIN UPDATE
According to the  , the upper limit of the option chain for 02/05 is set at 800$. The 320+ close certainly came in clutch here setting up good momentum for next week.  With the massive IV (Implied Volatility), keeping up a  $ limit would literally save the hedgefunds tens of billions of dollars. I sincerely recommend to adjust sell limits and prepare for take off because the bounds of the solar system may be left next week.  So therefore, I repeat:    $ is not a meme         (This is NOT financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor in any way. We are literally autists and retards who like the stock       )
Exercising OTM GME Calls Early
Someone mentioned this on another sub. Since most brokers blocked exercising 0 dte calls on Friday. Would it be possible to exercise OTM calls before they expire for someone who doesn‚Äôt care about taking a loss just in order to obtain shares?  Ex:   Retard has a 2/9 $400 call, and say by 2/8 gme isn‚Äôt above $400 (say it‚Äôs trading at $350) and there‚Äôs a possibility the call will expire worthless  retard exercises $400 call on even if gme is trading at $350, retard obtains 100 shares at a cost of $40,000 netting a $50,000 loss due to the current share price of $350.  Now this retard has forced the seller of the call to issue the 100 shares to him rather than having his call potentially expire worthless. Now this retard can hold onto the shares until the short squeeze can occur.  TLDR: Exercise the OTM calls rather than having them expire worthless if you have the cash and are willing to hold the shares. GME   (not financial advice)  I JUST LIKE THE STOCK

I don't believe retail investors will crash the market, and you shouldn't worry.
In February of 2020 a friend and I bought some SPY puts. The market tanked and we made a few thousand dollars. Awesome. Fast forward a couple weeks later and it was all gone. The main reason is because we were smooth brained idiots but the fundamental reason is because everyone (including retail investors) bought the fucking dip. Even if this GME thing somehow crashes the market, retail investors and large institutional investors alike will prop up the market.  I just want to clarify this GME rally is great. Greedy hedge fund investors got caught with their dick in the cookie jar and they look like fools and rightly so. There is a crude imbalance of wealth in the world and anything that helps put more money in the hands of the less fortunate is a good thing.    By the way if anyone has GME calls, just know the ratio of puts to calls on GME is 3:1, for you smooth brains all that means is there is a lot of bearish sentiment on the stock, so just watch your tendies.

No sell, no top. It doesn't matter what anyone else says... $GME $AMC
If we never sell, the price will go up. This isn't manipulation, it's just math. Why sell a goose that lays too many golden eggs?   AMC and GME are now historic, household names. Buffett didn't sell AAPL as shares climbed and climbed. He accumulated more every time public faith in the company wavered.   There is no price target for me. I will hold these shares until someone pries them from my cold, dead   . Asset prices will continue to climb, and there will be increasing systemic pressure to invest. When other investors see that we aren't just trying to play these stocks, but that they are icons, trophies in our war chest, they will join with us. I believe that no strategy beats buy and hold, especially when other investors believe that idea too. I won't trade this stock, I believe in what AMC represents: the rebellion against the   that will refuse to let them off easily for plundering coronavirus relief funds, causing the housing market crisis, and more.     62 shares GME, 400 shares AMC and 3 $40 02/05 calls.

This weekend will be a long one but don't let it be a cold one. We need to stick together, we are a family. We must keep the same energy we had this week into the weekend. Let it take over our bodies on Monday so we can propel AMC into a new Millenium. We, are the future we are changing the stock market we have hedge fund managers by the balls and we can't give up. We. Must. Squeeze. Harder.  We have to squeeze the shorts out of their little ballsacks. We are tougher than them and there is a fuck load more of us than them. More than 4 million people joined the sub this week, do you know the kind of power we have? Wallstreetbets IS Wallstreet. We are the captain now. This is our ship and we are not letting those little hedge fund fucks take over our money. No one fucks with wsb.  Hedge funds have 48 hours to prepare for the reckoning on Monday and they think we will be sleeping with our cocks out. Not a fucking chance. We will have our cocks out alright but in their wife's mouth. wsb has no breaks we will never stop until we are on the moon. We are planning out our new civilization on the moon and no one can stop us.  We the autists of the best community on Reddit like this stonk. Elon Musk like this stonk. The world like this stonk. Tomorrow when we take this stonk to the moon we can wave back to the normie hedge funds on earth and dump our pp poo poo on them. Lets make this section in future history books a glorious one.   See you fuckers on the moon.  tl;dr: Fuck Robinhood, AMC to the moon

Melvin Capital ends month with over $8 billion in assets after investors added cash
TLDR: Rich clients invested more money to feed the beast. Hold strong       Full Article:   BY REUTERS ‚Äî 8 MINUTES AGO By Svea Herbst-Bayliss  BOSTON (Reuters) - Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop (GME) drama,   lost 53% in January   but received commitments for fresh cash from investors in the last days of the month, a source familiar with the fund said on Sunday.  Melvin ended January with more than $8 billion in assets after having started the year with roughly $  billion in assets, the source said.  The firm, founded in 2014 by Gabe Plotkin, had bet that ailing video game retailer GameStop's (GME) stock, which traded at less than $5 five months ago, would fall. But a wave of retail investors, comparing notes on social media platform Reddit and using online trading app Robinhood, took the other side of Plotkin's trade to send the stock up 1,625% this month to close at $325 on Friday.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the loss.  Hedge funds Point72 Asset Management and Citadel gave a $  billion capital infusion to Melvin Capital earlier in the week, enabling it to close out that position with a large loss.  "The fund's portfolio liquidity is strong. Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital's inception in 2014," the source said.  As news of losses at many hedge funds spread in recent days, speculation mounted about which firms might be forced to shut their doors. Several investors and fund managers said clients have been more patient with certain firms that have a long and strong track record, likely allowing them to survive this month's deep losses.
I'm 26 and I like this stock
Open letter to the brokers, just close the short positions.
The shorts will go bankrupt and you are next in line.  This is a game of chicken where reality tips greatly in our favor.  1. It costs absolutely nothing for us longs to hold onto our positions. Guess who has to pay to hold onto their positions?  2. Shorts can only try to shake us but the more they pressure us, the more our hands get encrusted in diamonds. Shorts can keep trying tricks but we have our own whales to see through them, meaning every dip is a discount and eventually, we will shake off all paper hands.  3. This collective will attain diamond hands. It is a matter of when not if. You have people who have nothing left to lose, betting everything they have on a chance to change their lives. You have people who are here just to make a point. You have degenerate gamblers who flip the finger to risk management. You have people who are just here for entertainment. These people are willing to see their money drop to 0 and this crowd is going international.  The only way out of this situation is to unwind the short interest and better now than later. If the shorts go bankrupt, as a broker, you are on the hook. Better close those short positions while the losses are limited to the shorts. Maybe you're enjoying the interest from loaning our shares out but the goal is to bust the shorts and we don't mind you being collateral damage (especially those specific few of you, you know who you are).  Positions 50 GME @ 300  Disclosure, 150 of my previous 200 shares belonged to friends and family. I sold at 425 and re-entered at 300 using a different broker.

I do not want to detract from GME, AMC, or even BB.   I am not a BOT ‚ÄìBeep Boop 001111001   Positions or Ban:   Shares, will add along the way.  I keep seeing posts saying ‚ÄùNOK doesn‚Äôt have enough shorts to move the stock‚Äù or ‚Äúthere‚Äôs too many shares to even get it to budge‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know where all this loser mentality came from. So I‚Äôm going to try to convince you otherwise with simple DD and pretty colors (This is my first DD post‚Ä¶ever). This is better than half the shills do out there going ‚Äúhaha NOK NOK go Brrrr‚Äù  I‚Äôm a smooth brain fuck but even I can see on January 27th bulls moved the stock to $  from $  a change of over 50%. FFS, if that‚Äôs not moving the stock I don‚Äôt know what is. Does that sound like an unmovable object?        There are a couple reasons we came down from that high so quickly, retail/institutional shorts were crawling all over this thing and the next day we were RESTRICTED from buying. I think there‚Äôs a lot more shorts on this than previously anticipated. Diamond hands are needed here as well as access to the open markets owe can buy and hold.  Volume is trending upwards recently as well. With a record setting day on the 27th.     If we take a look at three charts below you can see a similar pattern. All three are great stocks. All three are down from all time highs. Except one hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúwoken‚Äù up yet.     Look, I cant do the level of DD some other people do on here and others have done a great job pointing out the positives, so I‚Äôm not going to beat a dead horse. All I know is NOK is sitting near multi-year lows (like some other famous stocks were recently), its volume is picking up immensely (like some other famous stocks recently), its based in nostalgia(just like some of the stocks that went up recently) and its getting a lot of publicity which makes my pants feel kind of tight.  It has not yet popped, not even in the slightest. Don‚Äôt just cast it out of your mind because you think its worthless. That‚Äôs the same shit people did to GME when u/deepfuckingvalue mentioned it a year ago. Now those same people are eating crow while he‚Äôs bathing in fucking tendies. Will this be the same as GME? No, GME was a special catalyst. Could NOK double or quadruple in a year? Yes, absolutely. Isn't that worth a look?

Full paragraph below.  The snakes still have the SEC to help them.  Some fund managers say the episode is likely to change how the industry works.  Fewer hedge funds are likely to highlight their bearish positions by disclosing put options, they said. Instead, funds may use Securities and Exchange Commission rules to keep confidential those positions, a tool activist investors have long used to build positions in companies quietly. More funds also may institute rules about avoiding thinly traded, heavily shorted stocks.
STOP FIGHTING OVER AMC AND GME, BOTH ARE BATTLEFRONTS VS VAMPIRES
There are   calls at 40$ for this Friday for AMC, 25000 BETWEEN  20-40$ and 32000 for 20$ and   under 20$.   You stupid apes need to stop fighting over AMC and GME and realise this is a team effort . AMC is helping GME by gathering the scared masses that are afraid to invest in GME . This will fuel GME after they get in.   Also, you brain-dead diamond hands, you have to realise that hedges will not just cover, but will fucking go long with you as well and short the fucking top.    YOU NEED TO LET GO OF THE SHARES WHEN THEY SHORT THE TOP.  We don't fucking now when is the top, but if you don't leave your shares before the top, you will give free money to hedges.     Stop fighting over AMC AND GME and realise the potential here. AMC is gathering the masses while GME is holding the front line .  Then you will have two gigantic monsters .

Melvin Capital Lost 53% in January, Hurt by GameStop and Other Bets
Juliet Chung‚Ä¢üì∑Last Updated January 31, 2021, 7:25 AM  Melvin Capital Management, the hedge fund that has borne the brunt of losses from the soaring stock prices of heavily shorted stocks recently, lost 53% in January, according to people familiar with the firm.  Melvin was founded by Gabe Plotkin, a former star portfolio manager for hedge-fund titan Steven A. Cohen. It started the year with about $  billion and now runs more than $8 billion. The current figure includes $  billion in emergency fundsCitadel LLC, its partners and Mr. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management injected into the hedge fund last Monday.  As part of the deal, they got non-controlling revenue shares in Melvin for three years. So far, Citadel, its partners and Point72 have lost money on the deal, though the precise scope of the loss was unclear Sunday.  Melvin has massively de-risked its portfolio, said a client. People familiar with the hedge fund said its leverage ratio -- the value of its assets compared with its capital from investors -- was the lowest it has been since Melvin's 2014 start. They also said the firm's position-level liquidity, or its ability to exit securities in its portfolio easily, had increased significantly.  New and existing clients have signed up to invest money into Melvin on Feb. 1, according to the people familiar. It was unclear how much they would be adding.  Melvin had established itself in recent years as one of the top hedge funds on Wall Street, but a short position in GameStop Corp. hurt the firm in recent weeks. Losses extended beyond GameStop, with declines coming from throughout its portfolio during a period of market turmoil in January. Positions in which Melvin had publicly disclosed owning put options -- bearish contracts that typically profit as stocks fall -- in its last quarterly regulatory filing soared, while positions in companies it held sold off.

GME share price moving forward after the shorts squozed
Hi all, im providing my opinion on the subject matter as i have been hearing chatter about share prices crashing back to $4 or $20 once the squoze is over.  I am of the opinion this will not happen as we need to look at companies which successfully battled Shorters as reference- best one is Tesla TSLA:  a. We all know why GME price  , due to gamma squeeze from calls, buying of stocks and shorts covering - all these led to stocks being bought from float. So less supply and more demand = price go up bigly  b. Important to remember who are the parties benefiting from   - retail, whales and institutions who long shares and calls, and GME insiders  c. The manipulative actions of brokers to limit share buying by retail - share buy limit 1 - 5 shares and increasing margin to 100%, these are actually good for holders. Why you ask? Because that means retail buyers who have 100% cash to back their holdings can hold onto these shares without worry about having stop losses or increase margin requirements.  So with these 3 points once share price rocket and settled (assuming at $1000 to 1200), there will be some selling to recognise profits. But the price will not crater because simple reason, at that price GME has the capital to reinvent their biz - means more incentive for whales and institutions to hold as a value stock. Retail will mostly likely hold.  When selling takes place it will also be controlled, because people are not selling to get out of a sinking ship, but to make a profit. Look at TSLA do you see its price cratering because holders are dumping desperately? Buyers who got in later this week bought the shares between $200 to $300 on average, there is no reason to sell at massive loss once price     Sorry for rambling im using all my powers from 2 hour sleep. Pls fuck me up if my monke üêí brain anal ysis is wrong.  This not finance advice.
My thoughts why the GME rally could possibly be over already.
Hello,  so I am not paper handing, I have bought 100 shares in November and am still holding, though, I build too much suspicion over this weekend and I would love you guys t actually counterargument my thoughts, just so that I feel better.  Here are my thoughts why GME might already be over:    don't know the real shorting numbers and the HF might have covered most of their positions already:  all the numbers that were presented on twitter & co are just guesses/were calculated by algorithms. Hedgefonds aren't dumb, they know how to outsmart these algorithms so that it looks like they are still holding their positions (this way they can short the stock again, before official numbers are published and make money). They had a lot of time to cover their positions in small quantities by now. Why would they just keep holding on their positions to cover them at the highest price? The short squeeze hasn't happened, that's for SURE. BUT: maybe it won't happen anymore, because they are prepared, because they covered most of their positions in the last week in smaller quantities (because they weren't ever forced to do it all at once, the price simply wasn't high enough, that was the case in the VW squeeze).  We have seen that the hedge funds have learned, for example, there was no gamma squeeze, they covered their positions early enough, not like the week before.    much attention  don't get me wrong, attention is great, but maybe this whole thing is already done, because we had too much attention. Even porn stars have tweeted about gme by now, and I know out of experience that this often means a change of trend in a stock.    lot of instability, just small bad news are a possible catalyst for a free fall  there is nothing that protects us from a free fall, and this would definitely mean the end for this story.     Guys, i am totally retarded and I KNOW I will get a shit ton of downvotes for that, I just want a couple of good arguments that prevent me from paper handing and maybe it will help other people as well.
This is what covering their ass looks like. Closing long positions to cover GME loss. The effects of 140% naked shorting NOT WSB.
PSA: IBKR removed the restrictions for GME, BB, AMC options
Just like the tittle says, IBKR removed the trading restrictions for GME, BB, AMC options, saying that they‚Äôll increase margin requirements instead.   They also talk about the underlying having increased margin requirements as well, so I‚Äôd assume the restrictions were lifted for the stocks as well.  Either way, with option back in play, we can keep gamma squeezing the MMs with those deep OTM calls.
19 and I like the stock
Put what I could into BB, don't let me down

A prophet here, have some news on GME on monday
I just woke up, had this amazingly vivid dream about GME. Good news, it's gonna go up, bad news. You motherfuckers start preemptively selling and it can't fully reach what it could. I jumps from 420 at opening to 1k steadly and pretty quick, then a massive sell... it drops to 20 dollars instantly. It jumps again, but not back to to the hundreds easily, it steadily climbs, and reaches 500, then 4k then i myself placed an order at   miself. And i sold. Cuz i knew you motherfuckers couldn't hold it. And i was right, it peaked at my sell... And then it went down to 17 bucks, and. It stayed there...  Don't let this happen, don't sell on monday           Not a financial advice, i litteraly dreamt of it. I like the stock. I'm retarted. Don't listen to me. I eat crayons.
Diamond hands not enough. GME Price Surge -> Gamma Squeeze -> MOASS
Good morning fellow degens,  GME has already changed my life more than I could have imagined and I know that's true for many of you. But I'm not selling yet!  I want to see this thing through so I'm diamond handing my remaining 1000 shares. However, I came to the realization that   diamond hands may not be enough  .  Let's review where we're at, but let's do something to make it a bit more interesting. For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the  worst case  for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.    Assuming Worst Case for Retail      All shorts are new shorts     Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.   But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.   Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought.    Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that.    This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.   Gamma squeeze sqouze     There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.   The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares.    This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.   I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's  .   Whales are big for a reason     I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?   So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.   Check out /u/jkn_k's   which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme,   they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.   So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.   But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).    What If? Worst possible future for retail    Here's how this could play out poorly for retail:    Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not  too  high.   Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.   Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.   Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.   The share price falls and retail take massive losses.   Game over. :(     What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS      Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.   Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze.    A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS.    Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.   This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.   The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea. Maybe someone with more wrinkles can tell us?   I want to give credit where credit is due here: /u/Pyr0smurf's posted some great DD on this to /r/options because it looks like they're banned atm from /wsb. Anyways - they make this  !     Why I'm Bullish on the Gamma Squeeze Next Week      It's in the whales best interest to see the price goes up to, so retail has professional re-reinforcements   We have several possible Great Men of History - Cohen, Musk, Chamath - who may either buy shares or announce news that shoots things skyward leading to the gamma squeeze   Retail interest is INSANE. Billboards? I love you guys. That is incredible.    Worldwide interest? Really?! Beautiful stuff. Hats off to europoors and other brothers and sisters around the world as well - much love for holding the line.    tl;dr       HODLing may NOT be enough to trigger the MOASS. Buy gme, buy gme, buy gme!                      üëâüëàüí™  Positions: 1000 shares of gme  This not investment advice. And I'm not suggesting anyone make any actual moves or listen to me in anyway. Look at my past plays. Most of them are terrible. I somehow lost money on the Vegas play over the summer and I've lost money on TSLA more times than I like to think about. I bought BABA right before the ANT IPO didn't happen - then doubled down (that may work out yet though). Anyways - this is all for entertainment purposes!  EDIT: Added emojis heh

A LITTLE PRE-GAME MOTIVATION FOR YOU APES
Looking for people using SwissQuote
Hi everyone,   Looking for people in Europe trading with SwissQuote as I have couple questions about it.   I‚Äôm looking at changing Broker after Revolut instantly cancelled my buy order and sell limit order every time I‚Äôve put one on Friday. I‚Äôm concerned about what might happen later and how they will find a way to fuck us like robinhood did with our fellow Americans Brothers.   I‚Äôm looking for something similar to Fidelity in the US if anyone have another alternative they know about in EU (doesn‚Äôt have to be fee free just an honest broker that will listen and execute orders properly).   Thanks to all.
A note to hedge funds, financial authorities and the media in anticipation of next week
Hello fellow apes,    Disclaimer; I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice or an encouragement to others to take certain positions. I am fully retarded and had crayons for dinner last night. Also, I wear a helmet all day long and I can‚Äôt even cycle.    In anticipation of next week, I need get something off my chest regarding the financial authorities, brokers and the media. We all know how Wallstreet has ruined the economy over and over again with the 2008 crisis being the most recent one. What was Wallstreet doing when the economy collapsed and thousands lost their home and ended up in debt? That‚Äôs right; celebrating with their buddies because they made billions. They were literally laughing at the little man from their balconies while sipping c . What consequences did they face? That‚Äôs right; none.  Now a bunch of retards on an internet forum found out about Wallstreet making two mistakes of monumental proportions; - Shorting more than 100% of a stock- Grossly underestimating how stupid retail investors really are Now, as a consequence $GME surged to unprecedented levels and it seems the finishline has not yet been reached. Consequently, a few hedge fund managers are starting to get nervous because the red numbers are running up. Luckily for them, they have billions and friends in high places that would not mind a share of those billions. The result? Brokers shutting down retail investors, whereas hedge funds could short  and buy the stock freely. Some brokers actually may have had problems with clearing houses, but all of you know which brokers did what.  The ultimate goal of this short ladder was to trick people into selling. Unsurprisingly, they did not. The aftermath of this showed that hedge funds and brokers are holding hands and probably clenching their buttholes too.  It also showed that the media is beyond willing to stick their neck out to protect the big boys. The media have been portraying the hedge funds as the ones that REALLY know what they are doing, unlike those bubblehead retail investors. Simultaneously, we were described as ‚Äò‚Äôan alt-right platform‚Äô‚Äô. What?! We are a literal bunch of individual retards who just happen to like the same stock from time to time.  Financial authorities are calling market manipulation by retail investors. They are saying that hedge funds deserve the time to ‚Äò‚Äôrecalibrate‚Äô‚Äô their   are saying they needed to halt trading to ‚Äò‚Äôsave the financial system‚Äô‚Äô. Well, let me tell you this; If the survival of the financial system is so strongly related to the survival of a hedge fund IT IS YOUR SYSTEM THAT IS   don‚Äôt know man, but last time I placed a shitty trade I did not have the opportunity to call my billionaire buddies to ask them to halt the market so I can ‚Äò‚Äôrecalibrate‚Äô‚Äô my positions. If you make a dumb financial decision, you take the L and that‚Äôs that. The rules should not be changed after the game began and more importantly; the rules should be the same for everyone.  For years people have wondered how those people on Wallstreet make so much money. They have been shouting the answer from the rooftops for a long time; ‚Äò‚ÄôBE GREEDY‚Äô‚Äô.Wallstreet deemed itself absolutely unbeatable but the retail investors listened and they are   arrogance and blatant market manipulation backfired and exploded right in their faces and to be honest; they deserve it.  I‚Äôve seen dozens of articles about this not being the real value but in the end a stock is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it AND WE LIKE THIS STOCK. And let‚Äôs not forget guys; Since when do hedge funds give a damn about fundamentals? Thanks to Wallstreet we have seen unimaginable surges and crashes throughout the years. But now they are suddenly crying over fundamentals and about how they just want to make a living? Get of out of here,   to the market manipulation last week it became obvious that this is not even about fundamentals; the free market is free until the poor start taking from the rich. Extreme surges are apparently only market manipulation if hedge funds are not in on it. Politicians, celebrities,  and working class people alike expressed their indignation about what happened. Hedge funds crossed a line here and the anger towards them is not misplaced. This no longer is about fundamentals (okay it kind of is because the short squeeze thesis is legit), but this is now also about morality. Hey Wallstreet and financial authorities; By trying to manipulate the market and squeeze some measly dollars out of retail investors you have turned yourselves into the biggest antagonists on the planet.  So to any financial authorities or hedgie spies reading this; I am holding my $GME. If it goes to 0, it goes to 0 but I am not selling.  To all my fellow retards and everyone around the globe following this; May the odds ever be in your favor and may your trip to the moon be pleasant. Godspeed retards  Here are some obligatory emojis;   +   +    = üçóüçóüçó     Retard out.

GME - Bullish Pennant - This will go much higher before it goes lower! - UPDATE
GME is in a classic Bullish Pennant pattern now.               The bullish pennant is one of the basic patterns traders learn to recognize when they start trading.  Looking at all the technical indicators of this chart GME should be ready to move higher by roughly the same length as the previous rally before the consolidation happened (the triangle shape is the consolidation).  If the plot that on the chart we end up at $933 for the next peak, so yeah $1000 is probably really not a meme, its fucking possible for sure.               Of course it only happens if enough people buy the stock on monday, but with   mil degenerates on WSB and the entire world hearing about GME for a straight week in the news, smart and dumb money will flow into this stock on monday.            Meanwhile the SPx, SPY, QQQ, are all looking super bearish, and ready to do a steep correction, so probably GME is one of the only safe stocks out there to invest in right now. The rest is all a short!!!! This has been brewing for a couple of months, and many respectable hedge funds indicated end of december they expected a -10% correction on the broader markets in Q1 2021. That means tech, and finance, and everything will go down (which has been already happening last week).  This is not financial advice or any kind of advice, this is just one autistic degenerate talking to himself. I WOULD NO NOT BUY THIS STOCK, it's highly volatile. It might cost you all your investment.  That being said, it did buy this stock again on friday and I have been feeling sick all weekend. If you can handle the stomach churning and dizzying swings you probably are just as autistic as I am, and this is a great stock for such retarded degenerates who want to prove their manhood in other ways than banging their girlfriends sister.       üèΩ        üèΩ    EDIT:  1. To those thinking I predict 933 as the top with this post, no that is not what I am saying, I just think that's a possible next rally, and 933 could be where the next consolidation happens, but maybe this could go much higher. Also you all peer pressured me into holding till I die, so I guess I will never make bank on this one. 2. To those saying TA does not apply here, I believe TA always applies anywhere, but TA is only 20% of trading analysis, the rest is   wait you are saying fundamentals went out the window in 2020? ..... so yeah, this is just 20% of analysis the rest is I DUNNO WHATEVER, WELL SEE, still better than the casino's. 3. I got many questions where to find charts like this, it can be found on tradingview dot com website where many traders share charts and ideas. 4. probably this is a retarded analysis, I told you I am a total degenerate autist, don't get worked up about it, print it and wipe your ass with it for all I care, put dont bash me, jezus, you really would bash an autist retard? what kind of human being are you?  edit 2: added the rockets            edit 3: added the diamond hands      üèΩ        üèΩ      anyways, nevermind all that stuff I said above, if there are still shorts who need to cover maybe this willl go to 2K instead or 3K, who knows at this point anything about anything? I certainly know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.

Jim Cramer Gave an Interview on how the Hedge Funds Manipulate the Markets
Time to show them the Power of Destruction (Fun fact: I didn't even have to change the original subtitles, because they are so damn accurate LOL)

"The Clearing House Ate My Homework"
Just to be clear, the whole "the clearing firm can't handle the liquidity!" is bullshit. We've heard rumors that RH interns have heard of calls from Citadel to put a stop the sales. Last Thursday it seems pretty obvious to me that Citadel needed a price crash on Thursday for them to be properly hedged for Friday in order to prevent a gamma squeeze.    #Evidence    1. The original, official statement from RH was that the stock was too volatile and that we needed to "be protected from ourselves." Even if they wanted to just give a basic & vague explanation, "the market is facing internal liquidity issues outside of our control" would have sufficed.   2. The CEO of the Chinese company WeBullShit decided to give an actual explanation where he said it was due to the clearing house. Except that doesn't explain AT ALL why trades were only halted in one direction. Why can I sell a share on RH but not buy it? If it's true that their clearing house couldn't handle the traffic without massive collateral, it makes no sense that trades aren't blocked   bi-directionally .   3. TradeZero's CEO said he just argued with the clearing house and they backed down LOL. How is that possible if their official stance is "Sorry bro this can cost me billions of dollars in risk" ???   4.      > To be clear,   this decision was not made on the direction of   any market maker we route to or   other market participants  .    #Explanation    I'm not saying that the clearing house had nothing to do with it, but it's obvious that they're struggling to get their stories straight. Why wouldn't they have straight stories from the get-go? Why has RH's explanation changed twice now? Why is the clearing house able to support GME trades for some and not others?    Citadel was about to get gamma squeezed again last week to a nuclear moment of naked short margin calls, liquidity problems, possibly clearing house issues, and end-game market crashing. Cramer's gone from "Woo! Fanboy for WSB to play both sides!" to "Okay you guys won... pack it up... please???" Those who are in-the-know know that this thing is about to crack the fuck open. There have been several ominous tweets we've seen here already regarding Citadel doing shady shit and the market being on the verge.    TL;DR: Citadel is at the heart of all of this and calls in favors to make it happen. RH changes their story three times. I don't want to see any fucking "I feel bad for RH for being misunderstood" shit -- they are feeding you bullshit and you are eating it like a sundae.

Issues with Stock Lending - Securities Investor Protection Act
I'm only highlighting an except about stock lending that should be noted, especially when a stock is shorted above actual available shares.       Scenario:     1. You rent out your car 2. The party you rented the car to, doesn't bring it back 3. Insurance pays you  market  value (which is different than replacement value and deep fucking value) 4. You can't get another  like  car since it's more rare than when you first got it.   Edited analogy/hypothetical.      I turned off stock lending and plan to hold my pitiful 7 shares of GME and 100 AMC for the long run, and I'll buy the dips. I believe any company that has access to the amount of capital that they both do \ should\  be able to pivot and succeed. Were in the beginning guys, believe! I held JCP until the end and watched as they were unable to obtain any credit given their market cap. I sold my 400 shares of GME in April and now I hold in their memory. I'll take these 7 to mars on a SpaceX rocket.  Never Selling!  ü§ö    (and for the algos/lulz üçâ)
Asian got your back, still holding strong  ü§öüèª and plan to add more next Monday
Thanks $AMC and all you tards, I started saving late for retirement but this caught me up! Love yous!
Short ladder attack explained
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) delayed competitor Novavax (NVAX) coronavirus vaccine efficacy trial in the  , which just proved to be the most effective vaccine in overseas trials.... oh and Robinhood banned you from buying NVAX the other day when this stock went to the moon.
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) strong-armed Novavax (NVAX) out of a manufacturing agreement with Emergent BioSolutions (EBS). Thereby delaying Novavax's Phase 3 efficacy trial in the  , which just proved to be the best COVID-19 vaccine candidate in overseas trials. So now instead of manufacturing the best coronavirus vaccine, Emergent is making product for money grabbing bureaucrats... oh and Robinhood  banned its users from buying stock in Novavax the other day.       Novavax:      96% effective at preventing infection from Wuhan Covid-19 and 100% protection from severe disease.   85% effective at preventing infection from UK variant and 100% protection from severe disease.    Above combine to   prevention in UK trial.    60% effective at preventing infection from SA variant.    Johnson & Johnson:      66 - 72%  effective at protecting from moderate to severe disease from Wuhan covid and 85% protection from severe disease.   UK variant protection unknown.   57% effective at protecting from moderate to severe disease in SA variant.                                With this much conviction behind my thesis you bet your ass I own shares of Novavax.

Important! GME Short attack tactics predicted in 2014! All the tactics used in the recent week by hedge funds revealed and explained
All the tactics Hedge funds are using to crash GME prices were revealed as far back as 2014 in this article:         TL;DR:     Ladder attacks to drive the price down, Media assults, Brokers pulling margin, Paid bashers, Diversion attempts - all tactics seen in recent weeks were predicted by this article from 2014               --   Transcript if website crashes due to traffic:             --    Anatomy Of A Short Attack    Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.             --    Typical tactics include the following:       Flooding the offer side of the board    Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares.   They will do what has been called a short down ladder.   It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.    By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral.   If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of "strategic fails-to-deliver" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will "mask" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to s  the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other "success" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.  Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called "crashing" the stock and a successful "crash" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash "stick" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:             --    Media Assault      The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.    The shorts have "friendly" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the "friendly" reporters worked for The  , an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's  by a factor of one million times. This "mistake" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation "Due to a mathematical error" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The  , best described the media function:  When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The   have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.             --    Pulling margin from long customers      The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.               --    Paid bashers    The shorts will hire paid bashers who "invade" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).  This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.             --    Analyst Reports    Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned "friendly" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.             --    Planting moles in target companies    The shorts plant "moles" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.             --    Frivolous SEC investigations    The shorts "leak" tips to the SEC about "corporate malfeasance" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed "confidential inquiry" is leaked to the short media.  The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.             --    Class Action lawsuits    Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.             --    Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc.    If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.

Jim Cramer admits how market manipulation works
If you want to watch the video, search on youtube   " Jim Cramer explaining the basics of stock market manipulation"  "What's important when you're in that  hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the  truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new view,  to create a fiction."  "Then you  call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in  Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to  give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today,  and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game."  ‚ÄúIt  might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would  be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also  keying on Research in Motion."  "A  lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a  stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could  drive the futures. It‚Äôs a fun game and it‚Äôs a lucrative game."  "Who cares about the fundamentals? The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks."  \- Jim Cramer, hedge fund manager from 1987-2001, Dec 2006

If you're buying silver, comment here! (not for judgment, for news-purposes)
The news is saying Reddit (which would have to mean WSB, I think) is buying silver. I don't see shit for that here. So here are choices:  --It's happening, but you're getting downvoted --It's happening but no one's posting about it (  how does the news know it's happening?)  --It's not happening and the news is wrong --It's not happening and the news is lying   If it's happening, I'd like to know. Are you buying silver? No judgment, I don't care what you do with you're money, but it's just weird that it's getting reported but doesn't seem to match the mood of the board.

DD on GME, AMC, SPG, and more
I have 27 shares of GME, looking to get into AMC potentially.  I have calls of SPG, and I have calls on a shiny thing that shall not be named.  This DD post is primarily to ask the mods what is allowed at WSB anymore.  Are we allowed to post any plays other than GME? Are we allowed to have diversified holdings of risky bets?   I made my shiny metal post on Wednesday and had no idea it would get the attention that it did. I‚Äôm an average autist and I‚Äôm willing to speak to any mods if they want to set something up.    The religiousity and cultishness in here is getting out of hand.   God forbid someone post a play about tesla or Microsoft calls or even a bearish play on anything.  I miss WSB of two weeks ago where it was all actual debate or funny memes and rockets.  Now it‚Äôs all conspiracy theory memes and panic and only GME posts are allowed.  Feel free to change the post flair mods, it‚Äôs only related to DD in that I‚Äôm asking if we are allowed to post anything other than GME DD
Ask yourself, why is the media pushing silver so much? Why so much effort to lie?
Popeyes want to give us free chicken
I think its time to do what you retards say
I have been in the sub for a while now, way before all the $GME shit and I have always enjoyed watching you make or lose a shit ton of money but never rally thought it would be a good idea to join in on the fun. I was secretly an r/investing and r/stocks member trying to blend in here because I like the memes.  After the recent events I have taken a decision, fuck ETFs fuck real companies with real fundamentals. Its time to do what you guys said, I want to make big fucking money and I wanna be in the next time something like this happens.  So welcome, u/Matrix10011.   Its time to learn the ways of the autist.

Some of y‚Äôall are looking for too many x baggers, too quick. Buying at the ask and selling at the bid because the fomo monster got you by the dick. Let me give the young accounts a market lesson real quick.     Time in the market > timing the market    You wanna make money - I get that. You wanna double your money too - hell maybe triple it - this year. How many trades have you done since Jan 1st? 10? 20?   30?   Have you doubled?  Did you know you can double your account with 7ish 10% moves? Yeah, you‚Äôre gonna have some big boy wins, and a bunch of 20s and 30s if you‚Äôre good, but if you made more than 7 moves and didn‚Äôt double your money you‚Äôre either too greedy and missing peaks or losing too much.  1,000 invested, with ONLY 10% wins:  1) 1,100 2) 1,210 3) 1,331 4) 1,  5) 1,  6) 1,  7) 1,  8) 2,   I fall victim to this shit too. I‚Äôm up 20% and I get greedy and it drops to -40% and then I gotta manage my position so I don‚Äôt get clapped. Go slow, be vigilant, make money with purpose not by accident or a roll of the dice.   TL;DR. - less trades, more wins. Win % beat occasionally baggers in the long run for most investors.
Boycott robinhood!
A swift reminder of why you shouldn‚Äôt trust those short reports
I get it, you read you fucking nerd. But guess what? When all the data you‚Äôre reading from different sources regarding short reports are conflicting (big word, stay with me) then you CANNOT state any of that data as a definitive conclusion. If everyone is running the same experiment and coming up with different conclusions, it means no one has  any  fucking idea what they‚Äôre saying. Why should I trust any of these reports over the other considering they all say different shit?   You cannot trust a single science experiment and uphold it as the truth until it is verified, as we know, science is based on  facts  not the word of some pencil-dick nerd. Until we get aligning stories and numbers, do not trust the short reports.  TLDR;       üõ∞ üõ∞     fwaaaaaa   edit: since I took it too far and mentioned science around a bunch of apes, I‚Äôll explain. The scientific method can be applied to everything that includes data, including your wanking sessions.

IF YOU GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE $GME FRENZY AND ARE NOW CONCERNED WITH LOSING YOUR MONEY, DON'T PANIC. YOU STILL HAVE TIME TO MANAGE YOUR LOSSES.
Full Disclosure: I still have long options and hold a small number of shares but cashed much of my position late last week.  I'm down on what's in play, but overall way ahead.   \ -   Many here will immediately downvote this because they do not want you to consider any potential future other than the rosy, all your dreams will come true picture they've been hyping over the last several days. They want you to hold no matter what happens. That's not because it's in your best interests but because it's in theirs.  They'll tell you to ignore the naysayers. Ignore those trying to keep you from achieving your dreams and that anyone telling you to do anything other than HOLD is a corporate shill working for the hedge funds. Now ask yourself, why?   What you have to remember is that you are playing against the smartest, most well capitalized and technologically sophisticated people and organizations on the planet.  Yes this is an unprecedented event, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways for this to be resolved and avoiding the infinity squeeze that everyone here is praying for.  You're fighting an uphill battle against a relatively small number of organizations that are playing both sides of this trade already.     There's still time to limit your downside risk    Gains and losses don't exist until you exit your position. Until then, all you have is a paper gain or a paper loss.  If you have gains, you should take some money off of the table. If you have losses, ask yourself how you would feel if you woke up tomorrow and that money was gone. If you are truly ok with that, then by all means, ride this roller-coaster to its end, whatever that end may be. If not, however, you should really think twice about whether you are ok with that.      THIS ISN'T FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). THIS IS COMMON SENSE    I'm ok losing the remaining holdings i have in $GME. This is a small amount of my personal portfolio. Many on here may not be in the same position. I've read countless threads and posts of people taking their last dollar, siphoning credit cards for cash advances, taking loans on their  's insane. Yes it's a unique situation, but the professional traders who have done this and do this every day, all day for years and years can act faster than you, have a strategy and have the capital to chip away at this making money regardless of what happens going forward.      Wallstreetbets is not some magical subreddit with inside info and guaranteed path to millions     there are some very smart people here, don't get me wrong. I've made a lot of money that i never would have had i not dug into the info that I was first exposed to here.  But, for every legitimately smart investor/trader/autist on the sub, there's a cohort of people who want nothing more than to separate others from their money and have no qualms about manipulating you and your desire for an easy win. It's human nature and it's been happening for as long as people could understand the concept of easy money.  If you've read the recent reports on Silver, that's an example of a small group of well-coordinated people taking advantage of the situation with newbies and others who may not even be on here. That said, im limiting this to $GME.     NOBODY IS GOING TO TELL YOU IT'S TIME TO SELL. THEY'LL ONLY TELL YOU WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD    It's easy to get everyone on board with idea to buy, and when you're being told the price can go to $10,000 (I've actually seen people legitimately saying it could go much higher), the price you buy at doesn't matter. The same cannot be said for the price at which you sell.  Reading the threads, it might feel like everyone is acting in concert, but not everyone on here is honest. Not everyone here is doing what they say they're doing. Not everyone here gives a damn about you, even if they say they do. Don't allow your confirmation bias to convince yourself to do something you know inside is a bad decision. Invest only what you can afford to lose - period.     Winning a war against Wall St. sounds great, but you really need to understand what you're up against    Shares are bought and sold by professionals in fractions of a second. In the time it took you to read this, the price of GME has fluctuated by as much as $60.  Those who want to pull on your emotions are going to do whatever they can to have you focus on the Us against Them argument, but the fact of the matter is Robinhood isn't a very well capitalized organization, which is why they aren't allowing larger share purchases. Other brokers that don't have the volume that RH has had are taking orders without restriction, but that's because they have not yet hit the level of volume where their clearing capabilities and capital requirements will come into play. If everyone from RH suddenly went to WeBull  for example, you'd likely see the same thing happen there once volume in GME spiked.      BE SAFE. BE SMART. RISK ONLY WHAT YOU CAN LOSE.   TL/DR: Think for yourself and make decisions based on your own risk tolerance. There are people acting in their own best interests who need you to act in a certain way in order for it to work. This is a zero-sum game. if there's going to be winners, there have to be losers.

Where were you when a subreddit filled with retards and apes were one of the most reliable sources of financial news?
I haven't read any real news for a while now and only depend on memes for important world events (not joking, I found out about covid due to memes and anything big and important enough will get memed) and then research things myself because I haven't trusted any media for a long time  This GME situation has only re-enforced my belief. After this is all over and I'm rocking 8 digit stealth wealth, I'm just gonna fucking build a village somewhere in the wild and live isolated from society fuck this shit

A quick word about the current silver situation. (DD)
Despite all the shit being tossed around here about silver, here is the deal.  There is a VERY real situation on the available PHYSICAL silver you can buy. The stock SLV is so trash, it doesn't even keep up with Physical silvers price.  TD Precious Metals has been down for 2 days. Online stores are VERY low on stock.  >In response to the rapidly-evolving COVID-19 situation, the TD Precious Metals digital store is currently unavailable, but please check back later. Thank you for your patience  Locally you could call up your silver dealers and a lot of them are simply NOT SELLING! It's WILD. Just think, about this idea. let it ponder. Back in the day, 1 oz of silver = 1 dollar. If 1 OZ of silver was worth even 1% of our monetary system it would equal 2 MILLION DOLLARS an OUNCE!  Buying silver right now is insurance you have for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. You really can't go wrong.  If even 6M people (IN THE WHOLE WORLD) bought 1500 worth of physical silver, the shortage would be SO GREAT, the price would increase over 1,000 / oz.     >  Constraints in Supply  Why can‚Äôt we just mine more silver? The reason we cannot ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem by mining more silver is the cost. Today for example, to mine gold, it takes $350 \[to $450\] to mine, refine, and bring to market one ounce of the yellow metal. With gold trading around \[$1200\] an ounce, that is a profitable endeavor. Silver however, is mined \[primarily\] as a by-product. In order to mine one ounce of silver as a primary metal, the cost associated with it is similar to the cost of mining one ounce of gold and with silver trading around \[$17 ‚Äì $18\] an ounce and would not even be close to profitable when the mining costs are factored in. Currently we mine around six hundred million ounces of silver each year while industry consumes about eight hundred and seventy million ounces. Can you see a disparity developing? The market is tightening.     TL;DR Read the constraints in supply, and this -> 130% of YEARLY silver harvested, is used in Industry!!           NOT A RED HEARRING BOYS. I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. IT'S HAPPENING, ITS REAL. SILVER IS MORE RARE THAN GOLD. BUY UP BOYS.     LEAVE THE PIXELS BEHIND. ITS NOT ABOUT YOU VS A BANK. IT'S ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES.           edit: If you think I AM the shill. You guys are using money that was inflated 30% in 2020 ALONE. You have no backing. Silver is more rare than gold. You can't hide facts. You brainwashed fucks.        WOW: BIG EDIT: 26 replies in 3 minutes saying im a shill? Seems like BOTS to me. LMFAO  THE BOTS KEEP REPLYING WTF. WHY DO THE BIG BANKS THROW BOTS SAYING DONT BUY PHYSICAL SILVER?!?!?! LOOOOOOL   BUY PHYSICAL SILVER BOYS.

What this could mean $GME
We can see large downwards swings in the price, but then a gradual increase. The question is why?  My smooth brain tells me the short ladder attack is causing the decrease and the increase is driven by a huge and steady demand from retail. The stocks being shorted are being bought! HFs are pushing it down and retail are holding the line, adding to their positions.   This is coiled up like a spring, and could reach beyond the moon.   Disclaimer: this is not investment advice, just the ramblings of a mad man. Do your own DD, this not even DD, it‚Äôs pure speculation on what‚Äôs happening in the market.   Positions: 10 GME, price target $5000 per share.  Edit: just run GME through my pricing model and as a result I‚Äôve updated my price target to $10,000 per share. Any HF interested: this model + lessons in risk management are available for purchase.

I think something more sinister is going on with SLV
Maybe the goal isn't so much getting WSB to go to SLV (although that'd be a bonus for the powers that be)  But to pull shit on SLV (or hell why stop at SLV) and pin it on "the barbarian reddit mob", complete with a few threads talking about it  I can't put my finger right on it, but I know I'm not the only one that feels something is off  Way too suddenly, too many "people" all too surely show up - not to join the loud growing GME party - but to forcefully try and change the party mid-way  It's just not natural  Anybody would either come here and join or get out of the way/watch, not somehow change the tune  Then, SLV just magically pops ~7% like the next day or two - which is something WSB absolutely cannot do - we barely got tiny little GME off the ground after months of DD and argument  Nothing about this feels genuine  This absolutely  reeks  of institutional manipulation  Like some egotistical little bitch that gets off on gambling with peoples' money is mad they lost a bet and might actually have to pay something so they come in here and try to pull this  SEC go get these cunts  Holding GME

Warning: Chamath might be a snake
Before you downvote, listen to my thought process    "At 3   on Thursday, Tenev said that Robinhood's operations team was sent a file by the clearinghouse that handles all stock trades - the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) - requesting a security deposit of $3 billion." - Vlad     (Could be true or not, ill give it the benefit of the doubt)    Chamath didnt give RH the benefit of the doubt and went straight on media to blast the company to get retailers on his side.  Why would he do that?   1-  He is also running for Gov of CA so he needs the attention of the people.    Having retail on his side makes it much easier for him to win.    2- chamath shills sofi (IPOE SPAC ) which also sells order flow.      chamath says Robinhood is bad because it sells order flow data       "   Facebook and Robinhood App  are the same: They both trick you into thinking you are the customer. But, in fact, you are the product and your data is the asset.   "   \-Chamath  On SoFi's website, they claim this is in the "best interest of consumers" because it allows commission free trading. Huh!   Notice their execution partner is the clearinghouse Apex, which also restricted GME and AMC trades like RH. But it goes farther! (Cant post link, check on sofi website)      Tldr: This might be another case of a billionaire taking advantage of retail.

False news??
It's like a poker game
If the majority of people actually have the stocks, and they refuse to sell, and the shorts are in fact using phantom shares, AND stand to lose from this fuckery....     THEN, that would drive demand up, furthering their losses, driving more demand, furthering their   infinite divine wrath.  Hence why hold to the moon.  Because we think they're bluffing. And when they push the price down, more people buy because we think they're bluffing.  $1000 from my end seems like a good buy in to see their   potentially get the feds off their lazy fucking asses.     These are all musings, not financial advice. I just like the stock, videogames have allowed me to connect with real autists.          \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~>

I think that the Silver hate is actually what they are looking for. Here me out before you nuke me.
Preface: BUY GME DONT SELL HOLD AND FUCK CITADEL.  I am not preaching for people to buy into paper silver stocks. The criticism that the market is too big to be influenced is correct. There are way more paper silver shares in circulation than there is physical silver to back it up.      I hope you all realize that the Hedgies understand that this sub will have an adverse reaction to anything they do to try and move people off of GME. They understand that promoting silver will get the reaction that it currently is: people saying that silver is a trick and to forget about it.   Paper silver shares are not the move, obviously, but Silver still has the potential to be the next big move if we approach it correctly. EMPHASIS ON NEXT\  DO NOT SELL GME OR MOVE INTO THIS POSITION UNTIL THIS WAR IS OVER.  If people start buying physical silver and demanding delivery of their paper shares, it will result in devastation for the Hedgies and Big Banks. This is why they are pushing paper shares so hard to get WSBs to call off the dogs on silver all together. Don't underestimate your enemy, they understand what reactions their actions will get.      Silver can be the bullet that pops the everything bubble, but it needs to be done in a specific way. If the tutes that are trading all these paper shares that represent far more silver than actually physically exists, then demanding delivery will force them to pay any price to get the material. If the retail market is buying up that physical stock before that happens, they are fucked,      This is still the long play imo, but I have been in this space for many many years. It is a solid investment regardless of what the outcome is in terms of damage to the tutes. It could be the best next move in this war, but we will see. I am long silver, but I am a physical collector. I think the anti silver hype that has gained traction here is exactly what they are after.      My suggestion is that we just ignore silver all together for now, but don't forget about it when the GME stage finally resolves. That is what they want. Let's win this GME short squeeze before we promote any other moves, but be extra vigilant of any moves they are making through their media cronies. They are learning what their actions result in, and they will use that to manipulate you away from the things they don't want you focusing on. I truly believe this is a fake out, and we are giving them the reaction they desire by killing any and all moves into the PM space.      Thats just my opinion though. Do as you see fit. GME to Pluto. GG NO RE
Vanguard no longer letting you trade stocks on new money in account.
Transferred some more money from my bank into my Vanguard account this weekend.  Just spent the morning trying to buy the dip.  >"This order can't be accepted because it would exceed your current available balance. "  Talked to a rep at vanguard, and as of TODAY At 6am, you can't buy with money until it's cleared your account (aka 7 days.)  So wire money into your account, rather than transfer it.    Just an FYI.  Yes, I understand why the changed it.  But no, I don't like it.  AND IT is especially funny, because my limit for GME went through this morning. . .using the same money.  I'm a trained monkey, this isn't advice.

Ford Motor Company, will they respond to GM with an all electric model lineup?
Consider Ford motor company on the chance they announce an all electric lineup. GM just made this announcement for 2035 and the stock market loves it. Ford is already rumored to be building an electric F-150 for 2023 and as much as I love Pappa Musk and his Cybertruck I think this is really going to be popular with average American consumers. Ford is also making the electric Mustang SUV and I know a lot of people are pissed about the use of the Mustang name but in all honesty that car looks bad ass.  I like this options play because the spread for options dated two years out is really tight. I understand this is because the volatility is low and the chances of Ford hitting that price are remote but I'd gander that's in the absence of new information about an all electric lineup.  Electrified F-150 article:   Ford (F) Jan 20' 23 $15Shares are cool too!  EDIT: JUST A HEADS UP FORD HAS EARNINGS 2/4

WALL STREET PLAN - Trying to psychologically scare you with MANIPULATED BIG DIPS and then a SMALL recovery. They want to MAKE YOU DOUBT, that the NEXT BIG DIP, you could‚Äôve SOLD at Recovery. This has been going on since Thursday for GME & AMC
Everyone,  TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!  AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!  Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits.   1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS 2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU 3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED 4)HOLD AND BUY     üåï  5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è 6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN  7) DO NO LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS.

I want a megathread where we can document all illegal or shady activity and keep track of it.  Examples might include: your broker selling your stocks, limiting certain trades, putting an automatic stoploss on your stocks, etc.  We need to hold these firms accountable and these valid complaints should not be lost in the noise.

MORE TRICKERY: GME attack explained
REPOST FROM FRIDAY NOW THAT IT'S RELEVANT. u/SNICKYSNACKS THE PREDICTOR.   BUY THE FUCKING DIP. THEY'RE PUNISHING THE RETARDS THAT HELD CALLS TO EXPIRY WITHOUT ALSO HOLDING ENOUGH MONEY FOR THE SHARES.       TL;DR   >Not investment advice. Market goes up and down, I think GME will go up. But this is to protect the true retards that held FDs through to expiry on a low budget account.  >They could potentially do a short attack to lower the prices enough that brokers margin call the owners of ITM calls on Monday. You can short the float for 100 shares, essentially making yourself delta neutral to protect yourself, then you get rid of them both on open with full gains.  Price is down $20 AH so be prepared for the morning dip. More scare tactics.  So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.  In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be <$320)  But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.  Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)  Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300.  This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.  If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.  It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.  To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:  HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.  HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$  Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s  Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.  They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.  Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now. Should be quite interesting to see if it holds.     u/snickysnacks get in here so they don't think I wrote this.    I'm long GME. This is opinion only and not investment. I'm also not responsible for any temporarily capped gains because you don't understand the words delta neutral.
I‚Äôm sick of the media lying, I‚Äôm sick of these weasel hedgefunds. I sold all of my other shares at a loss just to buy GME. ALL IN YOLO DIAMOND HANDS
I am depending on you retards to hold, because I fucking know I am. Come pick me up on the way!!
AMC, GME, BB and some others - It‚Äôs NO COINCIDENCE that the stock that were trending since GME explosion are being manipulated since last week. DO NOT FEAR! HOLD AND BUY!
Everyone,  Do not fear and panic sell. If you pay attention to most stocks trending on WSB, they were moving up and down simultaneously. When GME was down like 100 points AMC was down 10 points and BB 7 points. When GME moved up a little bit AMC, BB would also move up. Wall Street is trying to get you to Sell after a big dip and a little recovery. Psychologically they WANT TO. Scare you  since last week being manipulated by Wall Street.   With the restriction of how much you can buy is restricting your gains and causing you manipulated losses. YOU ONLY LOSE IF YOU SELL!  TIME is the enemy for Wall Street because they can continue restricting purchase and manipulating the price down but they still have to cover and pay interest   With the restrictions of how much you can purchase, I would load up on GME first and then AMC. Or whatever you can get your hands on  JUST HOLD AND BUY! We are going to        üåï
Thanks for the ride GME gang. I haven't had this much fun since MSTX.
I bought GME as a value play last year. I bought more after the earnings crash and got really excited when Cohen came on the board. I figured that I was all set, that my $18 avg cost shares would soon be worth $50 or even $60. Wow what a return! Then I heard about the squeeze thesis. I figured it was WSB nonsense, but buyers are buyers. I wrote   and you degenerates seemed to love it. I didn't know how close to right I would be.  It‚Äôs been a wild ride, but today   and let the rest ride. I still have ten shares and really hope that they go to $1000 or more. I‚Äôm taking a safer long position by selling $40p weeklies. I‚Äôll be buying in post-squeeze regardless of what happens. But in the meantime I‚Äôll be using my gains to pay off student loans and live a debt-free life.    Why did I do this? When I see crowds ignoring information just because they don‚Äôt like it, I get scared. S3 came out with some numbers over the weekend that indicate a lot of shorts have covered. Is that solid? I don‚Äôt know. But it‚Äôs enough to tell me I should be cautious. Nearly 60k out of the sky is something I‚Äôd be stupid to let slip away. If you have money you NEED in GME, please take it back. Let your winnings ride, but don‚Äôt risk your mortgage. Buffett says to be fearful when others are exuberant and exuberant when others are fearful. GME gang is just too exuberant for me.   Plays like GME come once or twice in a lifetime, and I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable risking (for me) life-changing money on a chance that it‚Äôll become slightly more life-changing. I wish you well. I look forward to seeing the gain porn if I‚Äôm missing out on something huge. Please be careful, please stick around if you intend to be a positive part of WSB post-GME. Please fuck off if you don‚Äôt.    I hope the squeezening happens and makes you all rich. Now go learn what an FD is.  EDIT: Apparently this is one of the most controversial posts on Reddit in the last hour. I didn't even know they did that kind of analytics. If you're downvoting someone who's telling you they just changed their life because they're not risking their future on the same thing as you, ask yourself why that makes you angry. I'm still long GME. I think that Ryan Cohen is going to do incredible things to the company, and I'm still risking my money on that belief. So why are you mad?

STRATEGY: Supplement GME losses while you HOLD by buying Amazon (AMZN)--it's going to moon tomorrow
This isn't an exit strategy, it's a HOLD strategy, while making money on the other side. Amazon is reporting earnings tomorrow after the bell and they're going to blow it out--nobody on Wall Street thinks differently. Ask any of the old timers here, we all know this to be the case. Go check the stock price after each earning session if you don't trust this DD. Just go do it.   Hold GME, buy AMZN.  Come back and thank me on Wednesday morning. You're welcome.

Because the swings can seem scary, let me blow the clouds away and put light on da wae. Stop eating your crayons and let‚Äôs begin:  From all the media manipulation, trading app closings, and other shenanigans from the hedgefucks, the most ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù and objective of them all is the short ladder attack. Oh did I lost you, you cute smooth brain ? ELI5 here it goes : whales short a small amount of actions between them repeatedly so the algorithm thinks action going down. But guess what... IT IS NOT.   ‚ÄúBut oh fucking retard‚Äù, you might say, ‚Äúhow do we know if the dip is actually a BS short ladder ?‚Äù LOOK AT THE VOLUME TRADED!!

Buy GME stocks instead of YOLO on GME weekly calls
Currently, TDA has restricted selling GME calls, even covered with stocks. Not sure if this applies to other brokers. I can give TDA the benefit of doubt, since them still allow GME stock trading.  What this means is that MMs like Citadel now have a monopoly on GME options selling. They have jacked up option prices to obscene levels. That in itself should make gamma squeeze harder to trigger, and I bet they figured out other ways to avoid another gamma squeeze on GME as much as possible. Currently there are 6600+ open interest on GME 02/05 800c. Citadel could easily have made 50 million++ on this. Paying interest on shorting GME is a piece of cake in comparison.  Position: 800 GME.   This is not financial advice.     TLDR, buy GME stonks and hold, don't YOLO every penny on calls. GME

Retards, let's not forget the importance of WSB and the quality of information we share we can't let them think we are fools and uneducated bag holders.
I have been here for 2 years now and yes, we uncovered something to capitalize on but with all the posts flooding this amazing subreddit, we are starting to look sloppy. Let's all collectively be smart about what we post and the information we share.  DFV didn't just spam reddit with his thoughts on GME. He took the time to be critical and piece his thesis together to make an educated and informed decision.  Same goes with stocks like NOK, AMC and BB, it is not about making a quick buck but making a smart play.  I want us all to succeed and not look like fools when the manipulation done by hedge funds thanks to RH is done.
MarketWatch blaming us for the SLV ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù
Listen up idiots who keep saying "dOnt bUy SLV!"
You're right, don't buy SLV. It's paper silver and is manipulated and shorted by COMEX and JP Morgan. Remember now Gamestop had over 40% more shares being shorted than their are shares available? Well the same thing happens with Silver. NOT SLV. ishares Silver Trust IS NOT SILVER.  I REPEAT. ISHARES SILVER TRUST (SLV) IS NOT SILVER.  iT'S PAPER. ITS WORTHLESS.  Companies like $AG, First Majestic Silver, silver mining companies and actual PHYSICAL SILVER are a good actual investment.   I get it, monke buy GME, apes strong together, but guess what. There's more than one play here, especially for people who missed the GME boat.  $AG is a good investment, and the CEO is hated by everyone who trades silver because he wont join the COMEX loser who suppress the price of precious metals like gold and silver.  positions $AG 3/19 $25c

GME short interest news - use with caution
Before going into news about short interest, I want to make clear that this data is generally not exhaustive and can never be seen as real-time. Also in light of the diversion and fake news tactics we can now observe, e. g. concerning silver, all data has to be regarded with caution.  Short positions have to be filed officially but with some delay. The last official update is from January 15th, 2021 and showed around 123% of GME float shorted. In the meantime, market intelligence firms provide reports about estimated short interest, which they sell as a product along with news and analytics services. Among these firms are IHS Markit Ltd. and S3 Partners.  According to Markit, short interest is now about 39%, S3 Partners states around 50%. Both values would be well elevated compared to the rest of the market. We also don't know to what extent these alleged numbers include new short positions at higher prices.  However, since the enormous short percentage of GME and the extreme increase in price, it can be argued that the short squeeze is not over and will continue, if the stock price stays elevated.  The short squeeze will only be over, if the shortsellers have abandoned old positions and are comfortable in new positions, if the intend to open them.  GME's stock price over time is one of the deciding factors here. If the price moves in favour of shorts still holding their positions, the may decide not to close them. If price stays elevated, additional shortsellers may need to close their positions, sending the price up.  Source:    Sorry if this has been posted in the meantime. I always take my time writing posts because I crosscheck with other information sources available to me.  \#WeLikeTheStock  \#Edit 1: For anybody criticizing this post: the percentages are, regardless if the allegedly came down, extreme numbers. It is logical that the massive increase in share price came due to some positions being closed and therefore Hedge Funds suffering. But the shorts are still in and that is why they use all their foul play. Someone on here recently deducted how high the percentage of retail holders could be. It was estimated 10 shares per user. The float is only 50m. The big squeeze is not off the table. Don't jump to conclusions because my post doesn't contain rockets and so forth. The best rocket is the one in your portfolio.
ANOTHER RETARD HOLDIND. WE ARE IN THE TOGETHE. STAY STRONG. THIS DROP IS ONCE AGAIN ARTIFICIAL. INTEREST IS BY FAR NOT LOST

BUY THE DIP - AMC TO THE MOOOOOON!!!!
$FUBO DD
Not sure if everyone here is familiar with the Twitter folks, but @MrZackMorris and @JoeAlertz are in this looking at it as the next squeeze. No limits on it for Robinhood. It has a 75% short interest, plus a 52 million float. Very similar to GME. Over $50 break this will fly to the moon. Got some $50 calls for next week at the dip from today. Holding strong. üí∞üî•
I‚Äôm trying to buy through Fidelity and keep getting this message. I do have the $$ I want to spend but it‚Äôs not letting the purchases go through. I‚Äôm a new ape. Someone dumb it down for me.

Bought GME about half hour ago. Why is it still pending? I'm using Revolut.
PSA Robinhood will allow you to exercise options in GME  over the phone  (but not through app)
They are  NOT  allowing you to exercise options in the app because "it would give you more shares of GME than allowed" (cough, bullshit, cough).  However, I was just able to exercise 10 contracts via a customer support agent over the phone.  In case they change policy, you may want to record the conversation for any potential future litigation (doesn't hurt). Remember, the CSA is  just doing their job .   DO NOT BE MEAN   to them, these things are 100% outside of their control.

If they keep trying to push SLV down WSB's throats.
"What's up with my BANG stock" or why you might not see the price movement you want until Wednesday (particularly $GME)
The four BANG stocks are still trading restricted on certain platforms.  Many of you smart traders are switching to platforms such as Fidelity and Vanguard that will let you trade what you want.  Unlike Robinhood, I know Fidelity doesn't have limited margin because I myself switched to Fidelity from Robinhood a year ago.  What does this mean?  It means if I did a deposit into Fidelity today, it might take a day or two for the funds to clear into the account.  Fidelity will NOT let you trade funds that haven't cleared.  So for instance we're seeing a dip in $GME today.  I wouldn't be shocked to see it stay down until Wednesday when people's funds clear and they can buy again.  Same with the other 3, if they take a dip after I post this don't be shocked and don't panic sell either.  Nothing I post is financial advice, I hold the Guiness World Record for World's Dumbest Human.  TL;DR- Ape not sell, but ape not able to buy today.  Ape be able to buy in day or two.
RED MEANS BUY THE DIP
I know it‚Äôs not a lot compared to some, but we‚Äôre in and holding.
How long will this ¬´short ladder attack¬ª last? Im a retard sorry
DON'T PANIC AND JUST LOOK AT THE FUCKING VOLUME
If you are panicking go to your shitty robinhood app and change it from a line chart to a candle chart, the top will show you a volume. The total since 9:30 is less than 2 million. Think logically, if this was a true panic sell do you really think the volume would be 2 million. There is   million retards in here. If we all panicked the volume would go through the roof.  This is another attack by hedge funds to force a sell-off and is absolutely meaningless since no retail investors are selling.  BUY THE FUCKING DIP. WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED LONGER THAN THEY REMAIN SOLVENT  EDIT: I believe Robinhood does not even report volume properly on their charts. Anyone who was saying the volume on the day is 15 million or whatever is correct and I should have thought to check a better platform before making this post. However, there is no denying that this is just another ladder attack that will prove to be ineffective as anything under 250 is a fucking discount. To put into perspective the last attack which was on Thursday        Notice the huge red dildo staring at your face. Now look at the bar under that dildo, that is the volume. Is that move remotely justified by that little volume? Look at the previous days where there was massive amount of buying going on, volume was 4x on those days compared to Thursday and yet those candle sizes do not even compare.  To make this more understandable look at the retard on your left and then look at the retard on your right. FYI THEY'RE NOT FUCKING SELLING.  Note: This is not financial advice and i dont know what i even wrote up lol i just really like gme lol

The truth is here in this subreddit - The Short Squeeze hasn't happened
Just so we can plan this out - much of what you read here at the top is truth. Some sprinkling of bullshit but truth for the most part. I've been seeing articles on major news about The Short Squeeze happened and What we learned from the Short Squeeze and all of that... the fact is, we are still knee deep in Short Squeeze. So let's lay the media lies out there:  1. The Short Squeeze isn't an event that just ends, it's an event that happens. You'll know when it happens and you'll physically see it happen here. 2. No one here is buying silver. If you have it great! But no one is buying shares of SLV. CNN reported it jumped 8%... bullshit. Notice the Silver shit started after the markets closed... it's a   to get people thinking silver is the new gold on Monday. Remember - you can buy Silver or you can keep buying         (Not financial advice. I don't own a stake in any diamond mines) 3. The Hedgies have not sold out of their positions in GME. That is misinformation. They simply cannot which is one reason why people think RH is limiting trading. If they lower the stocks prices, it's going to be cheaper for the Hedgies when they are forced to purchase and spike GME leaving us with winners and losers, but as long as they lose, we all win. 4. The media, the Hedgies, the brokers... they are working against us. We need to support each other.   I know that there is a lot of retarded talk and this is in no way financial advice. I didn't even talk about buying anything... I'm just here with some solid consolidation of who you can trust and as many retards are here... most of these people you can trust cause they aren't smart enough to fool you.     So - what can we do??? There is only one thing.         to the mother fucking

The Red Herring: SILVER BEING USED AS A DISTRACTION
For almost 48 hours there has been a fabricated buzz about silver prices rising. Major media outlets seem to be pushing the narrative that Reddit is now moving on silver. However, when referring to the  ‚Äôs on Reddit its easy to see that absolutely no one shares the sentiment.   SILVER IS A RED HERRING    üèª   Remember if you sell your stonks to move into silver or any other dumb shit fake new move you won‚Äôt be able to buy back into the real money makers!   AMC GME NOK BB is where the money is at baby   üèª üåï   It also appears that Citadel which is one of the big loser in the GME squeeze stands to benefit significantly from a surge in silver prices. Do your own research but it all seems super sketchy!   (This is not advice)
BANG is BS. SLV is BS. There is only one squeeze. Game   Stop.
Mods, message for you at the bottom!  There is only one stock that can squeeze to infinity. You know what it is.   Look, if you are a well intentioned or a confused autist, I get it, you want to make money on whatever it is. But AMC is not on DFV's DD. BB is not. NOK is not. Fucking SLV certainly is not.   True autists only want ONE thing: $GME          Mods! How about a moderate temporary ban on those other Tickers? Too much? I know nothing and you are the judges, but it is my suggestion.

Remember the 4th quarter right?  I remember even my 83-year-old mother did all of her Christmas shopping online for the first time ever.  remember the seasonality of the online retailer which is not priced in at all?  Remember they've already put up guidance towards the top of the range?  Remember Amazon's one of the top beneficiaries of the pandemic, and the fourth quarter surge?  Remember Amazon benefits on both sides of the stimulus checks?  remember a company with a history of managing expectations and exceeding earnings?

Chose an amount I'm willing to lose, bought shares of GME to do my part. Let's go tards! (rocket emojis)
I've been tracking this since November, but thought that Wall Street would find a way to crush this.   Then Thursday rolled around and I felt smug because there was indeed Wall Street, brazenly cheating to crush it, and then you insane tards doubled down.  So I picked a number I am comfortable losing and I bought shares of GME which I will diamond hand.   I remember Occupy Wall Street and thinking how stupid it was, despite agreeing with the sentiment.  This is different, this is an actual financial revolution that can make real change, so I am in.

How to sell own body to buy GME?
Mods please allow this. I am genuinely curious what body parts, fluids, or solids I can sell from within me to buy more GME shares. Since I was blessed with getting coronavirus a couple months ago, I heard hospitals will pay for me to donate my blood? They might have to look past the needle marks but I‚Äôm sure I can sell it for a 50% discount. What about stool donations, or skin grafts? Also willing to sell my bone marrow for transplant. If anyone needs hit me up for pricing. If anyone has other ideas let me know. I really like this fucking stock.   Positions: 25 shares and holding   , would be 50 but my wife‚Äôs boyfriend owns 50% of my assets.

THEY ARE HURTING! RBC (Royal Bank of Canada) DIRECT INVESTING HAS DISABLED ALL GME eTRADING.
BEWARE CANADIAN INVESTORS. This brokerage has disabled all trading and the only way to buy or sell is to call in (which takes hours). On Friday they screwed us because we had two, 135 calls, hat were deep in the money and we wanted them exercised. We waited for over 3 hours and then the hold dropped. We messaged through the site telling them to exercise them, even though they say not to message about trades, but what choice did we have. At 3:50 they sold them for premium and essentially robbed us of 200 shares. Now, we can't even trade on the site. Run.  WE ARE LONG IN GME AND WE LIKE THE STOCK. HOLDING TO THE MOON.

Incredible AMD financial report that seemingly flew under the radar during all these GME posts
Haven't seen a post about something other than GME since this sub was flooded by millions of people, so I figured I would mention something new. AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:    Record revenue for the year with $  billion in revenue   Q4 Revenue up 53% to $  billion (also record quaterly revenue)   Gross profit up 53% to $  billion   Net income up to $  billion compared to $170 million a year ago   EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $  per share   Cash flow up to $554 million YoY   Q1 2021 guidance:   in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin   FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY   Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future  Su bae has been delivering hard on her promises, and I see no reason for this momentum to not carry forward into 2021. They have gone on sale after earnings, and I can't wait to see what AMD has in store for 2021.

We‚Äôve broken Fidelity
Hi, user of WSB, RH, and Fidelity.  Fidelity has been my main broker since I started investing last year, and today, I noticed something; I can‚Äôt get on. I can barely log in, check my positions, or check quotes for stock price. Fidelity‚Äôs servers are getting completely burned by the new influx of users (you guys).   We got a lot of power around here, but I‚Äôm kinda annoyed that my favorite broker is just fucked by the insane amount of new activity

This was never political. This was never about bringing down a system. Too many new shills gobbled up what the media had to say.   It‚Äôs painting us as trying to be intelligent and we are clearly retarded.  Sir, this is a casino. This is not a political statement or movement.   Don‚Äôt let the media speak for us.

We need a new flair for non-meme stocks
This sub has turned into GMEbets and everything else is being downvoted. Yeah, GME is the hot stock now and there are a zillion new users; but this is getting ridiculous - even the Daily Discussion Thread has become a GME thread, even though there's a separate GME Discussion Thread.  Mods - you've been doing a great job; but I think it's time to make sure this sub doesn't turn into a meme stock sub (assuming it's not too late already).  I suggest the following or something similar:    New post flair for non-meme stock DD and Discussion. Meme stock posts with this flair should be deleted.    AutoMod should delete comments in Daily Discussion and non-meme stock posts that mention meme stocks.  The "meme stocks" filter should be a dynamic list and updated as needed - starting with GME and, maybe, AMC.     u/zjz    u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR

Organic growth vs manufactured
First off I'm an idiot just like the rest of you, this should not be taken as financial advise and honestly you probably should stop reading now as there will be no pictures and I know reading hurts your brain.  GME incredible growth is 100% organic momentum that started over a year ago.  You cannot recreate this with anything else.  It took months for GME to even get started on this path and it wasn't smooth sailing.  Diamonds take years to form under high pressure, no smooth brained autist is going to diamond hands AMC to $300 ok its just not going to happen.  In conclusion I have no idea what's going to happen, have fun out there.  Position 5 shares of GME

Death and Taxes
Good morning autists! Due to the large influx of new users, I think it's a good idea to go over a  very  important aspect of trading -- taxes.  Now, there have been multitudes of sick gains posted over the past weeks. You may be thinking of dropping yours on a new Lambo, and rightly so, but before you do, make sure you determine how deep the Tax Man is going to have his hand in your pockets come next year.     # Capital Gains  A Capital gain is exactly what you should expect: a gain realized from trading something of value. When you bought 1 GME share for $20 and sold for $500, you realized a $480 capital gain.  Capital gains are taxed through two different schedules in the   Long-term Capital Gains tax and Short-term Capital Gains tax. Again, as you might suspect, these taxes are applied based on how long you held the capital.   To qualify for the long-term capital gains tax, you must hold the capital for more than one year  . Everything else is taxed as short-term.  Note that this only applies to those without   , as you are only taxed on gains made from closing a position ( realized  gains).     # Long-term Capital Gains  Now, if you saw the original comment by our lord and savior u/DeepFuckingValue and jumped in at the same time, you would qualify for the long-term capital gains tax:      $ Amount Tax Rate   :- :-   $0 - $40,000 0%    $40,000 - $441,450  15%    $441,450 - ‚àû  20%   The brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer.       # Short-term Capital Gains  I would imagine that most of you did  not  jump in with DFV over a year ago, and thus are subject to the short-term capital gains tax. Short term capital gains are taxed as regular income, meaning that it is summed with any additional income you make throughout the year at a regular job.      $ Amount Tax Rate   :- :-    0 - $9,875  10%    $9,876 - $40,125  12%    $40,126 - $85,525  22%    $85,526 - $163,300  24%    $163,301 - $207,350  32%    $207,351 - $518,400  35%    $518,400 - ‚àû 37%   The brackets above represent taxation on a Single taxpayer.    There is a caveat to the tax brackets above -- Federal income tax is applied at a  progressive rate .   If you make $100,000 at your job this year and a $70,000 short-term gain with GME, you might expect to pay a 32% tax and owe $54,400. However, you actually would only owe $35,    The progressive rate schedule means that the first $9,875 you earn is taxed at 10%, then the next $30,249 ($40,125 - the $9876 which was already taxed at 10%) is taxed at 12%, then the next $45,399 is taxed at 22%, and so on.     As you can see, it is much more tax advantageous to hold. Even the federal government wants you to hold.   SO HOLD.       Disclaimer: I am not a tax professional. This only applies to   residents. The information herein is only in respect to   Federal   tax. There may or may not be state-specific tax as well. There are  many  other factors that may increase or decrease your taxable income. Certain equities/equity derivatives are taxed differently than stated above. If you made bank over the past few weeks,   TALK TO A CPA  . My limited knowledge of tax law could be wrong -- if you see a mistake, leave a comment and I will correct it.       tl;dr:     that in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except   death and taxes.   Do not spend all of your gains without accounting for taxes. The tax man  will  have you pay in some form or fashion; whether it's in cash, repossession, wage garnishment, or jail is up to you.     # Sources:

In case you needed more proof that the 'silver squeeze' is nonsense
hello apes,  This morning I read an article in a newspaper about how ''redditors are collectively hopping on the silver train''. The article in question was from FD, basically the Dutch Financial Times.  It's about the following article;      We all know damn well that the ones who bought GME are still holding it, and that no OG WSB member cares about SLV. So I asked them about their sources to justify an article about Redditors buying silver and they replied with these two sources. They basically said that they get first hand information from analysts and that they are not writing anything that is not truthful. Additionally they said they are aware of the market sentiment but that they are also aware of ''redditors driving  up the price of silver''. I sent them eight of the most popular posts of WSB of the past 24 hours to point out the market sentiment (which is GME). They provided these sources for their article;  1.   2.       One of these posts has even been deleted! I pointed out that the accounts that promote silver are mostly new accounts, or accounts that have been inactive for a long time. They said they did not see any proof for that statement and referred back to two SLV posts here.  TLDR; Media ignoring the actual market sentiment  PS; Yes, I can provide screenshots of the emails I wrote, but they are not in English so I figured there would be no point it posting those in WSB.  Disclaimer; not financial advisor. Do your own research and make your own decisions

The truth your $GME sell limit orders keep getting removed - IMPORTANT
When you place a sell limit order, the broker you use might not be able to lend your shares to the shorters anymore. This might be the reason why some brokers are now removing your sell orders, because by removing your sell order, they can lend your shares to the shorters (without you realizing).   Put your sell limit orders at $4K - $5K, or tell your broker to stop lending your shares out.   There is debate whether or not putting sell limit orders will stop brokers from lending out shares. But at this situation, I find it very odd that many sell orders are suddenly removed without consent. Guess theory does come alive after all, shorters need more shares ;)  This is all my own opinion. Do your own DD. Good luck apes
There is not much money left after building a house and having a children but I support retardness from Europe! We love the stock!
How close are we to flat out owning Gamestop? Can we help turn this company we just bought around?
Someone posted an interesting idea the other day about GameStop launching its own version of twitch. I don't know if that's a good business strategy or not, but for those of us who really are holding for the long term, we'll at the very least have a large block vote in shareholder elections.  What if we could do more than that? Maybe somehow we could help steer the actual company and help make this share price sustainable for the long haul.  What would you want to see this company you helped buy do in its newfound position?
Greetings from Belgium! May the stonks be bountiful today!
Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt)   during the week. It's already starting.
The number of posts with supposed "level headed" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to "rethink your strategy" but still "Go GME!! I am one of you guys!", always with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.  Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.  Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

The big question we have to ask ourselves
We have been setting our targets all the way through this, now we're coming to the part we will start hitting these targets, so what we have to ask ourselves is what do you, not as a group but as an individual want to see GME hit, yes $1000 would be nice, is that realistic I mean yes for a paper handed bitch, $5000 still nice, but yet again I ain't no paper handed bitch, $10-20k this is where we start seeing the real diamond hands popping in, we can still ride through that and push for more, people may tell us we're greedy for aiming high, however, what do these hedge funds do when shorting, aim as low as possible which shows they're the scum of the market, we're here to see these companies thrive which we will see especially after the squeeze we've saved AMC, we've saved AAL, and we're saving GME from being bullied into bankruptcy, good job with all on this my fellow autists.   Also this is not financial advice, I'm just a retard that's hyped

Let's not mix up $SLV and actual silver !
Alright, here's the thing.  If there's truly a conspiracy about silver, it's not the bullion. Buying silver (and gold eventually) is something you can't go wrong with. Silver is seriously undervalued and its price is being manipulated down. You see, being long precious metals is basically shorting the dollar. And with the money printer going brrrr there's no doubt that inflation is going brrr aswell.  It's fucking BLATANT how the price is manipulated. Silver is supposedly a trillion market, but the actual silver that's on the surface is much, much less than that. T  here is likely LESS fine silver bullion on the surface than there is fine gold bullion.   Why ? Because we humans use much much more silver than we use gold for industry. Yet we don't extract much much more silver.  Thing is, we've been shown that markets can't be trusted. $SLV is just fucking paper. It's nothing. It's not something that'll get bullion delivered to your house.  # TLDR ; hold on to your precious GME   shares, do not fall for the $SLV trap, secure your future tendies in ACTUAL METAL you can TOUCH and that no Robinhood-like is gonna block you from trading.        # Fuck $SLV and bullshit paper, love the actual metal.  This is not financial advice, do your own research and stop eating crayons like I do.
Yo listen up autists, if unsettled fail to deliver trades on GME last 30 days or longer, it becomes known as an aged fail and your broker is on the hook to buy out your share. That's why Robinhood is restricting trading, not collusion by hedge funds
A fair warning to everyone involved in this one in a million situation .
First of all  ü§ö GME to the    Now to the meats and bones. A lot of you were not here last year during the market crash of 2020, but I‚Äôm here to give a fair warning that I‚Äôve learned from it.   Do not become caught in the endless loop of confirmation bias and echo chambers. Mitigate and decide your own risk don‚Äôt let the other influence you. Last year the    community was so deep in puts and would continue the jargon of  ü§ö even when the market just kept going up and up.   My point is don‚Äôt feel pressured by the sub to hold. Sell when YOU want to sell, buy when YOU want to buy and hold when YOU want to hold that is all  20 shares of GME 25 Shares of AMC
They act like silver is so fetch
Media Demonizing GME Buyers Will Keep Paper Hands Out
Last Post Got Deleted   Yes, all mainstream media sources are demonizing this subreddit and holders of GameStop in any way possible. But THIS IS GOOD! If we, as a bunch of unconnected retards who use this sub have decided we each individually LIKE THE STOCK, then we will all INDIVIDUALLY hold. Let the normies sit this one out. Let anyone with an IQ above 70 sit this one out. They will sell at a low profit and let the shorts off the hook. Let's go back to GME not catching much attention so we can resume with the squeeze. APES TOGETHER STRONG. None of our conviction has faded at all with media blasting us. All this has done is prevent boomers from frenzying into our beloved GME and ruining it by selling such as during the ladder attack. We will win this war via retard strength.  üôèüèª   üíπ

Account Transfer: If you ACATS transferred out of RH, you have "locked" your shares for T+2   will happen to GME...
Too Long Can't Read: HOLD GME!!!       First, I'm not an advisor or some quant with some bullshit MBA from a Top Tier school trying to scare anybody.   With everybody dropping RH like my ex-wife dropping me for Chad, I wanted to read on the process during the transfer of these accounts.   I noticed a post where Fidelity was up 700% in transfer requests this weekend. I would assume the same for other non BROKErages.   I have Fidelity and I use ToS for charting, but I read up on the process for transfer from RH. First you have to pay $75 bucks to get transferred from RH. That's a crock of shit but I guess its still "free" trading.   Secondly, RH will sell your fractional shares prior to transfer through ACATS (This is the system for "transferring" shares from one brokerage to another). This will take place prior to T+2 which is the SEC standard. Now when your transfer is taking place you do not have access to trading your stonks at all. Time to bring back the old PornHub..  Thirdly, all your limit orders have been canceled during this process. This means that if GME tanks (HOLD you dumbfuck) you will be out of it and just screaming at the screen seeing dildos (green or red) while your wife is boned by her bf.  Lastly, the process fully takes 10-14 days to "settle". You get credit for the stonks at T+2 but there could be restrictions on trading depending on the brokerage. Fidelity does not have this issue...  But   does this mean for GME? Well, kid...  1. RH will clump all the fractional shares from the transferees together and dump them at market per RH  > "If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep."         These will be gobbled up by hopefully the GMEGang but it will supply shares to the market. Depending on how many full shares this could minimal if assuming a .99 fractional share x RH transferees...  2. The GME shares that are transffered will effectively be "off the table" during the ACAT process which will lead to a massive "group" HOLD for T+2 days depending on when RH autists transferred out. This should cause a drop in volume since GME retards won't be able to trade but will help out as the shorts cannot buy these shares as they are out of play.  3. The process for getting margin approval and options access could take a few days due to the volume of transferees. This will show up as a general "pause" within GME as traders are waiting for account access. This could be good or bad depending on the view.   4. This mass transfer out of RH will be a blessing to them as they will not have to deal with the GME liquidity funding mechanisms.   Just my thoughts on everybody fleeing   will be a slight pause but that will give people a chance to poke around the platforms and get used to it prior to going all in on GME...  TLDR: HOLD GME!!!      <Almost forget these...>  Long: GME = 500 at 38 at Fidelity...
We should be compiling links of sources claiming WSB is for silver
We‚Äôre not. Plain and simple. Anyone who frequents WSB knows this.   This means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don‚Äôt do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.  If there was any doubt of these hedge fund‚Äôs influence and manipulate, this whole ‚ÄúWSB going silver‚Äù just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.      Edit:   You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like   "There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members"  . That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.  This goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing   who's   involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on.

Their attacks are also psychological, they don't just want you to give up hope, they want you to have hope and then crush it.
The more they lose the stronger they need to attack.  We know the media said short sellers covered their calls, this tho is a way to ruin you psychologically. When you believe in 1 thing and your hope gets crushed you'll feel sad, but when you believe in 10 things and all your hopes get crushed you'll feel depressed and hopeless. That's what they're trying to do.  They're trying to make you believe they covered their calls but we've seen today they didn't, they're giving you false hopes to later crush them all and make you feel like shit.  This'll probably work on the weakest of us who will sell cause of this, so the price may fall, except for another thing, as counterintuitive as it may sound (and a psychological war often is counterintuitive) they may even buy a lot of shares to let you see those big green candles to later sell everything and make you see the huge red candles caused by their selling and by the other investor's panic selling.  I wouldn't be surprised if they have a team of people with a psychology degree to help them achieve what they want.

Hedge fund go grrr.
You do bad. Hedge fund go grrr.  \      UPDATE 1-Hedge fund body alarmed by retail investor frenzy 'distortions'  2021/02/01 03:12  By Huw Jones  LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Wall Street's retail trading frenzy has distorted markets, global hedge funds industry body AIMA said on Monday, adding it was concerned that lawmakers were encouraging such moves.  Retail investors gathering in social media chatrooms like Reddit have been driving up the price of stocks like GameStop   shorted by hedge funds, with the focus shifting to other parts of the market on Monday, such as silver.  "What is dangerous, amid this trading frenzy, is that retail investors have been chasing prices so far above any sane valuation and that many will end up nursing losses," AIMA CEO Jack Inglis said in a letter to members, who manage $2 trillion.  "The role of some supposedly responsible lawmakers, who have been cheering these events from the side-lines, with a knee-jerk reaction against short selling, is concerning to say the least."    Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said last week that people felt "everyday people" were finally able to "get back" at those who had all the marbles on Wall Street and forced once hedge fund into an existential crisis. nL1N2K423J  Inglis said finger wagging at hedge funds was not new and short-selling is tightly regulated, requiring positions to be published, allowing others to trade against them.  Some hedge funds have chalked up losses and AIMA said it will help with regulatory investigations.  "Those exposed will have taken it on the chin and will have executed steps to contain losses for their clients, whose savings they manage," Inglis said, adding:  "To those commentators who have been clapping with glee at the misfortune of those hedge funds ... what we have witnessed in the past week is a game that has led to a gross distortion in both efficient market functioning and true price determination."

$NOK: Nokia Upped To Buy After Ericsson Results -- MarketWatch
GameStop Secondary Offering: What it might look like
Preface: Everyone hates GME thoughts that appear negative, if you hate this I get it. This is not meant as a negative scare tactic but only a potential hypothesis of what may occur.  1. GameStop has the ability to raise a secondary offering by issuing more shares into either the public or private markets. Technically, they can issue 300 million shares. Here is an SEC Filing from 2005   2. Even if the above SEC filing did not exist they would probably structure something to allow a secondary offering as the market has given them a second lifeline ( Just 1 year ago they were a company worth $200m today they are worth 100x that). 3. It is highly unlikely that GameStop will issue 300 million shares or even 100 million shares 4. I believe it is realistic to think that they may raise $1-2 Billion in a secondary offering probably some portion of debt and equity (not just flooding the market). 5. They could do this by either offering a non-dilutive secondary offering by selling their shares they currently hold, or by causing a dilution event and issuing more shares 6. In a dilution event this would look like adding 10% of shares to the market which will have some impact but doubt it will crater the stock. 7. Google raised about $4 Billion through something similar in 2005   8. In some ways it would be foolish for the company not to take advantage of the current situation and raise some amounts of additional capital.     TLDR: GameStop will likely do a secondary offering but it will be unlikely flood the market with 300 million shares.  These are just my best guesses not facts.

Stock Market News for Today   Is the Short Squeeze Over? NIO & other Stock Market News [02-01]
Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let‚Äôs talk about this & other stock market news    Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the   spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.  We saw over 70% of the companies declining   finishing in the red again, as Energy & Tech were the biggest losers.   So, let‚Äôs take a look at the HEAT MAP from    though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.  We also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable   also rising by   to close out the year.  Meanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment  , which also came in with a   decrease month/month.  This week we have somewhat of a quiet economic   take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google & Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm & Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.  In some other stock market news, we saw   reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021   , an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still   up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla‚Äôs EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.  Meanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms  , but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favorites   .  The recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his   showed that more than ¬æ of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.  Interactive   after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.  So‚Ä¶ I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second‚Ä¶ this one is very hard to predict‚Ä¶ Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocks      but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven‚Äôt helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.    And finally, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US  .    Thank you everyone for readingüôè Hope you enjoyed the content!

GME price target $2,  after short squeeze.
GME is no longer just GameStop. It is a revolution! It is regular people against the establishment. It's the unemployed bankrupting hedgefunds. Throw away your old valuations and look at this new. This is a   there's fucking value in that!  How high can this go? This is where Ryan Cohen shines. We never know how far he will take this, but I know the dude is fucking brilliant. So fucking brilliant that I'm willing to give him my entire 401k to make this happen.  GameStop is no longer a retailer, it is a viral company. We need to value it like a viral company. Look at Dollar Shave Club. (Almost) everyone buys razors and doesn't give a shit where they come from. But DSC changed everything. People WANTED to buy razors from DSC. I believe we will WANT to buy from GameStop. Fuck, I love this company (and stock) so much, if GameStop starts selling razors, I will buy them.  Dollar Shave Club was sold to Unilever for $1billion when sales were around $100million ($200million projected). I believe GameStop has more value. They are going to increase sales 3x or 4x. They will increase their online presence and start selling more products. This is going to be huge. My valuation of GameStop is 15x current sales, or $1,  per share and my target price is $2,  within 2 years.   The short squeeze will push this stock even higher, but for the long term the current price is a bargain.  I'M HOLDING THIS STOCK!  I know GameStop is a good retail company and I'm confident they will grow after this, but it is also personal. The criminals who paused my trades need to go to jail. When they get out, I want them to see a fucking GameStop store everywhere they go. Every shopping center, every mall, fucking everywhere! I want Gamestop to be bigger than Walmart. To do my part, I will buy everything from Gamestop. If they sell toiletpaper, I'll fucking buy.  $300/share is a bargain. Buy GME and hold  Not financial advice, do you own research I eat crayons when no one is looking HOLDING 150 GME @99 FOREVER!  Love you all!  Edit:
Shorts Playbook
Second time posting....hopefully the mods approve:  Hey fellow retards, I just wanted flag this great post by  . As always, assume what you will. Synopsis post below.  1. First, the shorts work with the banks to create fraudulent shares to drive the price down. This was most likely the cause of Thursday‚Äôs dip in GME‚Äôs shares. The HFs and the bank literally trade the same shares back and forth with each other to drive the price down in larger volumes than the buy orders and then never deliver the shares because they never own them in the first place. This technique is known as ‚Äústrategic fails-to-deliver‚Äù and is basically given a pass by the SEC. 2. Next, the shorts work with the usual media suspects and research analysts to push their lies. 3. Third, the DTCC, which is the central repository for all shares and owned by the brokerages, allows the creation of billions of counterfeit shares through a process called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) that never even make it to the SEC. This is where everything gets very murky. Naturally, the DTCC has resisted every effort at transparency. 4. Fourth, brokerages pull margin from customers causing a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Anyone seen that recently?)  The short's playbook today is the same as its always been. Only it never accounted for a WSB rebellion.  I highly suggest reading the articles because I‚Äôm only skimming the surface of how complicated and rigged the entire system is. Not surprisingly the root cause is the sheer amount of money involved for all the players.  TLDR: HOLD!

Senator Toomey said after losing our money, we will lose our enthusiasm and leave the market.  He has no idea. We love losses too! They think losses scare us.   He also said he doesn‚Äôt think that we shouldn‚Äôt restrict the market on either side. Retail or Broker. Good. This should give us the leeway to wreck more hedge funds.

A Torah based stock prediction algorithm using Judaism concepts
After unsuccessfully trying to discover--astrologically--a way to find something to improve the risk/reward ratio of this algorithm. I decided to turn to the Torah for help.      "At the end of every seven years, you shall celebrate the remission year. The idea of the remission year is that every creditor shall remit any debt owed by his neighbor and brother when God's remission year comes around. You may collect from the alien, but if you have any claim against your brother for a debt, you must relinquish it...." (Deuteronomy 15:1‚Äì6)    The correlation between Jewish Sabbatical years and major declines/crashes in stock prices is heavily studied. In the Judaism tradition, the number 7 holds great significance. Shabbat is observed on the 7th day of a 7-day cycle, the shmita or sabbatical year is observed on the 7th year of a 7 year cycle, and the Jubilee year is celebrated at the end of seven cycles of shmita.      I found a way to apply this concept of "every 7th year" to the algorithm and further improve its risk/reward profile. What I did was simply reverse the parameters of the algorithm during every 7th year of a 7 year cycle. Whereas normally, the sun traveling through a Dow drop prediction sector would mean the prediction of a market decline--now, in making use of the "every 7th year" concept by reversing the algorithm only during the 7th year, the sun traveling through a Dow drop prediction sector(during that 7th year) starts to mean the prediction of a market rise and vice versa... the sun traveling through a Dow rise prediction sector(during that 7th year) starts to mean the prediction of a market drop.

Hey Hedge Fund Intern Spies
If your firm wrote any uncovered GME calls that expired in the $ on Friday, your firm must purchase stocks on the market and deliver to the apes by Tuesday. I will sell my stocks at the market price Tuesday at open (even though your magic HFT algos have proven to highly manipulate the market price on Thursday), if three conditions are met:    Publicly apologize to the employees of Gamestop for shorting their company.   Publish your Loss Porn   Have your hedge fund manager reach out to our mods and submit to an AMA on this subreddit tonight.  Otherwise I'll hold my stock and one day gift it to my grandchildren. Not a financial advisor or anything, I just like the stock.

GME, my worst-case scenario nonsense
Narcissists are optimistic about themselves but pessimistic about everyone else.    As a programmer, I always want to define the best and worse outcome of an operation. As a pessimist, I prefer the analysis of the worst-case scenario.    For GME (20 shares on Robinhood), this is my 2c  (premise) I'm an early adopter of Robinhood, I came from the Scottrade platform. There, in the year 2009, I immediately blew 1000$ in absurd pink sheet trades and then hit my first 8000% return (on 20 bucks). So please don't give me shit for using Robinhood, let's focus on the immediate risk for who's holding using Robinhood (& co)  It's obvious that their software engineers and data scientists are working around the clock at Robinhood to release a growing number of kill switches on the platform, and they walking on eggshells.   They are most likely slicing and dicing data to find the shortest path to bail out their investors/owners.  Whatever they can not legally do, they might achieve with a self-inflicted DDOS.   There is so much money at stake!   You know they are combing through our data, they are building profiles and ranking users and their positions:         am     Your limit order was cancelled because the limit price you set was too far away from the market price.     You can place a new limit order if you wish.    I truly don't like this.        There could be platform outages during the squeeze;   There could be a "bug" that accidentally replaces "too high" limits with "market price";   Securities might be forcibly liquidated, while accounts are locked for technical reasons;  I am afraid Robinhood (and others) will be   thrown under the bus  , implode, take all the blame, the shame, losses and happily chapter 7 out of the way.

press releae, class action against robienhood
# New California Class Action Lawsuit Against Robinhood Alleges that Online Brokerage "Switched Sides" and "Sacrificed" Main Street Investors in Favor of Wall Street    PUBLISHED  JAN 29, 2021 8:00AM EST  LOS ANGELES, Jan. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --¬†A new class action lawsuit filed in the Central District of California alleges that behemoth online brokerage, Robinhood, breached its duties to investors when it "willfully and knowingly" disabled certain crucial and basic trading functions crippling its clients' abilities to trade from their accounts.  Main Street Investors  ¬†The complaint alleges that Robinhood clients who owned, or sought to acquire, shares of Gamestop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) and Blackberry, LTD (NYSE: BB), were damaged when Robinhood deliberately handcuffed their ability to trade, thereby benefitting Wall Street institutions.  According to the lawsuit, "Robinhood, famous as the c  of the small retail investor(‚Ä¶) Switched sides." The complaint further states that "Robinhood acted contrary to the interests of its clients and anointed itself as the overlord of the free market, opting to damage its clients in favor of its own financial interests and the interests of other market participants, many of whom had interests directly adverse to Robinhood's clients." The suit asserts causes of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Negligence and Unfair Business Practices, among others.  The case is Gossett, et al. v.

Help-out-a-billionaire thread
You know, traditionally r/wsb smooth brain has been a simple animal with a heart of gold. If things have gone wrong, you guys haven't learned anything at all from it. But if you have hit a jackpot, you have been generous with donations to charities.  But the one thing we haven't really shared as much has been the deep wisdom of the ordinary people from all walks of life. I mean, we would teach our own kids everything we know, so why not do the same for those struggling hedge fund managers, right? I mean, they are only trying to make living and are clearly in a need for some fatherly guidance (just not in the Vatican way of giving it), so I just though it would be time to make a concerted effort to give something back.  I was very inspired by the comments section at r/news, where people are already giving some very helpful advice.  u/Blank_bill suggested that they should invest their money. This is a solid advice. I've heard that McDonald's has been known to help learning this, so hedge fund managers really should give it a shot getting a job there. Like u/GhostofRimbaud said it, they should try looking in the paper and going into establishments with resume in hand, give the boss a firm handshake and ask for a job. I like this, it gives a good impression.  u/bill_hilly also very helpfully noted, that stock market has an inherent risk, so they should not invest more than they are willing to lose. But they could use that stimulus check to do that, u/dietsaddad was kind enough to point that one is coming in no time at all, just 10 short months.  Many people, including but not limited to u/BrownSugarBabe, rightfully pointed that skipping the avocado toast and Starbucks coffee and maybe driving an Uber would help to make up the difference. As u/artbored noted, they wouldn't be struggling nearly as much if they just skipped those $7 lattes.  That's an amazing insight and managers clearly should learn from this. They just have to, as u/csirke4 and many others pointed out, pull themselves by the bootstraps. Maybe learn to code Python or something.  Or perhaps, like u/WeAllSuk pointed, maybe they have some old video games that they could sell.  But if they can't get a job (although u/coachmdubz said the nearest Amazon warehouse is hiring), they could just, as kindly noted by u/Brewboo, "maybe take that unpaid internship and through hard work and determination one day they too can have a lucrative career."  This is amazing, with this advice those poor managers on a good career path in no time at all. Or like u/HeyItsTheShanster said, they could learn a trade and be their own bosses.  Personally, I believe families should help and support each other and it's very normal in most part of the world for the children to help out their struggling parents. I mean, camgirls are always wanted and there is always that occasional r/wallstreetbets millionaire in need of that special massage, that could really help to pay for a tuition if the hedge fund manager's paycheck from the Wendy's is not quite enough.  Now, I know what you guys are thinking: "hedge fund managers don't read reddit and those texts in billboards and behind flying airplanes are too damn short!" This is why we could use some outside help to make all the users' helpful advice more visible to them. Just like John Oliver always helped Trump on Fox commercial breaks.  But I'm sure those poor, struggling hedge fund managers could use all the advice $GME holders can give them from their vast life experiences. Now, we wouldn't want them have to sell one of their yachts, would we?  I am eagerly waiting to hear all the nuggets of wisdom you guys have to give for those poor folks at Melvin Capital and their friends.  Edit: grammar  Edit 2: since some people seem confused, let me clarify. Point is that one of the great pleasures of life is to piss people off by making them eat their own words. If you can make it publicly in an incredibly sarcastic and passive-aggressive tone, even better.  In this case, giving the reckless billionaire fucks running the hedge funds the same condescending advice "lazy" young people struggling with a low-wage dead-end jobs have been receiving for years.  Edit 3: It's one thing to shit on hedge funds by refusing to sell, but we can do better, we can really rub it in while we still have the media attention.   If even one person with journalistic or otherwise relevant background or any connection to reporters, actors, screenwriters or other people sees this and sees some potential comedic value in it and any of the lines end up being used somewhere, we might have been able ruin some bigwig's day. And it won't cost us a penny.
There is no silver short squeeze happening. NONE. NEVER.
Silver might go up nicely and for a time but don't get high on hopium, this is not gonna go in the 100s.     >A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.     >Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.  - >Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on   citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $  per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.  - >By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $  billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $  Such   speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $ , the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $  billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $  billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.  - >To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.

Possible (real) reason brokers are restricting buys on GME.
We wsb have many roles in this GME saga. One of them is the detective. It is up to us to figure out the crime and the weak point of the criminals behind the counterfeit stocks.   Here is a brief history of the crime.   1. Some hedge funds naked short GME and disguise as normal shorts in the system. This pushes short interest to 140%. This everybody agrees on.   2. DFV see this and starts a manic squeeze.  3. Massive shares bought by wsb and no doubt other funds.  4. As prices rose these buy trades start to fail, ie the seller fails to deliver the shares to the buyer after 2 days in settlement. You can see the volume on SEC fails website. Some guy tallied up to   shares failed when price was 10 in december. You can use your imagination what is the fail count at price 350. Note above 10,000 fails gets the stock on SEC watch list.   5. Because these shares failed to deliver, RH and all brokers faced a sudden margin call from clearing. Why? Simple, RH clients bought shares that are simply not turning up. So RH is essentially short GME stock to its customers. Hence has to post 100% margin instead of 2% and likely the normal interbank loan channels are closed for this high risk purpose.   6. What can brokers do? They can enforce a buy-in. That means they can force the seller to buy the missing stocks in market using funds in the shorts' account. The US buy-in rules are pretty complex but i understand that it is up to the buyer to enforce a buy-in. Ie RH has to initiate the buy-in.  7. What happens at buy-in? They bid for the volume at any price. The naked shorter goes bankrupt expending all their fund networth to buy stonks that dont exist from people who dont like them.   So key question is this. When will RH and all brokers enforce the buy-in and why are they not doing it right now?

Holding GME till hedge funds bleed out
BOOM (DMC Global) Fundamentally exposed opportunity due-dil #DYOR
Hey everyone!  I spent the weekend looking for good opportunities to flip wall street. I set out looking for stocks that have good technicals to pull off a GME style short squeeze. I think DMC Global Inc, trading as BOOM (yep, that really is the ticker), is our best play. Here is why.  To find a play, I am looking for companies that are way over shorted, that aren‚Äôt too big and that could be squeezed by a WSB onslaught. I looked for these things:  1. Stock where there is   more than 100% institutional hold  , which indicates naked short selling 2. Stock where there is   more than 15% of float that is openly shorted  , these are shares that have been borrowed and shorted. 3. Stock with a   reasonable market cap   so we can move it, smaller is better here. 4. Any other factors revealed by a review of the company.  I am not an investment advisor and I am not giving any investment advice. #DYOR I have an MBA and know how markets work. I‚Äôm a geek who got into coding and finance in high school and working and investing for more than 20 years. I bought my first Jag with investment gains and people asked if I was old enough to drive it! I also got screwed over multiple times by banks and institutional investors. In 2008, I lost 3 years of my hard work investing when a broker closed out some of my positions at the worst possible crashing moment (to protect me!) and left me holding a bag of shit. I watched my broker front run my trades. When started with OTC, I saw them settle their prop desk‚Äôs least favorable trades of the day to me. Robinhood didn‚Äôt invent this stuff. If you‚Äôre in this to change Wall Street, let‚Äôs break their trades and take back the markets.  First, I think targeting companies like Nokia is a bad idea.   NOK has a market cap of   billion and not enough shorts on it. It will be very hard to move such a monster. BB is another case with few shorts and almost 9bil mkt cap.   AMC with a cap of   billion is already a challenge. GME was around 2 billion when we started this and it‚Äôs 22 billion now - very hard to hold at this level. We have to ask:   ‚ÄúHow big is this challenge - a mountain or a boulder?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs on the other side of  the trade and how deep?‚Äù   Keep these questions in mind before we move.  Secondly,   this is not long term investing   \- we are playing a hard game vs. wall street. It‚Äôs about momentum and trade positions. Company data doesn‚Äôt matter: EPS, EBITDA, cash flow - it doesn‚Äôt matter for a short squeeze trade. With GME, we have given the company a great opportunity to raise funds and pivot, but its future depends on management. We bankrupted Melvin. That is our achievement. Our goal is hitting the crooks on the other side of these trades: Citadel, SAC, Robinhood, etc. The company is just the football in this game.  Two interesting companies are Teradata Corp and Allogene Therapeutics Inc. These are short squeeze opportunities as well. TDC, has a   institutional and a   short interest with a cap of 2.9billion. TDC is almost 4x bigger than BOOM, so it will be harder to move with lower beta and a lower institutional so moves will have less impact. ALLO, has a   institutional and a   short interest with a cap of 4.9billion. Price action is not aggressive either but Allogen 8x bigger than BOOM and could be much harder to move.  After looking at these and several other candidates, I found the best option, one that I believe could be successful in less than 3 days. It is DMC Global Inc. (NASDAQ:BOOM)  1.   DMC has   institutional hold   \- this means that there are hedge funds that have big short positions on this stock, many of which are naked. Naked shorts create the phantom shares representing 15% more than the float. Naked short is when you short the stock and the lender who let you short sell the stock actually didn‚Äôt deliver the stock to you. This creates phantom shares.  Let me say that again:  there are 115% of the issued shares in play, that extra 15% in play  does not exist, but is owed . These shares have been short sold without actually having shares to sell. 2.   DMC has   Short Interest  , so pretty heavily shorted. This means that pushing the stock up will squeeze that like a big zit on a small face.  This is way bigger % than NOK and BB who have a little zit on a big face. 3.   The market cap is just around 1 billion  . It won‚Äôt take huge volume to squeeze this one. 4. Other interesting features are a)   beta of    . The stock historically moves more than the market and b) recent price moves are up, but the   stock hasn‚Äôt had any crazy big run  , so there is a lot of room to push this up really fast. c) fyi: DMC has a real business manufacturing metal parts and accessories using explosives for the energy industry, 5.   It trades under ticker BOOM. This is a poetic bonus for this story.    After looking at these and lots of others. I concluded that the best play is BOOM, it‚Äôs just like a ripe cherry waiting to be picked. I can find no better chance of success than this: a perfectly sized company that is as leveraged and as owned by hedgies as this.   I put this out for everyone and let the WSB mods decide.   The situation won‚Äôt stay like this for long in these volatile markets, so if we decide to act, it must be now. Let‚Äôs make this week another one for the history books. This is our moment. Let‚Äôs change the world, one BOOM at a time!       Edit  : Position long: GME, BOOM, G bee tee cee, NO SHORTS and NO UNDIES EITHER.
New Fidelity Traders: A Quick Checklist to Sharpen Those Diamond Hands
Maybe you're a RH refugee, or you're a newbie to trading in general like me. Here are some tips to maximize your experience:     . No   emojis though.         \- you need to acknowledge some stuff that was too long and I didn't read. If you don't do this, you're 15 minutes behind.     \- Fidelity requires you speak with customer service and they talk about the risks of extended hours trading.     Trading on margin   \- you can call them to set up a margin trading agreement, but I don't recommend that because I'm an index fund boomer at heart.     Sell Limit Rules   \- Not that any of us would ever sell a stock we like so much, but Fidelity allows Sell Limits to be placed only 50% over the latest price. So we're gonna have to get well beyond $40k for us to be able to enter our $69,  sell limits.  Positions:    GME x 7 @ 336   AMC x 7 @ 13   Incredibly chiseled Diamond Hands from holding my index funds through 2008 and beyond  Anything I missed?  EDIT:  From /u/coderedrabbit  >ATP also let‚Äôs you bring up your own scanners that update live if you build them on the web base platform. Go to research > stocks > stock screener > create a scan.

Unable to effectively communicate the truth about "he who must not be named"
I am unable to find a decent write up of the founder of WSB and why he has been disowned by the community. There doesn't seem to be a good summary for the non-wsb (il)literate to understand why he doesn't represent the community.  I think this is one core reason why it's so easy for him to get the media attention that he has.  This guy is named in all of the "here's what is happening" articles and videos and I can't find a single simple breakdown of why the douchebag should not be associated with r/wsb and what is happening with GME et. al. in order to refute the reference.  Sure the subreddit knows, but plebs cannot be directed to a random collection of archived threads with rainbows and rockets and only u/<name> to identify the parties.  I dunno, maybe nobody cares and this is a stupid desire. On the other hand I am holding 30 GME so clearly my brain is well smooth.
Am I doing it right? Order $5000 per shares and this makes me half a 100kaire!

Our analysis suggests a decrease in overall shares shorted, dipping below the 30 million share level. (Watch this space for more analysis tomorrow.) Moreover, S3 data reveals that trading in the latter part of the last week gave short sellers exit points below GME‚Äôs high water mark levels and reduced their mark-to-market losses. A portion of Friday‚Äôs gains can be attributed to short sellers buying-to-cover shoulder-to-shoulder with long shareholder buying."  Where do we go from here? Is S3 fake news?

PAY ATTENTION CONCERNING FAKE NEWS
You might have noticed this weekend that the hedge funds tried to push silver (a great commodity btw) via their shills on the media (expect more this morning on CNBC).   Anyone who puts his money in SLV is literally giving money to Citadel as they are the 4th largest institutional holder ( .This is just a pure DISTRACTION at this time aimed at diverting attention from GME.  The   FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt)   have started  . They're trying to distribute lies to the public to reduce the hype and divert attention around GME.  So stay woke and keep your cool before we leave the solar system and the Milky Way          (This is not financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor  )
I just YOLO'd 130 shares at 43, $, I know it's not much but that's a big fraction of my savings right there, and I like the stock so I see no reason to not hold with some stronk diamond hands . To the Moooon  ü™ê
Complete lies. Stay away from silver right now
WE GOT THEM AGAIN! üí•
Don‚Äôt listen to them, this is them trying to take focus away from GME
RH Cancelled my 10K Limit Order last night, TD did it last week, RH did it last night
Havn't been to an AMC in over 5 years, I like the stock.
Shifting our attention from    no other targets here. lol
Linus is one of us!
Just invested my in my first stock being NOK wish me luck monkeyboys üèª  Im new but gotta start somewhere!
AMC and GME are following exact same patterns. Do not flinch.
AMC and GME are experiencing the same bullish and bearish behaviours and thus experiencing some wild volatility. This is all because of the market makers so do not worry, as this is typical and was seen all last week. Even if more restrictions will hit just hold and we will bounce right back up if the consistency of the holders stay unchanged.     AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.     Best advice is: hold and buy more as this is just the same garbage as went on as a result of the big hedge funds getting hit in the end of last week. RobinHood are still the puppy of Citadel and will keep on making this as scary for new investors etc.     And of course, I am only telling you this because I like this stonk :).  Edit: I am all in on GME shares holding from 130.  Edit 2: no need to message me. Not a financial advisor. If you are worrired about any of the stocks on here the best thing to do IMO is to hold.  Edit 3: this is a short ladder. Just buy up paper hands and hold forever.  Edit 4: Check out the frontpage.   "If you see GME falling quickly without volume , this isn't actual selloff of GME shares but a tactic of hedge funds to scare you into selling GME. Read this thread if you want to know more about this. The order book is filled with round number orders like 100 and 200, which is Citadel and Melvin just fucking with us.    DO NOT SELL.    GME TO THE MOON (insert rocket emojis)  edit: go buy gme on the dips you retards don't buy reddit awards but thx anyways  Obligatory im not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise."
lot's of controversity on silver in here, here's my point of view
So there's a lot of controversy going on regarding the idea of a silver squeeze. After what happened with gamestop, I'm convinced that this shit really might work out. On the other hand there are a lot of people thinking that this is just something to draw attention away from GME and withdraw fund from the stock. Let me assure you this is not my attention. And if you're all about GME I suggest reading here because it's a waste of time.  I personally think that slv really might be the next big thing that could work out. Therefore I'd suggest to not go against the idea generally. Keep your hands at gamestop as long as you want, but once work is done, get together into this next big thing.  \ \ Here's what happens or might happen:\ \ About the theory of the silversqueeze. Can't really be compared to the GME squeeze as it is not about squeezing out hedgefunds shortsellers in particular. The idea is that the silver price is priced way too low for the amount of silver that physically exists. The silvermarket volume on paper (exchanges/Futures..) is 250 times bigger than the supply of physical silver (just read this and didn't do my own DD if numbers are correct). The Idea is that a physical shortage will be caused and this would really let slv skyrocket with all that derivatives that are not backed. Now imagine some 7 million apes and the following retail investors that come after suddenly plunger the physical silver market...  Example: Let's assume there is a shortage and Person A wants physical delivery of the future he bought. Person B as the seller needs to deliver 5000 ounces of silver. If supply is short, the person buys another future from Person C in order to be able to deliver the slv needed. You understand the reaction this causes.  Also the silver market is said to be manipulated and kept low for a long time. I have no opinion on this.  \ \ What happened on the weekend?\ \ Silver already surged 20% since friday morning which was most likely a result of the news of "Wallstreetbets taking over silver" and "Shortage in silver supply".example:  Also social media generates a lot of heat.  So it look's like it's happening - if we're heading to a global shortage, prices could absolutely go to the moon and this is a big time chance to be with it at the beginning right now. Additionally there is a good chance that shortsellers have learnt from what was happening with GME and they might get out of their short positions earlier which will generate further momentum.    What you can do   in order to participate and make this work:It does not help the cause if you buy mining companys (even though it might generate good income). But still, in order moon the prices, you'll need to invest physically. The options are:\  Buying silver futures and let it physically deliver. Only possible if you can easily invest some 150k.\  Buying slv or pslv if you live at the hamburgers, and for instance "Xtrackers physical silber" if you're from Europe. It's really important that you check if the fund needs to fully physically cover it's assets (=buy silver). Because not all do so.\  The next option is to physically buy silver at your local store or webshop.\  At last, you can buy options. Your counterpart might want to hedge the positions and therefore will potentially be covered. This is also obviously the part where you can win big time (or lose everything). My weapon of choice is:    expiring in April  I prefer a mix of above.  But as we all know, I'm just another ape sharing brainfarts, hence I'm definitely not in the position to give financial advice. Also I'm long on slv, silver options and bought the silver of some local shops.  TL;DR:This post is   NOT about GME  . No selly selly - I get the hype! But silver might be one of the best chances for the upcoming weeks I believe. And today it's still a chance to get in early at low prices.  e/okay, guess we have to wait until GME is through. Looks like most in here aren't open for a new relationsship. Anything that's not GME/AMC gets downvoted to hell. ITT: People with weak hands scared of any funds going from gme to slv - this is ridiculous.    e2/ Thx for gold, even though silver would have done it!

Hedge Funds Abuses: Anatomy Of A Short Attack (2 Articles)
Here are 2 articles on how hedge funds abuse shorting.  Short explanation:    >Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  - >The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  - >When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.  - Long explanation:    >Illegal naked shorting and stock manipulation are two of Wall Street's deep, dark secrets. These practices have been around for decades and have resulted in trillions of dollars being fleeced from the American public by Wall Street. In the process, many emerging companies have been put out of business. This report will explain the magnitude of this problem, how it happens, why it has been covered up and how short sellers attack a company. It will also show how all of the participants; the short hedge funds, the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)‚Äîmake unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated.  - >Why is This Important? This problem affects the investing public. Whether invested directly in the stock market or in mutual funds, IRAs, retirement or pension plans that hold stock ‚Äî it touches the majority of Americans.  (...)  - >The participants in this fraud, which, when fully exposed, will make Enron look like child's play, have been very successful in maintaining a veil of secrecy and impenetrability. Congress and the SEC have unknowingly (?) helped keep the closet door closed. The public rarely knows when its pocket is being picked as unexplained drops in stock price get chalked up to ‚Äúmarket forces‚Äù when they are often market manipulations.  - >The stocks most frequently targeted are those of emerging companies who went to the stock market to raise start‚Äìup capital. Small business brings the vast majority of innovative new ideas and products to market and creates the majority of new jobs in the United States. It is estimated that over 1000 of these emerging companies have been put into bankruptcy or had their stock driven to pennies by predatory short sellers.  - >It is important to understand that selling a stock short is not an investment in American enterprise. A short seller makes money when the stock price goes down and that money comes solely from investors who have purchased the company's stock. A successful short manipulation takes money from investment in American enterprise and diverts it to feed Wall Street's insatiable greed‚Äîthe company that was attacked is worse off and the investing public has lost money. Frequently this profit is diverted to off‚Äìshore tax havens and no taxes are paid. This national disgrace is a parasite on the greatest capital market in the world.  - >  Who are the Participants in the Fraud?    - >  The participants subscribe to the theory that it is much easier to make money tearing companies down than making money building them up, and they fall into two general categories: 1) They participate in the process of producing the counterfeit shares that are the currency of the fraud and/or 2) they actively short and tear companies down.    - >  The counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting.

Evidence of Massive Naked Short Selling Fraud in GME and AMC
First of all, major credit to u/johnnydaggers for the   If you haven't read that yet, go take a look.  Inspired by his analysis, I wanted to investigate the SEC's publicly available Failed to Deliver data and see how it compared to other companies over time.  I wrote some code to process the the raw SEC data and normalize the shares that failed to deliver by the total number of outstanding shares of the company. This gives us a view that where each company's FTD shares are expressed as a percentage of the outstanding, so we can fairly compare companies to one another.  (Before you ask, yes I account for fluctuating values of outstanding shares.)  I went back to the beginning of 2019, looking at a few of the recent meme stocks with short squeezes as well as the top 10 (by weight) in the S&P 500 as well as GE (as an example of a stock with very low short interest). Here's what I found.     Shares can fail to deliver for many reasons, but when large numbers of shares fail to deliver a likely explanation is naked short selling. For a thorough explanation of this, see  .  Back in early 2019, both GME and AMC look like the others. All had sub-1% of their outstanding shares end up as FTD. But starting in mid 2019, both GME and AMC experienced three waves of progressively larger naked short selling attacks. This is known as  .  I wanted to see if I could find corroborating evidence of news and price data which aligned in time with these waves of naked shorting. What I found were two stories, both similar, explaining how GME and AMC got to where they are today.  # GameStop  The first wave (small bet) of naked shorts occurred in June and July of 2019. GME reported Q1 '19 earnings on June 4th after hours, with a  . Overall sales was down $ , net income plunged by 78%. This story is what formed the core of the bear thesis. The stock dropped 36% on the news.     But things changed when Q2 '19 earnings came around. Yes, sales were down again and the numbers didn't look good, but the company announced it was going to  . They were going to make their retail stores more efficient by closing some locations, focus on becoming a social hub for gaming, and build a digital platform around the relaunched GameStop website.  Investors liked the news and the stock tries to move upwards, but is repeatedly beaten down. This lines up with the second wave of naked shorting. The original short sellers couldn't let the price float up, so they resorted to more than doubling down on their original naked short bet to keep the stock trending downward.     Finally COVID hits the US in March and April. Lockdowns happen and it becomes clear that nobody is going to malls anytime soon. This is where the third and final massive wave of naked short selling happens, attempting to push GME into bankruptcy. Remember, that's always the goal with naked short selling. If the company goes bankrupt, especially with a convenient parallel story ("It was a failing company anyway and COVID was the nail in the coffin!"), then nobody bothers to look into how many counterfeit shares might be floating around out there. They aren't worth anything, so who cares!  At its peak,   over 20% of the company's entire outstanding shares were failing to deliver every month  . This is confirmed by a tweet from Michael Burry (since deleted, he scrubs his tweets) that says when he tried to recall his lent-out shares, it took his broker   many weeks   to locate them. Remember, companies normally have well below 1% of their outstanding shares fail to deliver every month.  # AMC Entertainment  To understand how we got here with AMC, you need to look back further, to 2017. AMC has been struggling to be profitable for a while. They had a history of posting very small net profits along with many net losses. Their cash on hand was hovering around $300M and their corporate borrowing had been going up.        What coincided with the first small naked short bet on AMC in June/July of 2019? Their cash on hand just dipped below $200M (from being stable around $300m). The last time that happened, AMC more than doubled its corporate loans. The short hedge funds smelled blood in the water.  The second bet, where the naked shorts doubled down occurred in November of 2019. What happened then? AMC Q3 earnings, which showed that cash on hand had dropped to a precipitous $100M. Bankruptcy was in sight for the hedge funds...  And then COVID hit. Their massive third wave bet was similar to GameStop, though slightly more delayed. Why? May 2020 was the peak of naked short selling, around the time when some businesses were able to reopen with restrictions, but it was clear that   movie theaters  , among a few other things, would be staying closed until the pandemic was completely over.  Also like GameStop, at its peak   over 20% of the company's outstanding shares were failing to deliver  . This is not normal.  # Conclusion  I think the evidence shows there is a strong reason to believe that one or more hedge funds, probably in collusion with broker dealers or the DTCC, have been deliberately naked short selling both GME and AMC since mid-2019. They made small bets to start with in the first wave, doubled down a few months later, but stupidly went all-in for the kill when COVID hit the US. It presented a unique scapegoat that nobody would question for pushing a failing mall retailer and a dwindling movie chain out of business.  Where does this leave us? I don't know. Unless this results in some kind of economic crisis (and I'm beginning to think it will), I don't see anything getting seriously investigated or changing. This is the same crap that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, but nobody was went to jail for it. Of course they were going to keep doing it.    This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and paste.    Positions: 100 GME @ $36, 500 AMC @ $  (but I wrote $3 calls before it mooned... GUH)  If anyone wants to play around with the code or data I used to generate the first plot (monthly normalized failure to deliver data),  .

PSA: RH set a new $5k maximum for limit sell orders on GME - place new ones if yours were above that.
$5000 is the new max for limit sells on Robin Hood (from what I'm seeing here on my end but YMMV), so if you had any orders set at that price or above, set new ones if you need them. All the jokes about "I'm not selling until $69,420!    " are hilarious and all, but if your exit strategy involves trying to take profits on the way up (the idea of which here is also hilarious bc   üëäüëä - fuck the   s), then make sure you're still set up how you need to be.  edit - not financial advice, etc. Me ü¶ß, not monkey suit working at    fund.  edit 2 - My first award!

Things to remember on Monday if you hold GME stock
# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand  They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.  # Expect some crazy volatility  Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).  # Manage your risk  I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.  The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.  # Be a critical thinker, do your DD  There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say "see, they didn't know what they were doing". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.  Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver.   # BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.  Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.     TLDR:  DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.  HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.  BEWARE OF SILVER.  For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.  Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.  Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.  Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules. Nothing else.

$GME Caution (actually just Gay Bear) reporting in with some DD
TLDR: "CoNtrARiaN" but actually just a dick-eating bear thesis that the SQUEEZE has in fact, been ALREADY SQUOZE.    _Let me preface that for all the 5M newbies to this sub, I am saddened that my favorite sub since 2017 has been invaded by normies. But at the same time, I am excited for all the new amount of fodder (yeah, you) for memes. So WELCOME TO THE GANG, GANG &lt;3_      THESIS: The big short squeeze has already happened.        When?    Approximately from the when our lord and savior Burry probably cashed out (sometime before his settlement date for 13-F filing coming out in 2 weeks time) to when the news broke and Cramer shat his pants on CNBC last Monday.      Why do you think this?    First, MELVIN was NOT the ONLY ones SHORT, they were just the slowest ones to cover (and hence probably will continue to be the poster-child for bukkake gang-rape by millennials and zoomers with stimmy checks).  Second, GME literally went from $5 per share to $37 per share by January 15, 2021, the settlement date for the latest short float update (I‚Äôll come back to your fucking daily updates from S3 Partners and Ortex later on, and why I don‚Äôt trust them).  To put it into perspective for these unscrupulous, criminal, BIG money positions on the short-side that have been here a LOOOONG time, that‚Äôs already a 750% loss.  If someone had put in   JUST   $1M in August 2020 (by the way, the short float % was around 99% at this time, so I KNOW more got in short after this) hoping for a Gamestop bankruptcy, by Jan 15, 2021 these fuckers would have lost $8M in total (initiating position would have been about 200K shares short, by the time it gets to 1/15/2021, $37 x 200K shares =¬† $   So, by wagering $1M on the short side, you now have to buy back and return your shares. You now have a $  loss.    WELL THAT FUCKING SUCKS? Right? Well then what does a 400-IQ, uncircumcized-dick hedgie with a wedgie want to do about this situation? They GOTTA make that loss back SOMEWAY SOMEHOW.    You could suck trucker dick or deal drugs, but these white-collar yuppies have enough power to NOT have to stoop down to that level.      Here is how they CAN, and probably ARE, doing it right now:    Melvin wasn‚Äôt the only short position. Just the most retarded one that didn‚Äôt cover in time, so they had to go through a whole fucking liquidity crisis, class action lawsuit, and dick-eating meme-fest while literally asking for sugar-daddy money. What about the less retarded short positions? Well, they probably have some losses too, because I mean, they did get squeezed in the earlier portion of the play, but now they have sights on something else.    First, your hedgies (excluding Melvin & Citron) continue to push the narrative: ‚ÄúThrow Melvin & Citron to the masses and keep the retail investors coming in with their diamond hands and high school diplomas.‚Äù    Second,   hedgies go LONG on GME shares now  . WTF HOW? Well remember that for short positions, there are LENDERS of these shares. These lenders would happily let go of their positions at the ‚Äútop‚Äù of a squeeze. (It‚Äôs ez fucking profit, and they want none of this mess).  Third, you now have a long position with underlying shares. What‚Äôs the best play here? You fucking write call options because the vol premiums are literally mooning at the moment. And I‚Äôve been on WSB long enough to know that WSB‚Äôs risk management is literally just selling one-paired organ to afford the option premium on FDs.  Lastly, you push the narrative of a ‚ÄúGAMMA SQUEEZE‚Äù which is JUST a little bit too hard for your average joe from Mississippi to understand with his Algebra 2 from high school ‚Äì Essentially telling him, ‚ÄúHEY THERES STILL MORE TO SQUEEEEEZE.‚Äù  ¬†      REAL Gs MOVE IN SILENCE:    Look at the volumes, the float rotation in the past week for GME is already enough to have fucked virgins 20 times and sacrificed them to capitalist gods.   Which means for hedgies with wedgies, it‚Äôs no longer a tail-risk, blind-side event, it‚Äôs time to REAP the souls of every stimmy check fool, by ‚ÄúMaRkET MAkInG‚Äù.  If I am that Hedgie, I write call options, while maintaining a fa√ßade that I will ‚Äúrationally‚Äù hedge those positions by buying more of the underlying shares. FUN FACT: I already have them.  You stimmy check tards will keep buying into GME, because you heard about it in the news over the weekend and want to get in on this action to ‚ÄúSTICK IT TO THE MAN‚Äù because 2020 has been an absolute suicidal descent into madness because of COVID. You will probably go on for a couple more days this upcoming week, now that liquidity restrictions are slowly being lifted on trading platforms.  SO, while you fools supply buying volume, all I have to do is collect my premiums on option sales, while slowly unwinding my underlying share positions, and thereby also managing risk of option assignment since I‚Äôll sell shares into every spike and swerve the price away from the strike price of YOUR options.  And I‚Äôll also have an expectation as to where GME could potentially rise to. You just look at the WSB subscriber count, multiply that by the avg retail trader account liquidity.  You guys will think you have stuck it to the man, but the man is sticking your wife ALREADY, ever since the moment you got angry and emotional about an opportunity to unleash your pent up hatred towards the Wall Street system. All I am saying is, for every tard like Melvin, there‚Äôs 20 other hedgies out there to fuck you up without you even realizing it. After all it‚Äôs done, they‚Äôll even make you feel bad, saying you were ‚ÄúGreedy‚Äù and ‚ÄúReckless‚Äù, further perpetuating emotional volatility in markets that they will keep profiting off of.  So while the retail GME HODLER thinks there‚Äôs still enough gold raining from the top of midtown Manhattan, all they‚Äôre getting is piss and pre-cum.  ¬†      APPENDIX ‚Äì Ortex & S3 Partners    If you got all the way through until now, I apologize for my lack of presentation in this thesis, it‚Äôs literally 3AM in the East Coast US because I‚Äôm up for 4AM pre-market (don‚Äôt fucking judge me, I‚Äôm a retard too).  So I‚Äôll explain that point from WAY up there about short interest estimates.  I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck what Ortex and S3 Partners says. I do NOT believe that short float is STILL above %100 after the official data came out on 1/27 with a lag of two fucking weeks from its settlement date on 1/15. The stock price moved so egregiously that every autist in Manhattan would have literally gone bankrupt if they‚Äôre still short, NOT just Melvin.  See, here‚Äôs the thing. If the system is ALREADY built with this   two weeks lag   on short data for individual stocks, what fucking data analytics company in their right mind would NOT try to take advantage of this time & information arbitrage? The system is FUCKED, but it gets perpetuated because the ones perpetuating this have the MOST to gain.  Ortex and S3 Partners is purely a marketing ploy, they hopped on this gravy train to get your subcriptions and some more clicky-clicks on their website traffic so they can use those metrics to raise some more funds later on.  And even if they believed in your cause, no smart data analytics firm would willingly give up that information arbitrage to the public, if they want to ever think about doing business with ANY hedge-fund in town.  Therefore, I am sticking to my autistic thought that the system is stacked (which most of you agree) against us. BUT, I urge you to be a little bit more careful, because short float data can be misleading at best and a total fraudulent bull-trap at worst.   Again, If you are new here, welcome to the gang. This sub will always be about losing money and becoming best friends with your wife‚Äôs boyfriend. But over time, it will be about the friends and knowledge you gained along the way.  ¬†      Thank you for listening to my ted-talk. I expect a PHD tag for my 8-inch dick.

A view on silver and why it's shit - "Fuck you" edition
Full disclosure: I am not a financial advisor and this is based purely on my observations and speculation. I'm a pants-on-head wearing retard and have possibly missed key points that would contradict my statements. Invest at your own risk.      And yes, I own GME.    \                          -  As we've been seeing this weekend, multiple bots have been hard pushing silver. At almost exactly the same time as this happened (EOD Friday) it was announced that SLV and futures were rising rapidly due to the 'Reddit mob' even though the vast majority of retail has no way to trade on weekends or touch futures.  This is obviously because no one has jumped on silver. Or at least not retail. The banks sure do love silver, and so do the boys at Shitadel. Shitadel is the fifth largest holder, along with several large banks.    Their strategy is probably something like this:    They are running out of ammunition and their investors are scared. They love to hedge with commodities, and because they and their investors are scared now is the time to stock up. They've bought out most major suppliers and at the same time pushed the narrative that it was done by Reddit. Why?  Because they don't want people to know they're scared. They don't want people to know they are losing and buying commodities. This is their hedge, this is their attempt to cover their losses. They want to stock up on silver, but when they do that in large numbers the tickers and futures will spike. How do they explain that without giving away their position? "Reddit did it."  After they cause silver to spike in a meaningful way, they need someone to sell it off to. They've artificially created demand for silver and prevented suppliers from being able to sell to retail, and now it's trending on social media and boomer media. So what's the next step? How will they sell? Later on, they will push the silver narrative once more even harder, blaming Reddit for trying to collapse the dollar (because let's be real we fucking love clout) and all of the suppliers will suddenly have large amounts of silver available again for Reddit to get their hands on.  They want to egg you on, show you the proof by raising silver prices, and then sell it to you and line their pockets with your cash. Artificially raising the price and then selling it off the moment they can. There's a phrase for this but I think it keeps getting my posts removed.  Anyone you see pushing SLV, AG, and physical silver is either heavily misinformed, a(u)(r)tistic beyond all belief, or paid off by a bank.  Yes, silver is heavily shorted. No, Reddit will not win a commodity war. Banks control actual physical supply lines, not just paper shares. There is no beating them at this game. People have tried and all but disappeared for it, multiple times.  If you want to ride their rise of silver then by all means go for it, but be aware that it is not retail investors causing this to rise. It is likely the people that need more ammo for this next week: Banks and HFs.  \          -       G M  E   TL;DR  Banks are blaming a spike in silver futures on Reddit to hide their own hedging, and are shilling silver here so that when it becomes available for purchase retail will pay a premium to 'get in' on a short that doesn't exist. Retail lines their pockets with money, and they get to empty their mansions of all the silver they hoarded.

My Hot Take on the Influence Citadel has over what Collateral Prices the DTCC/NSCC Sets
Elon Musk laid an epic smackdown to Citadel while grilling Vlad the Stock Impaler from Robinhood in the clubhouse stream that just went down. So I got curious and looked up the nscc, here's one random thing that came up.       TLDR for the Article: Citadel has a huge dong so the NSCC better do what they want.  I'd be willing to bet they can swing their dong around to influence how much cash the NSCC gets to basically make up whenever they want. So Robinhood usually needs 50-300million on hand, NSCC says nah bro now you need 3 billion unless you shut that shit down.

Dear Fidelity Investments
Just wanted to say you are my favorite broker and it's been tough sending you business once you turned off fractionals for GameStop and possibly other shares. I think it's pretty weak if that was your decision to do so.  There's a lot of people flooding to your business and your mobile app now because of this subreddit. Even though the UI for your mobile app is pretty bad compared to ROBEMGOOD.  As a suggestion could you possibly open fractional investing up for people with the minimum deposit required to open an account with you? $100. Or maybe allocate a little of your large amount of shares for these retail investors?  There's a lot of people who would like to buy fractional shares in these companies you turned off and they have the right to do so. You were offering this option before. When everything went down and people couldn't buy shares you turned that option off.  If there's a reason these retail investors can't buy fractional shares, can you at least release an announcement as to why that is? And don't bullshit us?  If you have already turned the option back on, please disregard. With your Quick Ticket system that you have to use in order to buy fractional shares, you can't place an order until market opens.  So I haven't been able to check since Friday and it was still off.   Here's an article from Reuters you posted that says ROBEMGOOD still isn't offering fractional shares.  Neither was Fidelity last I checked even though I tested it prior to the whole fiasco and it worked.      Disclaimer: Not an advisor just think it's kind of shitty to turn off an option for investors with smaller amounts of capitol, unless you were forced by regulators to do so.  Then it's the regulators who are shitty. Unless there is no more actual shares to buy and that doesn't seem to be the case. What's going on with that?

Biotron Limited (ASX: BIT) tied to production of Covid vaccine
Moderna is negotiating a deal with Biotron which would see them lease their faculties to produce covid vaccines. In February 2020 BIT spiked 200% per speculation they would begin research into a covid vaccine which they never did. I strongly believe this news of a deal being made between BIT and Moderna could cause a massive spike in BIT as it is only $  right now the sky‚Äôs the limit. This literally cannot go tits up.

GME Discussion Thread for February 01, 2021
A message from a fallen soldier
Hello guys  I just wanted to say how blown away I am by what's happening. Last year, I was heavily invested (most of my portfolio, not smart I know) in GNUS which ended up getting fucked by and over-shorted by Citron resulting in heavy losses. I was doing very well trading until that point which probably gave me the confidence to commit that much capital. I was forced to pull back from trading because I couldn't sustain the loss. I'm 22 with a tax bill and a business that's on hold due to covid so I can only take so many losses. Another year, another opportunity for a bounce-back hopefully.  I genuinely believed in the company and went long but then Citron came along and created a shitstorm of bad PR and almost got the company delisted essentially with how far they forced the price down. I remember seeing teachers, firemen, and just regular people who put their life savings get burned badly by these institutions for absolutely no reason.  They tried to do the same with GameStop but you guys didn't let it happen. This genuinely makes me so fucking proud and brings tears to my eyes.  I'm playing a part in this movement by trying to educate as many people around as possible on the situation, explaining what's going on, where to buy GME and why these institutions deserve the punishment they're getting. It's working!!! Excited to be back in the game once I hopefully get the business up and running after covid.  Keep strong ladies and gents <3

2008 VW Short Squeeze Breakdown published 2018. Interesting similarity‚Äôs
The VW infinity squeeze seemed entirely counter intuitive at the time.  And that is exactly the point.  All infinity squeezes are the result of heavy over-shorting of shares which then become difficult or impossible to cover.  Such aggressive over-shorting only occurs when the bear thesis against the fundamentals is conclusively strong and very well disseminated. In other words, stocks which appear to be the ‚Äúbest short ideas‚Äù are also the ones which often end up being most likely to see the most violent short squeezes.     published December 2018.
GME: Evidence of Short Seller Collusion (for Months) and an Explanation for Why Short Estimates are Probably Way Off!
MODS: THIS IS IMPORTANT, PLEASE DON'T REMOVE  So far, many of you have seen and heard about the ladder attacks that have been happening with GME recently. What if I tell you that "short interest is going down" is the result of shorts unwinding their previous ladder attacks?  Let me explain:  Today, I saw something very strange on Webull. I saw shares of GME being traded in L2 data for \~$14, \~20$, and around \~$30. I managed to take a screenshot from one of these sales and in order to make sure that something is very wrong, I made a limit buy order at $30 before it happened again. The order obviously didn't get filled:      Processing img lmjh2m5bn0f61...   At first, I thought this might be a glitch, but after thinking about it more, it clicked! I've been following GME for months, the key is within why these prices were chosen ($14, $20, $30)! Folks who've been following GME closely know that GME broke $14 for the first time after the Microsoft deal. Both $20 and $30 were also important breakthroughs for GME's price.  So why are we seeing these prices again today? I have a theory! Short sellers were having ladder attacks back then, but the way they probably did them was the following:  Let's say hedgefund A and hedgefund B are colluding to bring the price down. Since there are no shares available to borrow, A buys 1000 shares and lends them to B. B then shorts those shares but makes sure that A is the one buying them. A lends these shares to B again and B shorts them again. This continues until the price gets down to the desired level. This artificially increases the short interest of GME, but in reality, only 1000 shares have been changing hands. If you look carefully, you see these shares that are being traded in the above screenshot have slightly different prices.  Here is the thing: these short-sellers are probably unwinding the previous ladder attacks now to reduce the artificial short interest they have previously created! The fact that there are not many shares to borrow even though short interest "in theory" seems to be going down also proves this! I'm baffled by how dumb these short sellers are to actually use the prices that they used to create those ladder attacks! They are not even trying to hide their tracks at this point!  Now you might ask "what if all of the short interest is artificial?", the answer is an obvious no! Why do you ask? because if they didn't have massive short positions, they wouldn't have to do these ladder attacks, to begin with!  How do I know (or rather guess) that the actual short interest hasn't gone down by a lot? 2 reasons:  1. The stock is still hard to borrow in almost all brokerages (AFAIK) 2. The following screenshot shows that there are only   of all the outstanding shares have been bought at a higher price than today's closing price, which would be around    shares:     As you know, today's closing price was a lower price than the price of almost all trades that happened today and Friday, which means one thing: There are AT MOST   shares left in the float and all that is happening is that they are just changing hands! So the short interest AT MOST has gone down by ( \     in the past two days (unless the folks who have lent these shares out have sold them immediately after they received them, which seems unlikely to me since I haven't seen any SEC filings from institutions)!  What I do not know is this: do these short-sellers report these artificial short interests in their official report of "short selling" or not! My guess is that they don't, because:  1. They are probably scared of getting caught!  2. Another reason why I think these artificial short sales are not included in the official short interest numbers is that short interest estimates for GME has always been off and this can explain why this has been the case (when they are using these type of ladder attack, the estimates are probably higher than reality, and when they are unwinding them the estimates are probably lower).  3. I think it is also very likely that they are unwinding these positions now to cover their tracks!  Also, note that shorts don't have to "borrow and sell" to each other to create a ladder, they can just "buy and sell" from each other. However, I think they've done this to intentionally mess with the short interest estimates!  Based on this evidence, I believe that the squeeze has not squoze! This also suggests that short-sellers have been committing crimes for a while now in my opinion since this type of collusion is obviously illegal!    Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and this is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares.    Hopefully, SEC will take a close look at what these short-sellers are doing, but given that it seems like this has been going on for a while, I doubt that anyone will do anything about this!
Straight from the horse's mouth. I'm pretty sure this should all sound familiar enough to everyone here
I know it's been a wild year so far for everyone here, but strap in an make sure to take your adderall tonight you ADHD having fucks. This was published in 2003... Post 9/11, Pre-Iraq  , and sure as shit, pre-GFC. A quick quote for context:  The SEC demands to know every time an issuer issues registered shares and the issuer needs your blessing. Does not a shareholder or a company's management have the right to know every time the DTCC illegally issues unregistered shares without an exemption or your permission? Should an investor file a 13-d when he reaches 5% ownership of the issued # of shares of a company or 5% of the total amount of shares, real and fake, at the DTCC? Does a person become an affiliate or "control" person when he owns 10% of the issued shares of a public corporation or 10% of the total shares represented as being owned on monthly brokerage statements to shareholders? Which # does Rule 16 (a) refer to? Should every person ever fined for 13 d or 16a violations appeal these fines, look at the # of "counterfeit" shares in existence at the DTCC at the time of the alleged violation, and recalculate what % of the TOTAL # of shares, real and fake, he really did have control of?  All one has to do is go through the '34 Exchange Act, rule by rule and regulation by regulation, to see how undermined these securities laws really are when unregistered, unrestricted, dividend lacking, vote missing, and basically nonexistent "pseudo-shares" fill the computer banks at the DTCC as well as the monthly brokerage statements of investors who THOUGHT they had bought real "packages of rights" (shares) in a public corporation. People that think that they own 1% of the shares of a public corporation may only own one-fourth of that and the one-fourth of 1% ownership share is of a greatly damaged company and not the company that was "advertised".   I'm going to bed, see you fucks on the other side

So You're Experiencing FUD
Well what the hell, retard. What have we been telling you literally this whole time?     . Its that fucking simple. What is so hard to understand about that?  Oh right, you're an illiterate  . Whatever, let me help you out.  # Common lil bitch questions:    Q: I'm seeing red in my account ohmygodwhatishappening      A:   Holy ùíªùìäùí∏ùìÄ. We've explained this before. Your brain must be polished all nice and shiny. Let me help you out.  Firstly, we've got to explain the basics. What happens when a stock price goes down? Well, that means that there are more sellers than buyers. That should be obvious. A larger supply and less demand means that the value of the product in question goes down until supply and demand balance out.  Now that you understand what's been driving economies since the first hairless    decided to trade a mango for a handy, take a look at   Do you see a large supply? No? That's right, you cute little drooling potato. All of you    absolute CHADS out there, you're doing great. Keep it up sweethearts. Nobody is selling.  So then why is price going down? Well, there's this thing called a short ladder attack.    Q: That sounds complicated! What's a sho-    shut the fuck up and let me finish. Don't interrupt me again or I'm gonna give DFV's address to your wife, and we'll see how long she stays with you.  A short ladder attack is when two big whales (read: Melvin and his wife's boyfriend) sell stocks to each other, rapidly, at decreasing values. Remember when I told you about supply and demand? This is an artificial inflation of supply without demand increasing along with it. What does that do to the price? It drops it.  Short ladder attacks are not effective in one of two situations. Either there's a third whale (the guy that fucks Melvin's boyfriend - I know this a complicated love triangle but keep up) who matches the artificial supply with their demand, and they buy up the short ladder attacks. Or, there's too much volume in the stock, and the tiny dick plays being done by Melvin and his wife's boyfriend isn't increasing the supply for the stock in any meaningful way. We actually have seen examples of both.  First off, on   that were happening. You see what happened right after the lockout? Volume stayed high as people bought the dip - but then, almost like magic, as the volume flatlined, the decent to Thursday's closing price of $197 began. People weren't selling, but Melvin's short ladder attacks became very effective as Robinhood users suddenly couldn't match the demand of the previous hours. Melvin's short ladder attacks went from a very small volume in comparison to real trades, to very large volume in comparison to real trades, and we've been seeing this ever since.  Secondly, remember how I mentioned a short ladder attack can be countered by a third whale buying to match the increased artificial supply? We saw this on Friday, as we fought to hold levels above $320. We were expecting a massive short ladder attack right before market close, and we got it - but a whale jumped in and gobbled up every single share that Melvin and his wife's boyfriend put up for sale.   Melvin definitely trying some    shit, but the aforementioned whale kept us above water.  You can speak now.    Q: Okay, so I get what short ladder attacks are, and I see how they're affecting the price. But what's to stop    Melvin from doing this until the price hits $0?    That's actually a great question! There's 3 factors at play here that prevent this from happening.  Firstly retail investors buying. This provides a small, but steady pushback against the short ladder attacks. Its like a guy falling from the sky. Without retail investors (the parachute) he goes into an utter free fall and fucking dies. With retail investors (again, the parachute), that decent isn't stopped, but its slowed.   Its important to note that retail investor buy pressure would normally outweigh the short ladder attacks, but Robinhood's limitations are stopping too many from buying  . Hopefully we'll see the buy pressure from retail increase as people are able to swap cash over from their Robinhood account to Fidelity/Vanguard, but for now, there's still lots of people stuck in limbo (cash is still in the transfer phase). This pressure will be released like a fat nut after blue balling for 6 hours if Robinhood allows unlimited buying again, but we shouldn't count on that. Its important to note (I actually highlighted this on the Friday chart on the dip) that you beautiful, gorgeous autists aren't selling, but rather buying the dips. We can see proof of that via lack of volume during price free falls, and then an increase in volume as people buy the fucking dip. If you're ever worried about your fellow autists selling, just pay attention to volume. It'll tell you everything you need to know.  Secondly, whales buying. Again, I touched on this talking about Kjetille Stjerne on Friday, but the fact of the matter is that in these tiny volume situations, large buys from whales can affect the price. And I mean REALLY affect the price. At this point, I think a single buy from someone like RC or daddy Elon could launch it high enough to begin a short squeeze. The volume is just too small for Melvin to prevent it. u/jn_ku has some fantastic analysis on this whole situation posted on investing (sit the fuck down WSB puritans, its good stuff).  I'd highly encourage each and every one of you to check it out, but the take away that I want to point to is his analysis on volatility. As total shares available and total shares being traded (read: volume) are lowered, buys and sells affect the price more. And fear not - we have whales who have yet to play their hand on our side. RC for example could scoop up a fuckton of shares any day, if he weren't worried about the SEC coming after him for market manipulation (ironic, huh? Fuck you right in the ass SEC).  Thirdly, Melvin and his    gang can't just scoop up shares to cover their shorts after they ladder attack the price down. The whole point of a ladder attack is to artificially inject supply, to make people panic and sell, which will inject real supply, which they can then buy to cover their shorts. If people diamond hand, and no one sells, no matter how low the price gets, no real supply will ever be injected into the market and they'll never be able to cover. You see GME's price going down and down because Melvin and his cronies   exclusively   are selling. Nobody else. Melvin can't buy shares from themselves, and they buying shares from the people shorting and ladder attacking with them doesn't actually decrease the total amount of shorted shares at all, since they're buying a share to cover a short but taking a share that could cover a short at the same time.   No matter how fucking low the price gets, $100, $50, $1, they can't cover if you have the balls to     . You may be asking, what if they buy calls and let the price recover after a short ladder attack to cover via exercising the calls without actually ever buying from market? Well, where the fuck do you think the sellers of those calls get those shares from? They have to buy from market too, which is just them passing the heaping pile of shit they're currently holding to the poor fucks who have to cover those calls. Either way, a short squeeze happens.  You're doing a good job at not interrupting me. I might let you hold my balls tonight while I fuck your wife silly.    Q: Okay, so short ladder attacks are ineffective as long as nobody sells. But what if people are going to sell when it gets too low?! Aren't they scared like me?!    I'd trust you     with my life right now. That's how retarded I am. But you're a little pussy bitch reading this because you need some pure, raw, uncut hopium. Its okay, at some point we all hit that alluring drug. Regardless of my level of trust for you retards however, why don't you go and see for yourself if people are buying? Go to whatever trading chart site you feel has enough crayons to satisfy your insatiable appetite and look at volume on dips and subsequent rallies.   Nobody is fucking selling  .   Not even on Thursday, when we experienced the most blatant market manipulation I've ever seen and a drop of over $300 in the span of just over 1 hour.   Really, go take a look. I've taught you how to look for when people are selling and when people are buying, and when its just a ladder attack via the volume. Don't take my word for it, go look for yourself. And try not to eat all the crayons on your way there. Or, at least, save the blueberry ones for me. Fuck, I love the blueberry flavor.    Q: So if ladder attacks won't work no matter how low the price gets as long as us    , then why is short interest being reported as less and less every day?    First of all, I didn't give you permission to speak. But I'll let it pass because you've been a good retard and that's a good question.  You could attribute it all to media manipulation and fake news, and you may very well be right. We won't know until FINRA short interest is reported in just over a week. But who knows, there's a huge probability hedge funds will lie on their report to FINRA (after all, it is only a measly fine). So I propose we ignore all reports right now and instead look at the facts:  \- Hedge funds couldn't have covered with shares given the volume over the past week. Its mathematically impossible.  \- If hedge funds try to short ladder attack the price to obscenely low levels and you silverback     , then they'll try covering via large call option purchases - but again, this doesn't prevent a short squeeze, only pass the buck.  What else can they do? Well, not anything else to cover - but they can hide the true short interest through a whole fuckton of very illegal means. Keep in mind, this doesn't mean they're covering their shorts - it only means they're hiding their shorts.  Read   by u/DeeJay_Roomba. That's not a suggestion. It is seriously good DD backed by their sources.  Read it?    A: Yes.    Don't fucking lie to me. You just lost your ball holding privileges for tonight. Go read it, now.  They're fucking hiding in the grass. The punishment for all of this fraud and illegal manipulation is peanuts compared to the punishment of short squeeze, and this is how they're doing it. They haven't covered their short positions. The real short interest, which will be falsified on the FINRA report and is hidden by their scummy tactics, has been growing all along. Remember how, a week ago, some of you fucks were talking about how float short interest had risen above 140%? If the hedge funds are hiding their short positions this way - and keep in mind, again, there was no possible way for them to clear their short positions given your beautiful fucking   , so hidden short interest is the only logical explanation now - the short interest has risen. By a fucking lot. There's really no way to know the real number, but who knows? It could be 180%, it could be 240%, it could infinity%. One thing for sure though - short interest, if hidden in this manner, has gone up.  Yes, there are a few other ways of hiding short interest, and I'd love for people in the comments to explain it, but I'm too retarded to explain them myself. Forgive me DFV, for I've been naughty and haven't done enough illegal short hiding DD.  Any other questions?    A: No daddy   u/ssauronn.   You've answered all my questions. I now know why short ladder attacks are entirely ineffective as long as people   , and I know us fellow retards have already proven we'll    through drops nearing insanity, and I know how to check if retards are   . I also know why short sellers are trapped, utterly trapped, in their doggy position as long as we hold the fucking line. Thanks daddy. You can fuck my wife now. I'll just go play some minecraft until you're done.    That's a good retard.
GME from Germany with love, buy the dip
If I was a paperhand, I'd be worried. Too bad I got a smooth rockhard brain with hands of diamond.
Holding  The Line
Let's start actually reporting Melvin Capital to the SEC for blatant securities fraud. There's so much proof that it isn't even funny anymore.
If DFV is still holding, I'M STILL HOLDING
Some Motivation to Hold GME
I'm holding because I truly believe in the wealth gap in the USA. While teachers can struggle to make ends meet,  billionaires can go play golf on their "lunch" break and not worry about a dime. I really want to see this wealth transfer to the working class to see what they would do with it. Personally I would start up my own business. And I would hope many people would also take that opportunity. Just last week when the gains were going crazy, us redditors were going into our local communites and spreading the joy of giving. I believe that the more money the working class has access to, the better the economy. Soon, Walmart won't be owned by majority stakeholders and billionaires, no it will be the common people. (That's just a far fetched idea/example) But I hope you guys can understand what I'm trying to get at.   ELI5: Imagine a world where cooperations aren't owned by big banks, but rather the common folk. This is how we start the movement, by holding GME to expose Wall Street and allow everyday retail investors the equal opportunity.  Edit: I just like the idea of Hy-Vee and their employee owned business idea. Not owned entirely by the big man, but rather employees       Edit 2: I know this could all sound completely retarted, but that's what free speech is all about, to bounce ideas off each other and build deeper thoughts.
PLTR lock-up expiration and S-1 filing
Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I am just sharing what I have read all day today instead of working my day job. Please do your own research to confirm what I am going to say below.  Hey traders,  As Palantir's earnings is coming around the corner (estimated 2/11), their lock-up expiration will also come along at third trading session day after the ER, so estimated to be 2/14. And people who have been watching PLTR should be aware that the lock-up exp may be a huge negative catalyst as several ANALysts have been talking shit on the stock for potential unloading of 80% shares, crashing the stock price.  As a techie who has deep conviction in the company and its tech (browse the sub for plenty of DDs on company's outlook), I was confused when I saw  ? It got confusing so I decided to look into the s-1 filing specifically for the shares structure and forth.    NOTE  : This is my first time diving deep into a stock like this so   PLEASE   correct me if any part of this incorrect or too biased. I have tried my best to not skip any unclear terminology I faced along the way but in the end, I am not an analyst so I have limited knowledge.     #    As of   September 1st, 2020  , this was the total number of shares:     Ignoring/Including small figure RSUs, growth units, and exercisable options:  On first trading day back in September:    383,609,647 fully-diluted shares (including stock options) was available to trade   Registered additional 257,135,415 shares to be available to trade   Due to Investors‚Äô Rights Agreement, they "expected" up to 656,018,583 shares registered additionally to be available to trade   Total: Up to 1,296,763,645 fully-diluted shares (which seems accurate according to   free float)  On lock-up expiration day (estimated 2/14):    1,863,150,291 fully-diluted shares will be available to trade      From what I understand, registering shares allow them to be available to trade so we subtract 257,135,415 and 656,018,583 shares      Adjusted: 949,996,293 fully-diluted shares   Result: Total of 2,246,759,938 fully-diluted shares.      The figure above shows 2,173,481,929 fully-diluted shares. The math lines up considering additional RSUs, options could have been issued since September.   So the lock-up expiration doesn't free up   80%   of outstanding, but instead   42%  .     # Analysis on insider selling  As of   June 30, 2020  , this was how the shares were distributed:     Source:    All as of Feb 1, 2021, they sold the following shares:    Executives and directors:      Alexander Karp:   10,244,631 shares     Stephen Cohen:   5,133,000   shares   Shyam Sankar:   3,068,754   shares   Alexander Moore:   303,000   shares   Spencer Rascoff:   0   shares   Alexandra Schiff:   0   shares   Peter Thiel:   27,382,866   shares   David Glazer:   2,261,507   shares   Matthew Long:   848,811   shares   Ryan Taylor:   1,075,892   shares   TOTAL:   50,318,461   shares  None of the large shareholders/VCs/institutions sold! Also notice how bitch Soros is not even in the list! ü§£  The insider selling can be said to be pretty high in normal circumstances. But this can be explained in that since PLTR was a direct listing, they had to offload some shares, as well as register a lot of shares, so that the stock had liquidity (something Robinhood doesn't have ü§°). Also, not to mention the company has been around since 2003 so this may have been the first time for the big time insiders to cash out. (Note that these arguments can be seen as biased so take it with a grain of salt).     # What will happen on lockup expiration day?  I think the following will happen:       will sell   Some short sellers will come by for sure   Insiders will obviously sell some. But it's not going to be anywhere near the impact that  s are fearing.    Some key rumors:      Some insiders are looking to buy up shares -     Insiders already had chances to liquidate over the years -    I am personally planning to buy the dip if there is a big one, but I doubt the red will last long and the stock will go up onwards. I will be putting aside cash to buy the dip       TLDR; I think lock-up expiration won't mean shit to the stock and I am bullish    Positions: 200 shares of PLTR, 84 LEAPS of Jan 2022 $40 calls  Obligatory PLTR TO THE MOON    Edit 1: typo  Edit 2: included lock-up expiration date, which is third trading day from q4 2020 ER (estimated 2/11) so probably 2/14?

So you want to squeeze silver
Over the last several days there has been a mania regarding the decades old strategy that large institutions have inflicted on the price of silver. Finally, the little guy has gained awareness and has a chance to expose and potentially beat them at their own game. As a full time retail trader focusing in the metal markets I am familiar with the ‚Äúsupply issues‚Äù and the suppression of price of silver. The idea that if the demand for physical silver rose and caused a scarcity and therefore a forced demand of deliverables could in turn seriously crush the larger institutions that are net short is not new to me. I have been giving a lot of thought to the idea that many degens in this and other forums have expressed in attempting to squeeze the gay bears through heavy call flow on SLV and AG. I was incredulous to begin with as we all know how easily the hedgies can change the game on us smaller fish.  In a Eureka moment it dawned on me that instead of trying to take down the entirety of the Silver Shorters, there could be more of an affect if you concentrated on one specific area. This is where SLV comes into   tuned to the end as the plot thickens with even more manipulation at foot.  By now we have all heard of call buying gamma effects. Well, in SLV we have many key components that could cause the same effect that we saw in GME. The list is as follows:    $25 dominant options strike   The 25 strike relates to an area where major hedging by dealers needs to take place in order for them to   stay solvent in their SLV positions.   Hedge wall, where dealers are likely to change the way that they hedge, is currently sitting at $25   The key gamma strike, where most of the open interest that is related to gamma, is tied to $25   This indicates that at the $25 is where most of the dealer hedging needs to kick in.   The key delta strike, where most of the ITM strikes are,   guessed it $25   On top of these greeks, the top PUT OI and top CALL OI are at, yet again $25  We want to see the key gamma strike or hedge wall shift up high as this implies that dealers are buying at higher prices. Dealers are carrying a negative net gamma which means that they will get hurt as price moves up which causes them to buy more shares to keep up with their hedges. We currently have a much higher call volume than put volume as the 8/19/2021 EXP is   mil calls to 770k puts.     If SLV breaks under $25 you will see dealers begin to unwind there positions causing in influx of VOL. Moving forward (above $25) VOL is relatively low. This is due to the volume being distributed over a wide range of strikes. If there were to be a concentration of call buying at the $25 this will in turn increase the VOL above the $25 level.     If you want to see a Squeeze type move, we need to see an addition of call options at strikes >25 which would shift the momentum higher.     Here is where the plot thickens: As I was writing this I went to look at the AUG chain for SLV and noticed that it has disappeared across all platforms that I use. DO YOU THINK THAT THEY ARE FINALLY SCARED!!! Time will tell. The same effect could be accomplished by going one month out to the SEPT contracts or by buying shorter dated contracts and continuing to roll them until the dealers have drowned in that one position.  As with every disclaimer. This is not financial advice, and I wrote this as a research paper. Trade at your own risk and do your own research. Have fun and enjoy those tendies.   My position: nothing currently, watching 25 carefully as I said.
How To Avoid A FOMO Buy In 10 Steps
This checklist might save your day or at least save you some dollars.   You might think that you would never FOMO into a stock or you might be wondering if this applies to you. Ask yourself these questions to find out if you need the checklist.   - Have you ever thought of buying some super hyped shares at ATH?  - Have you thought about joining ‚Äòthe team‚Äô in the squeeze on stockthatshallnotbenamed? (Ps. there are no teams in retail investing it‚Äôs every man for himself)  - Do you use WallStreetBets?   If you answered yes to any of the precursor questions below then you are in danger of a FOMO trade and need this checklist.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ HOW NOT TO FOMO CHECKLIST  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  1. Ask yourself why you want to buy the stock. Are you jealous of others gains? Do you want to be part of that weeks big thing? If yes to either then do not buy. Jealous trading is bad trading.   2. Warren Buffet said ‚Äúbe greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.‚Äù Ask yourself if people are being greedy with the stock you want to buy, do not buy if they are.   3. Ask yourself ‚Äúam I being a sheep?‚Äù Sheep do not make money on the stock market, they don‚Äôt even understand the stock market, they are sheep. Don‚Äôt be a sheep.   4. Where did you see the stock? If it was on the news don‚Äôt buy it. If it‚Äôs trending on one of the subreddits then it‚Äôs probably too late.   5. Is it often appearing on the subreddit and being regularly pushed by the same small crowd? Watch out cause without proof they are probably bag holders hoping to pass the bag to you.   6. Can you explain to somebody what the company does and why it is a good idea to buy it? If not then you shouldn‚Äôt buy it yourself.   7. Is the market mostly red or mostly green that week? Sell on green weeks and buy on red weeks. It might feel like the other way around at the time but that‚Äôs emotional trading.  8. Is it a meme stock? If yes then be an early adopter or don‚Äôt adopt at all.   9. Have you got spare capital? If money is no issue to you or if you are making a small punt that won‚Äôt harm your finances then go ahead. If you are making a big, late move into a meme stock then you‚Äôll be seeing red.   10. Does it have emojis in the DD‚Äôs? If yes then disregard all previous steps and bet your house on it.
The loss porn better be epic.
Ya'll are gonna post it right? Seeing people YOLO 7 digits into the ultimate memestock movement has me fully erect for the loss porn. Ya'll better come through or my plumbs are gonna be salty AND blue. After inundating this sub with nonsense for the last week its the least you can do. I expect my loss porn. I demand my loss porn. Show me the red baby.     The only porn I'd rather see is Melvin's dumbass account. Morons shorting an already beaten down stock to the point that the internet could squeeze it 100x from march lows is pretty fucking amazing, I'll give you smoothbrains that.    The real winners in this are gonna be all the hedges/Whales that saw this shit hit 500 and borrowed every share they could get their hands on all the way down into the double digits. The fuckers are STILL shorting it and laughing all the way to the bank.   I'm going to bed, but I expect this will be downvoted into oblivion by morning. If you have the stones to do that, you should have the stones to Remindme! to come lick /u/pussysmith's meaty clackers when you baghold all the way down to December prices.

Madman Theory and $GME: The Biggest Game of Financial Chicken in History
Machiavelli once wrote that sometimes it is     With recent revelations of possible (if not likely) share counterfeiting, continued aggressive short ladder attacks, and increasing media distractions/disinfo, I have a theory I want WSB's input on.  # Short sellers are not just cheating at the game, they're scaring the referees into submission.  What we know:  1. Volume was incredibly low today, thanks to restrictions on platforms popular with retail investors (and good monkes holding). 2. Despite low volume, we saw ridiculous price drops as firms traded cash to ladder the price down. 3. Even with conservative/favorable estimates on short interest, HFs/MMs/Brokerages are still extremely exposed because... 4. There is a massive synthetic shares problem with no real way out, except continuously kicking the can down the road. As beautifully put by /u/forzan,      This all points to textbook      .    GME shorts have taken the financial system hostage, strapped it into the back seat, and are driving full-speed-ahead at retail investors in a massive game of chicken.  From what we've seen, hedgies are willfully doubling down on a terrible bet, to the point that it threatens to crash the market.  They know they lost the match, so their only option is to work the referees. My guess is that they're trying to fill the powder keg even more, and make the potential fallout so destructive, the SEC has no choice to step in and halt trading. Whatever fines or punishments are levied can't possibly be as bad as the alternative, which is an extinction event for multiple firms (HFs and brokerages).  # So how can the little  üêí respond?     You've got to convince them you're more irrational than they are.    This shouldn't be difficult for this group of shit-throwing apes.  From the Wikipedia article on brinkmanship:  > For brinkmanship to be effective, the sides continuously escalate their threats and actions. However, a threat is ineffective unless credible‚Äîat some point, an aggressive party may have to prove its commitment to action.   The hedge funds have already begun demonstrating the "credibility" of their threat as early as Wednesday last week. They're trying very hard to give the appearance that they are prepared to nuke everything if the refs don't cancel the match.  To win, retail investors have to show they're completely prepared to hold to $0.  TL;DR   ü§öüèº MONKE CRAZIER THAN YOU ARE

The US economy is a human body, and WSB is acting as the white blood cells
WSB is sticking it to the billionaire shortsellers and making them pay for crushing  companies into the dirt. The implications of this will be far reaching and, in the longrun, overwhelmingly positive.     If you think about predatory short-selling and it's effects on the economy, it is a practice that removes value from the our economic system. Imagine all the new companies that, if given a legitimate chance to grow, may have produced huge value for the entire economy. Imagine if Melvin Capital had been successful with Tesla in that regard? The effects of putting off the EV revolution and our general move away from fossil fuels could have been disastrous. Not to mention the fact that the Cybertruck is gonna be cool as fuck and the world would be a bit sadder without it. The damage they have done already is incalculable.      Enter WSB. Our system has produced a new type of cell: The WSB Autist. After having surviving the 2008 financial crisis we have evolved. With a "personal risk tolerance" of 100% and an imbred hate for hedgefunds, We were just waiting for our time.     Enter DFV. His grand autism showed us the path to avenging our parents, enriching ourselves, and fixing our broken financial systems all at once. Shortselling will never be carried out the same way ever again. The game is over and we ended it. We will in one fell swoop clear the path to innovation in the future and pull down billions from the top of the economy to the bottom.  Position: All cash except my 5 allotted GME cuz fuck robinhood.

PLTR YOLO Update
Ain't much but, glad to endure my first baptism by fire.
Who will get in trouble after this is over and how?
Disclaimer: I know nothing. It‚Äôs hard being retarded at 18 üôè  12 shares @266. I have faith in my brothers and sisters!  My limited knowledge only lies in fundamental/long-term investing, so learning first-hand about how market manipulation can affect everyday people and not just HFTs (people I assumed are better off) made me mad. For these reasons and the fact that the lawsuits will take months, I feel that my itch for justice won‚Äôt be scratched unless someone tells me how this will never happen again.   From my understanding, RH is fucked no matter what and the hedge fund managers are hopefully facing jail time. Great. However, I don‚Äôt understand what is going to be put in place to ensure this never happens again. People will just get replaced or get off virtually unscathed, so how will the government enact change to stop market manipulation? In my eyes, market manipulation is the main problem or is it something else...  Also, will trading become more positive for retail investors or will everything be the same (or worse) after this is over?  I just want to organize my thoughts and shape my views. Thx for any feedback.  EDIT: THIS IS NOT MY LIFE SAVINGS. 1/2 and 1/2 split between what I‚Äôve earned investing UDOW during pandemic and money earned at little caesars. I‚Äôm willing to throw away everything. I‚Äôm 18.
Aussie trading platform Stake has restricted trading and I think that‚Äôs good news for us
So today Stake (the platform I use) restricted trade on $GME $AMC and $NOK which got me thinking why they would do that? Every answer I could think of just reinforced the diamond hands mindset.  1. They don‚Äôt give a fuck about the small guy and their losses. Loss porn is literally a thing and that only proves that they aren‚Äôt protecting us, but their own positions. The only reason to protect yourself is if you are about to get hurt.  If someone is a about to punch you in the face but they are 2 blocks away you don‚Äôt do shit. If they are within striking distance you do everything you can to protect yourself.  2. The reputational costs of doing this are astronomical, take RH for example who possibly fucked their IPO. The cost/benefit of this means that these costs of removing shares is lower than the cost of doing nothing and getting smashed by us.  3. I could only think of two reasons before my autism kicked in and I started licking a pole.   Not financial advice. Position .18 of a share. Poor AF.  Edit: from the few comments I can see, I‚Äôm not knocking Stake. I like their platform. I also know that it was not Stakes decision to stop trading as they made clear on their email. This post was more of analysis of why Drivewealth would tell Stake to stop customers from buying the stocks.
GME Short Squeeze: What Comes Next
Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.  Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.  But what's interesting to examine   did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.  Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.  One of two things can happen to these people:  1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able 2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.  This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.  So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.  Now, why would they do this?   This is a very interesting question.    If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?  Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple   this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.  If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.  Another question to consider:  If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.  The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go   Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.  Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually   so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but   would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.  Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:  1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption. 2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.    TL;DR:   If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go   it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

Quit Trading on Margin: The Flip Side of Borrowed Shares
Hello fellow degenerates and gamblers,  I'm slightly stoned, kicked back a few beers. And being an average retard, cruising wallstreetbets, I stumbled upon Counterfeiting Stock   I'm also bad at Reddit, so have some mercy.  In   is a passage about short selling:      Short Sale   ‚Äî   Blah Blah, you can skip to the bold part   For example: If investor S wishes to  sell short, he borrows a share from the account of investor L. Investor S  immediately sells that share on the open market, so investor S now has  the cash from the sale in his account, and investor L has an IOU for the  share from investor S. When the stock price drops, investor S takes  some of the money from his account and buys a share, called ‚Äúcovering‚Äù,  which he returns to investor L's account. Investor S books a profit and  investor L has his share back. This relatively simple process is perfectly legal‚Äîso far.   The  investor lending the share most likely doesn't even know the share left  his account, since it is all electronic and occurs at the prime broker or DTC level.     If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a  short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner.    If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they  are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the  account owner.   Get out of margin accounts on all brokerages, and turn off options that have to do with stock 'borrowing'. Quit borrowing and lending your hard earned stocks. For instance,   my WeBull app has a 'Stock Lending Income Program' that I suspect is used for these purposes  . Express consent, as said in   I turned this option off, and the status went to 'Under Review'. Under review? No bro, i opted out, its not for review as far as I'm concerned.  Not all stocks are part of the income lending program on WeBull, and they give you pennies for the stock on lend, but this paranoid retail investor thinks this shit is all connected. FSM and Titan Pharma are the two companies I have held that are part of this program which provided me with a few pennies in return for holding the stock. Look at Titan's chart. With this knowledge in mind, their chart just looks like a wealth extraction scheme:        Look at the different programs you're a part of with your brokerage. I see all these fidelity posts out here, and maybe its time to be fancy myself and get a real brokerage.  TLDR; Dont trade on margin or use weird lending programs on apps. Maybe fancier brokerages don't have these sketchy programs.     Edit: Credit to u/CalamariAce for previously pointing this out:   My post can server as an autists' reminder
Not bad even at this point huh? Once up by 4000%. HOLDING UNTIL 10K!
The law does not look kindly to naked selling if you're looking for a bailout
The word "Equities", ie shares , comes from the root word aequitas:    - Aequitas (genitive aequitatis) is the Latin concept of justice, equality, conformity, symmetry, or fairness. It is the origin of the English word "equity"  Finance and its subsequent regulation is borne from Law:  - The term "equity" describes this type of ownership in English because it was regulated through the system of equity law that developed in England during the Late Middle Ages to meet the growing demands of commercial activity.  One of the most interesting things about Equity Law is the Maxims of Equity.    One of the most interesting things about these maxims are their applicability to the Market.   One maxim is "He who comes into equity must come with clean hands":  - It is often stated that one who comes into equity must come with clean hands (or alternatively, equity will not permit a party to profit by his own wrong). In other words, if you ask for help about the actions of someone else but have acted wrongly, then you do not have clean hands and you may not receive the help you seek.[13] For example, if you desire your tenant to vacate, you must have not violated the tenant's rights.  I wonder if taking a huge risk on naked calls with a bunch of boomer money is coming to the court with clean hands!!! LMAO  THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. YOU'RE A FUCKING MORON IF YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE A MOUTH BREATHER WHO LOOKED AT WIKIPEDIA 5 MINUTES AGO AND GETS OFF ON WORDS LIKE "EQUITY" AND INSTEAD OF HAVING A LIFE PAVED FOR HIM FROM HIS RICH DAD,  ACTUALLY HAD TO LEARN AT SCHOOL BUT ENJOYED IT CAUSE #LATIN  Also, my favourite crayon to eat at night before bed is sea green.

250% clearing partner charge for GME, AMC, and NOK by DTC
Stake is no longer letting us buy GME, AMC, or NOK because the DTC is requiring 250% of the value of these stocks.  This is not their decision. Their broker-dealer cannot pay the 250% charge for trading these stocks.  Read here:    Snippet from article:  >The clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.   >   >  The required amount of capital guarantee is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books.   However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of the above symbols,   the DTC has enforced an increase of 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners.     >   >DriveWealth have decided not to take on the large capital risk that comes with this significant increase.¬† We‚Äôll update you if this changes.   >   >This percentage of capital required to be held against a stock is a variable level that is stock specific.¬† It is calculated through a value at risk model (more detail on the formula is available from page 57  . Most simply, it‚Äôs a function of the riskiness of a security ‚Äì being gap risk, historical market volatility and trading volumes in individual stocks.   >   >As you can see in highly volatile markets, capital requirements rise. When paired with increased trade volumes as has recently been the case, many brokers have understandably not had the balance sheet flexibility to cater to the new requirements.   Highly volatile stocks such as GME and AMC currently carry a 100% cash collateral requirement.
SQUEEZE HAS NOT YET SQUOZE
Just compare a current one month chart in GME to a chart of the VW squeeze in 2008. VW short interest was   at the most. THERE IS STILL 120% SHORT INTEREST IN GME. They are still not buying. They are doing everything they can to manipulate and induce panic selling, so they can buy in to cover shorts as low as possible. THE FRENZY OF BUYING THAT IS COVERING SHORTS STILL HAS NOT HAPPENED. Hold strong and buy the dip. They are trying to ride out this movement and squash it with disinformation. Also, this is not financial advice, I am dumber than a second coat of paint. I just really like the stock.  Was mostly trying to point out the large dip JUST before massive squeeze. Apologies because I realize the chart I pasted kind of sucks, but google it for yourself because fuck you. Hopefully you realize that short positions eventually have to buy back the shares they borrowed. That is the real squeeze. I know that VW and GME are not the same situation, because I recognize GME is much more volatile and much more potential to squeeze higher. Lower float, higher short interest, legion of millions of retards, etc.

Hedge Fund (prior short seller) Tweets on $GME - Good Nuggets of Wisdom
He doesn't sell short any longer and offers a good perspective that can help us better understand the markets:  "Retail  investor movement galvanized by   is on day 10 of rest of your life. It‚Äôs not going away or be minimized. Gigantic hedge funds and investment banks will have to modify their behavior by using less leverage.  And learn if they push people around, expect punch in nose. "
I was at a loss, so I put in 3k. Is this how to stonk?
Dumped my   life savings into GME. I was briefly worth $198'309. Chump change, I'm holding until I'm a millionaire.
So some hedges have short interest, but don't hedges bet against other hedges?
So I guess there's a lot of negativity about these short ladder attacks driving the price down. However, I must say we are not the only players for $gme.  Hedges are more than willing to take other hedges out because in wall street, it is always about the survival of the fittest or in this case, survival of the richest.   This artificial drive down of this stock may be inversed by causing a massive spike to cause the competing firms to go bankrupt...  We should not be saying all hedges are out to get retail investors, but they are trying to get each other to play ball.  So wait for the squeeze, it will be initiated by a hedge or by short interest squeeze... This $gme squeeze looks tasty as fuck for all hedges...  So take a chill pill üíä or suppository. We will moon.    üíØüåï  Hurrrrr durrr, I like to to smell my armpits and am very stupid. This is dumb speculation, so discuss as you'd like.  Evidence supports a squeeze thesis. Depends if they force option holders to expire out of money... So exercise the in the money and force the shorts to buy if holding calls...
For those wondering why BB QNX is so good
Information from Pixelcarve:  QNX is generally regarded among engineers as the most advanced, stable and secure operating system in the world. As such it is trusted by the likes of NASA for mission critical operations, large nuclear power stations, factories, high-speed train control systems, and an endless array of embedded systems that require 0% downtime. QNX has earned its reputation and many in the computer industry believe that if QNX had chosen to compete with Microsoft and Apple and pursue a consumer sales route rather than an enterprise route, the world of computing would be generations ahead of where it is now.   So what makes it so great? QNX is built on a micro-kernel, which means that the core component of the OS (the kernel) only contains the bare minimum amount of code that can provide the mechanisms required to run an operating system. The remaining functions in a typical kernel (Monolithic OS) such as the filesystem, device drivers, application IPC, etc. are instead run outside of the kernel in the user space. Essentially what this means is that the kernel is the only software executing at the most privileged hardware level and is therefore infinitely more secure and stable. Bad drivers, software or executions can‚Äôt bring it down.  Micro-kernels also allow for RTOS, which simply means an operating system with guaranteed consistency for how long it takes to accept and complete a task. For a real-life scenario, think about the ABS brakes on a car ‚Äì they require mission critical specifications to occur in real-time or someone can die, so the system running them has to be able to guarantee the delivery, receipt and execution of messages in X amount of time or it does not qualify at RT.  The benefits of this architecture are too numerous to get into here, but one of the main benefit to RIM is its ability to execute multiple platform runtimes at the same time with high efficiency ‚Äì this is why you can write an application in C/C++, Adobe AIR, Webworks HTML5, and Java and have them all run natively on BlackBerry 10. The benefit to developers and consumers here cannot be understated. Basically ANYONE with any amount of programming experience can make an app, from high-level web based UI‚Äôs to low-level 3D games.  QNX takes their design one step further by also offering POSIX support, which is a family of IEEE standards that helps maintain OS and software compatibility. Being a full POSIX system, and not partly POSIX, ensures it‚Äôs a lot easier to develop software for the QNX platform.
New strategy: flood the options market when the price is at its lowest.
So I just saw the post about how the $800 call options have over 5k contracts open. It made me realize that what these dudes have done was to force the clearing houses to hedge against the contracts by BUYING 100 SHARES FOR EACH CONTRACT. I know 800 strike and the timeline is probably expensive. But if the dumbo hedgies try to "scare" us off with artificially low prices, we can respond by buying options contracts way out of the money, which inadvertently is probably not way out of the money at all. This could start a gamma squeeze and we can probably generate the catalyst we need to push back against the hedge funds. Buying shares is a grind, and buying 100 of them at $325 is waaaaay more expensive than buying a single call option contract. Maybe we can use this to our advantage.

GME Failure to Deliver, first half of January.
I went through the SEC failure to deliver file for the first half of January looking for GME. This is what was in there.  I'm not an Econ or finance guy. I don't know how to interperet this data, or if its even useful. Hopefully one of you can. I'm thinking that the most useful data for us is probably not here, but in case anyone was wondering, here you go.

Why AMC won't squeeze and other disappointing facts
I'm just going to get straight into it because there are too much bullshit surrounding this stock already. AMC is a solid sell at these prices, and I'll cover just some of the reasons.  \- Hedgies dumped millions of NEW shares onto market last week, in exchange for the debt of AMC they held:     And they are thinking of dumping even more NEW shares, CRUSHING any hopes of a short squeeze, just last week   more than 44m shares were sold by Silver Lake, this is the same amount as THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD SHORT according to Ortex data as of 15th of Jan ( the most recent release) :          And   shareholders have been diluted in their positions by around 75%!   :     And more than   100m shares have/will/are in the process of being issued  , they a issuing shares like the FED are printing money:          And most of this occurred AFTER the short interest report for Jan 15, which only showed a ABSOLUTELY pitiful   Short Interest, and only   days to cover, and cost to borrow being incredibly low - see the Ortex panel. I'd post a pic here from my account but I can't upload it at the moment. This was never high enough for a squeeze, now with all these new shares on the market or about to hit it you HONESTLY STILL THINK THERE WILL BE A SQUEEZE? STILL?       SILVER has about the same chance now of squeezing as AMC!    \   -  This is getting beyond a joke. The current price was clearly a result of baseless hype and people assuming it is still going to short squeeze. This is clearly all but a lie at this point. The company will trend back to it's fundamental value of around 2$ -$3 ( the broker consensus on IB) very quickly, as soon as people realize it's not going to squeeze anymore. This was what the price targets were when the company was talking about the real possibility of bankruptcy only about two weeks ago ( see SEC filings ). They won't go bankrupt now, at least in the near term, because they issued a shit ton of shares during the short mania, but this still leaves around   Billion in debt, and a company losing more than 100 million a month thanks to Covid.  If you are looking for a afterparty to join after GME, AMC definitely isn't it.  \       TLDR:      Don't suck others into this failing short squeeze just because got sucked in by the hypetrain and want to sell the stock you bought at 17-20$ to some other poor bastard who knows even less than you do about short squeezes.    Poistions:  Put spreads, such as  OTM bearish butterflys, verticals, and diagonals. Basically however I can get some negative deltas on this thing without paying to much in IV.  \  -

Diamond Hands Don't Mean Anything.
TL:DR Unless you control 100% of the float, this stock can be traded all the way back to $20, even if you "Diamond Hands"?  Cramer alluded to it in his post about the number of shares traded awhile ago.  As long as shares continue to trade you can go to zero.  You can lock up 99% of float and still go to zero.  Let me explain it like I'm a 5yo.  Imagine a beaver damn on a river.  This beaver damn mostly lets all the water through.  It's been built in an area that can keep about 3ft of water in it, even during droughts.  Upstream is the 5ft river coming in and downstream is the 5 ft river of water going out.  So, it stays pretty stable.  Then imagine that there is a flash flood, and simultaneously, imagine that the beavers got really motivated.  The beavers decided to improve their beaver damn to the point that it would block 99% of the water flowing through it.  Super Beaver Technology Breakthrough.  This beaver damn never breaks, and it always blocks 99% of the flow.  It was built virtually overnight, and can be built as high as needed in order to stop everything except for 1% of the water to pass.  During this flash flood you have a stream of water coming from upstream.  Yet, they're met by this magical beaver damn that can increase faster than the waters can rise.  It includes OG ballers like DFV and Burry who don't want to sell right when the flood comes, as well as the index funds who can't sell.  Soon, you'll see the flood waters backing up to 20 ft, then 44, then 76, 159, 380, and even 483.  So, that damn keeps going higher, but it still lets 1% flow out.  Now picture the flood abating.  Instead of having a 300 ft wave coming down from the mountains, it decreases to 75, then 25, then back to 5.  That pool that the beavers declared to be unbreakable, will still stand.  But the pool of water, will always go back to 3, if the flood waters above decrease.  Edit: Removed "this this" and a duplicate imagining flash flood.  Left the misspelling of dam.
German Pre-Market Update 02/02/21
Hi guys!  I've been noticing that there is quite some interest in german premarket numbers for GME and AMC here so I will try to hook you guys up with some numbers and keep this updated every 15 minutes.  Premarket opens at 7:30am central european time (1:30am eastern time, 10:30pm pacific time)   last updated 08:38am     140,00‚Ç¨  - 169,12$    9,00‚Ç¨  - 10,87$  100‚Ç¨ = 120,8$       How does pre market work in Germany?    Our equivalent to Robinhood is called Traderepublic. All orders made through Traderepublic are traded through a private stock exchange called "Lang & Schwarz" (engl: long & black, lmao). Trading starts at 7:30am central european time (1:30am eastern time, 10:30pm pacific time).       How relevant are these numbers for the US market?    I don't really know. From what I noticed they don't mean alot but I know you guys are addicted to looking a 1 minute candles. Be aware that   volume is super low compared to US markets  .     If this post gets some attention I'm willing to do this the next couple of days. Good luck to everyone holding positions in GME and AMC!     Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor.
What the fuck. I don‚Äôt know if this is allowed but this was literally from arguing with a person on a Melvin apologist group. Can you believe that actually exists? I‚Äôll post more source if this is allowed on WSB, member since early 2020 btw not new!

Final Outcome Clarification
Hello Dysfunctional Tarzans,  Ok, so I can barely read as much as the next shit throwing monkey that roams these autistic lands and with that being said I was able to do a significant amount of DD in the form of reading every single WSB post in the past few weeks since this GME stuff really started to take off. So I am basically the smartest helmet.   MY QUESTION : If over 100% of the GME shares where shorted by the Hedge Funds, and shorted shares being that they are borrowed and never actually paid for (yet) and then we have a bunch of retail investors that flood the market and pay cash for the GME shares so that we own the shares. This being the case, does that mean that every single retail investor has the opportunity to tell the Hedge Fund what price to pay for their share at? I mean if the Hedge Funds told the SEC that they own over 100% of the GME shares when retail investors actually own their shares. Then why are we not all of us setting our sell limit to 100k and no less. Forcing the Hedge Funds to pay that share price for every single GME share for every single investor that is selling.    Like if I go on my account right now and set my sell limit to 100k right now, will the hedge fund eventually be absolutely 100% forced to pay that price no matter what? Like, they NEED my shares. The people who bought .5 shares of GME they don't just WANT  your half a share, they are in desperate NEED for that .5 share because they lied when they told the SEC how many shares they have so you could sell that half a share for 50k if you wanted to.  I know people have been saying that retail investors have the power right now. And is this how? Because we can set the price. Like an actual fixed price that they 100% have to pay no matter what.   THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. THE OTHER DAY I BURNED MY HAND AND TO COOL IT OFF I PUT MY HAND UNDER HOT WATER.  Thank you for reading! Please don't remove this mods, you guys are awesome!
Please read this you apes. This will be longer than we thought.
Read these links if you aren‚Äôt lazy:      I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions  TLDR;   Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally "closing out" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.    So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.  I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (  short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had   MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.  What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.  Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article:    In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:  "Assuming that XYZ (  GME) is a hard to borrow security (  apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as ‚Äúreset transactions,‚Äù in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm‚Äôs responsibility to close out a failure to deliver."  It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.  I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.  I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.  More DD:      Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner   One paragraph for the lazy or idiotic from the link: (credit to u/bcRIPster)  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean the bet WSB played‚Ä¶ that Marvin had 140% of the FLOAT. I mean that Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock have sold more than the TOTAL SHARES that EXIST.  That's a completely different problem and it's punishable by jail time. Not a joke. It's basically counterfeiting stock shares, although that's not the terminology used. If this is true, who knows how many other times they‚Äôve done this. Or maybe it's not true, and they just really like the stock??? If BlackRock started buying five days ago, and the longest they can likely do this is 21 days, then the doomsday clock doesn‚Äôt run out until at least February 17th. If Wall Street can get WSB to sell before then, then they won‚Äôt get caught and won‚Äôt go to jail. But if they don‚Äôt‚Ä¶. well, this will make Enron look like chump change.  If enough people hold until the end of February, and this is truly the situation, then there is a chance that major parts of Wall Street are going to IMPLODE.     - The Conclusion    -  Apes need diamond hands until the end of February in order to get the SEC involved, most likely somewhere between Feb 17th - 19th. Whether or not this will happen is anybody's guess, but if it does all heck may break loose!‚Äù    My opinion? This, along with the fact that a shit ton of calls expiring March 19th that we‚Äôre just bought (see the front page of WSB) means that this may not end for a few weeks, maybe even longer. The only way hedge funds will lose is if the shares are HELD.  Are we going to do this???? Or are we going to paper hand out? If we‚Äôre commuting to this shit let‚Äôs do it!!!! If you‚Äôre gonna paper hand eventually we don‚Äôt want you, get out. It just makes it worse the later you paper hand. Someone else who will diamond hand those shares should have the chance to buy them and appreciate them for what they are.  TLDR: If these guys are right about there theory about what is going down behind the scenes, you may have to hold up until end of February or even longer. But this shit is happening. ALSO dont watch the ticker every day or you will get burnt out. This is REALLY important. Take a walk, workout, read, watch TV, spend some time with family; take some breaks from staring at the ticker. It may not do much other than be manipulated lower, rise slightly, and be stable in the near term. But this will squeeze the day that shorts are legally forced to cover due to the shit they pulled         I own GME, like the stock, and this is not financial advice. It‚Äôs merely a suggestion, and trying to help people learn more. Nothing more, you can do as you choose.
Stake suspending buys on GME AMC NOK
Forgive me for knowing less about this than my toaster does. Anyone here got a couple of brain cells to rub together and form a view?  From Stake:  We have just received notification, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, will not be able to offer Buys on GameStop ($GME), AMC Entertainment ($AMC) and Nokia ($NOK) due to increased capital requirements set by the DTC.  Any buy orders on any of these symbols made after Monday‚Äôs close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open Tuesday. To be clear, this is not a decision Stake has made. As DriveWealth is our broker-dealer, we can only reflect the securities they make available. As such, we are unable to confirm when this may change. If you‚Äôd like to understand more about the DTC and capital requirements, we‚Äôve provided more information below. When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement.  The clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process. The required amount of capital guarantee is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of the above symbols, the DTC has enforced an increase of 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners. DriveWealth have decided not to take on the large capital risk that comes with this significant increase.  We‚Äôll update you if this changes. This percentage of capital required to be held against a stock is a variable level that is stock specific.  It is calculated through a value at risk model (more detail on the formula is available from page 57 here). Most simply, it‚Äôs a function of the riskiness of a security ‚Äì being gap risk, historical market volatility and trading volumes in individual stocks.  As you can see in highly volatile markets, capital requirements rise. When paired with increased trade volumes as has recently been the case, many brokers have understandably not had the balance sheet flexibility to cater to the new requirements. Highly volatile stocks such as GME and AMC currently carry a 100% cash collateral requirement. All transactions are settled by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). Under normal circumstances, a DTC member is required to allocate a certain percentage of their balance sheet capital to settle such trades in advance with NSCC. During last Thursday‚Äôs session, aggregate capital requirements rose from US$26b to US$  across all brokerages. While DriveWealth was able to cater to new requirements, further increase has meant DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in $GME and $AMC (each stock has its own capital requirement rather a broker wide requirement).  Restricting access to certain stocks allows a brokerage to stay operational and ensure that all customers assets are protected.
KJETILL STJERNE TWITTER DELETION
The ‚ÄúViking‚Äù who was rumoured but pretty much confirmed to have helped mess up the algos on Friday to close above 320 has deleted his Twitter.  He stated he was investing 640millilm into $gme and was the one countering the short ladder attacks.   Does anyone have anymore information on why he deleted his twitter and why he changed his name to ‚ÄúFOR THE CLIENTS‚Äù?  Edit: He has changed his name to ‚ÄúTheEndofShorts‚Äù and says he is digging deep over the next few days for the clients.

Lakeland Industries NASDAQ: LAKE
Alright retards. Lakeland Industries. 10-15% short interest & constantly abused by wannabe hedge funds.   It's a small cap manufacturer of protective equipment and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market worldwide. The company has a robust balance sheet, and current trades at a \~4x expected fiscal year ended 2021 EBITDA on a fully diluted basis (which is a complete joke).  The valuation is dumb for two reasons: 1) a general misunderstanding by the market that this is purely a COVID-19 play; 2) the company has traditionally been known as sleepy and a poor allocator of capital, which, contrary to its valuation, is no longer the case.   Driven by a new management team and a newly implemented ERP system, the company‚Äôs recent financial performance has been outstanding since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Q3 revenues for the fiscal year 2021 came in at $ , representing growth of 18% from Q3, and 50% from the prior year‚Äôs Q3 of fiscal 2020. Increased demand for its products, and significant improvements in gross margins, Lakeland has enabled Lakeland to generate cash from operations of $  million over the last twelve months. As a result of this success, the company‚Äôs balance sheet now features a total cash balance of $  million, and no debt. Lakeland is one of the few producers of protective equipment to own its manufacturing facilities, which has enabled it to service customers globally far quicker than its larger competitors, who rely on contractors. An effective supply chain is an important differentiator in today‚Äôs environment.   The capital structure is clean. Lakeland only has one class of shares, the total share count is fairly low, and directors and shareholders own roughly   of the company. Stock options outstanding also are very low (only about 24,900 as at October 31, 2020). The company does repurchase shares from time to time, but has not done so during the current fiscal year.   Judging by the low trading multiples, the market has clearly branded this exclusively as a COVID-19 PPE stock. This appears to be far from the truth. Lakeland estimates that approximately 35% of its revenue is driven by COVID-19 PPE requirements, and the remainder of its revenue is related to product segments not related to the pandemic. Lakeland is therefore uniquely positioned to benefit not only from the newly emerging industrial cleaning industry, but also from the economic recovery. Management has been mindful to not pivot its core business entirely from protective equipment for various industries (O&G, fire safety, chemical) to servicing COVID-19 demand, so that it can continue to excel as the pandemic subsides.   The big question for investors right now is what will Lakeland do with its glut of cash? The current management team is demonstrating a strong understanding of its cost structure, driven by its recent implementation of an ERP system.  Low margin SKUs have been culled, which has led to improved gross margins. The facilities in Vietnam and India are being expanded to meet the increased, and sustainable, demand in developing markets. On an annualized basis for the current fiscal year, Lakeland is currently clipping at a ROIC of 30%. Therefore I‚Äôm a proponent for reinvestment, and expect management to pursue scaling this business up. Complemented by a renewed societal focus on protective equipment, and buoyed by continuous PP&E stockpiling which is likely to sustain well into 2022, Lakeland is in a prime position to scale up its success and accelerate its already impressive growth trajectory.     Catalyst    ¬∑ Significant re-rate by the market once Lakeland sustains its impressive results as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A targeted EV/EBITDA multiple of \  is implied by comparable companies. That implies a TARGET PRICE OF $57, which will be easy to achieve and is backed by results.    Basically this thing will have no choice to rocket as it keeps ringing in stellar quarters.
Who do you think can hold out longer!? You‚Äôre account losing money? Or Billionaires having to PAY MORE EVERY DAY due to INTEREST!?
GME will go back up and rocket soon  Why: well let‚Äôs see here, oh yeah, the short interest is still above 100% (fuck you S3 and you‚Äôre bullshit numbers)  The amount of volume trading has gone down from 130+ million to 20-40M yet the number of buys versus sells is still heavily skewed towards buys meanwhile hedge funds are manipulating the stock by making MASSIVE amounts of tiny calls and puts and buys and sells IN ORDER TO DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN AND TRICK ALGORITHMS into thinking there are massive sell offs when in reality everyone is buying and holding  DO NOT FALL FOR THESE SCARE TACTICS!!!   The longer we buy and hold, the worse their short interest gets and the more this hurts them  PLEASE UNDERSTAND it costs YOU NOTHING TO HOLD, because YOU HAVENT LOST MONEY YET UNLESS YOU SELL (don‚Äôt)  BUT hedge funds are LOSING BILLIONS EVERYDAY DUE TO THE INTEREST ON THEIR SHORT PUTS  THEY BORROWED STOCK AT $10/SHARE AND NOW THOSE STOCKS ARE $200+ PER SHARE, they have to pay the difference!!!  WHO DO YOU THINK CAN HOLD OUT LONGER!?!?  Billionaires losing billions everyday or your account going further in the red despite not actually owing any money!?!?!?   THIS IS WHY WE HOLD!!!
ICLN is a long hold
ICLN is a strong hold under President BUYDEN  ICLN is an etf that holds a lot of green energy stocks - a lot of PLUG power as well. It has been growing steadily thus far and I know it will grow a lot more into 2021 with Biden putting up a lot of money into green energy.   Here's a list of things Biden is doing for green energy, which will ultimately push ICLN upwards :  1. Joining the Paris Climate Agreement 2. Cancelling the Keystone Oil Pipeline 3.  Biden will invest $400 billion over ten years, as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment, in clean energy and innovation. That investment is twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in today‚Äôs dollars. He will also establish ARPA-C, a new research agency focused on accelerating climate technologies.¬†  4. Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the   building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work with our nation‚Äôs governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. And, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone.  5.  Biden will require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. In his first year, he‚Äôll work to enact legislation requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. But that‚Äôs not all: Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation to hold corporate executives personally accountable ‚Äì including jail time when merited. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute ‚Äì affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities ‚Äì without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. These companies must be accountable to the American people, the communities where they operate, and the workers they employ.  6.  Every federal dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden Administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of this climate crisis. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacture all the materials that go into it, and all of these workers must have the option to join a union and collectively bargain. Biden will ensure his   incorporates labor provisions so federal investments create millions of middle-class jobs, benefiting workers across industries.¬†   All of this is straight from his website. Since ICLN is an etf and does not swing ( A good thing IMO ) it is an extremely good candidate for buying shares.  But since we like to live on the edge, the best thing for us to do would be to buy ATM or ITM options that expire a long time from now.   Position : 1 $ICLN 30c exp 1/21/2022, ( Can only afford 1. I am a student and rest is in GME )

GME  monkey style üêí
THIS IS MY OPINION - not advice  # üôàmonkey see no evil   - the ticker doesn‚Äôt mean shit right now, short ladders and buy restrictions deflate the price to fire sale levels  # üôâmonkey hear no evil   - News is full of shit right now (regarding market coverage). I have lost what little faith I had in certain networks. I will be fact checking hard this week. If your lazy just ignore the news.  # üôä monkey speak no evil  - don‚Äôt wine about GME losses today. If you want to share it here, we love loss porn. I better see some fucking   and    üèª in the post though. Your sentiment spreads like wildfire. Show strength with confidence in a V-shaped recovery.   ## For my FBI agent:  Sue me  # üêíWho dat monkey  Ive been consuming this reddit and GME news like WAY too much. I want to share my new brain wrinkles. However, I am a gullible retard, who still eats crayons well into his early 20‚Äôs. I am basically illiterate. I had to voice text this message.  # For my fellow     I think the people will win. Hedge funds can keep artificially lowering the price, but enough people with  üèª can see past the spoon fed ticker price and refuse to give the short sellers the liquidity needed. I believe short interest is still close to %100 (maybe more). Someone please comment links.  ## More Ape  , More Power  The 5 million brand new retail investors on wallstreetbets will see the way. Hold to the  . YOU CANNOT trust mainstream news right.  # The Bad Monkey  Hedge funds have been doing this for a long time. Engineer a crash to get people to sell and give you what you want basically for free. It used to only cost a few 10s of millions to incite panic and crash something value.   Look up jim Cramer dirty hedge fund tactics.   Quick before it gets removed.  ## Seems good monkey, MORE EVIL  They are even blowing millions hyping silver+(other shit), trying to get us so excited we sell GME at this deflated price to dive in the next big thing. They even said reddit frenzy (wsb) likes it. No one but bots even mentioned silver. Of course Citadel(loaned billions to GME shorting hedge fund, Melvin capital. Also owns Robinhood) is long on silver. They are trying to use the power of retail against itself.  ### wat monkey to do?  I believe if, and only if enough retailers   üèª GME, sketchy hedge funds will have to close their positions (not just write an article saying they did). The counterfeit shares being used to by bears to drag down the price will dry up. The more money they spend driving down price artificially, the more violent they get squeezed out.   Together we are strong  # For the illiterate: üôâüôàüôä    =üêíüêíüêíüêíüêí       Edit:

What happens when GME drops the bomb and creates X millions of new shares with a capital raise?
There is a reason massive numbers of out of the money puts are being sold. Real ones know. Don‚Äôt be caught without a chair when the music stops. A capital raise is in the works and you know what side is ‚Äòin the know on this‚Äô.   Only a matter of time before the company issues millions of new shares and they get dumped on everyone to pay down their debt.  Company has $1 billion of debt.  How does it pay its debt back? Sure as shit not with its current sales and revenue. It creates millions of new shares at X price and dumps them on the market and pockets the cash to use any way it sees fit.  Happens all the time. Stonks 101.  Most new retards here don‚Äôt even have a clue what this means. Without question it‚Äôs in the works and it‚Äôs going to get dropped like a bomb on everyone. Maybe not this week or   it will happen.   The OTM puts will all be printing.

SEC Complaint form
Here‚Äôs a link to SEC if anybody wants to file a complaint for the vast issue plaguing our free market. Off the top of my I head I believe, market manipulation by both Marvin Capital and other Hedge funds but also against trading platforms and clearing houses. These platforms who knowingly kept lesser then necessary reserve capital in a volatile market. Let‚Äôs not forget the paid advertisement attempting to influence a stock (not sure that‚Äôs legal). Then we have the issue of the Naked Shorts and alleged counterfeit shares. But what do I know, not a financial advisor or lawyer.

FISV puts
Melvin Capital who is getting killed and is short GameStop owns 1Billion in FISV. It would be a shame if FISV went down a bunch and Melvin Capital had no choice but to buy back GameStop.  The 13f holdings are late and could hypothetically be window dressing and may not currently be held.. Not a recommendations to buy FISV puts. Just saying this so we have less of a target on our backs when the Hedge funds are already doing the same thing and targeting those who are overexposed need someone to point the finger at.   I got a finger for them!

GME short numbers are about 150% of realistic float!!! Hold tight for storm to pass
Realistic float of GME  50m minus "9m from Ryan RC Ventures" minus "15-20m from this reddit group" = 21m-26m  Lets say SI is 28m on Sunday. Add SI from today and you will get 31m of SI.  Now SI to realistic float ratio = 125-150% - VERY VERY HIGH!!!  KEY IS TO HOLDDDDDDDDD !!! DIAMOND HANDS!!!!  What everyone misses is that ENTIRE FLOAT IS NOT UP FOR GRAB, which is different from other stocks. You have RC Venture with 9m shares and out of 8 million diehards of Reddit wallstreetbets/gme groups, it‚Äôs easy to assume we have 15-20m shares among us in diamond hands! So realistic float of 21-26m is much more important than the textbook float of 50m. So that makes 31m of SI very high stacked against worst case realistic float of 26m!! Even if few people drop out (too bad they will miss huge gains potentials) then we are looking at 100% ratio at a minimum. Now imagine Ryan Cohen announces major news for GameStop like raising stake or huge tie up and stock jumps organically? Shorts are scared of that surprise. Porsche did exactly that with Volkswagen. Once short ladder attacks are over, low hanging fruits are grabbed up from paper hands and interest starts pounding on these HFs, the stock will jump exponentially!!   Must read: Feb01 COB article from a reputed writer on SeekingAlpha:  ‚ÄúThe GME momentum higher will probably continue for some more days, even weeks. Some of the short-selling hedge funds will disappear - bankrupted or bought out (likely pennies on the dollar). When that happens, the GME rally/momentum will stop‚Äù  See how HF‚Äôs trick you:
DIAMOND HANDS       My butthole has never been this tight
GME Volume was 35M today. The lowest yet.
Listen up, there is some serious manipulation going on here. Today, volume was only 35M compared to 59M on Friday which was also the lowest. Each day, the volume has gotten lower and lower. Last Monday the volume was 176M. Right now, the volume is 20% of what it was a week ago. Don't be fooled by the ladder down scheme and other illegal shit the Hedge Funds and whoever else is on it is pulling. Something really illegal is going on, and yes, the squeeze is still on. With volume this low that means we are witnessing massive price manipulation.  /I am not a financial advisor. Please do your own DD and come to your own conclusions.

Great info on TWNK. I did not write this!! Just copied..
Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies)  I posted this TWNK long thesis in r/stocks,  , but think it has a home in r/options as well given the 15% short interest, low IV, cheap options, and potential for gamma squeeze. Appreciate any and all thoughts.  # TL;DR    Hostess Brands (TWNK)   has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is an iconic brand, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation.    Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.     # Intro  Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won‚Äôt see a squeeze of GME‚Äôs magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call ‚Äúasymmetric upside‚Äù (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I‚Äôll describe below.    So what‚Äôs the target?      Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)   . You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can‚Äôt make this up)‚Ä¶  For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public in 2016. The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there‚Äôs no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.  The company also has warrants from the their IPO (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $  per one full share and expire in November 2021.    So what‚Äôs the thesis?   We think there‚Äôs an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.  # Technical Thesis  1.   High short interest = squeeze opportunity   ‚Äì Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we‚Äôre aware of (can‚Äôt really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds. 2.   Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover   ‚Äì Average 3-month daily trading volume of   shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about  13+ DAYS  for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the retail pool of capital. If you‚Äôre looking for a bit of diversification, this is the name. 3.   The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside   ‚Äì There‚Äôs actually been option activity picking up on this company.    On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for   of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)    .  See  . Most of those options were sold OTM at the $  strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.  # Fundamental Thesis  1.   Snacking continues to be king.   Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of   adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one. 2.   Strong organic growth story  . Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing ‚Äì and likely gaining share. 3.   Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.   Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies.    At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article     .    4.   The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.   Voortman sells cr√®me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the ‚Äúbetter-for-you‚Äù snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess‚Äô existing distribution footprint. 5.   COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company‚Äôs primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).   Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.  # Potential Risks  1.   Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.   The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend. 2.   Pretty high leverage for a public company.   They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \  in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \  before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage. 3.   Customer concentration.   The Company‚Äôs largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don‚Äôt think retail stores will do anything irrational. 4.   Rebound of COVID-19.   Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.  # Appendix      TWNK Q3'20 investor presentation  :     TWNK acquisition of Voortman Cookies investor presentation:       Reference for TWNK short interest:         Reference for AMC short interest of 10-15%:          Disclaimer: I own a position in the Stock (TWNK); Warrants (TWNKW); August 20, 2021 $  Call Options ( ; and August 20, 2021 $  Call Options (TWNK210820C20)          Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and is purely written for entertainment purposes. Please conduct your own diligence. Past performance is not indicative of future results.     # Conclusion  If you‚Äôre looking for a little diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.     Again, this is not intended to distract from other holdings you may have. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.
Why lithium is biggest Play in the coming next few weeks. $LAC Stonk can give you BIGGEST gains!
Everyone in biden administration wants to be long on the Climate therefore lots of subsidies and hype is to go long on EV and solar. The biggest EV automaker is TESLA. Tesla is huge in demand, its factories is set up in Nevada. They all LITHIUM to power their cars up.  $LAC lithium americas corp just got approval from govt for lithium mining in Thacker Pass. Thacker pass has the most lithium deposit in USA and its located in nevada and its merely only 200 miles away from Tesla factories. $LAC already mining lithium in the Argentina and few other places so they are already know what they are doing and own thacker pass location in Nevada.  They are projected to start mining lithium in January 2022 and construction is almost complete as much as 60 percent. They are now signing. parnerships which are under NDA and I reckon one of the partnerships is TESLA and other big automakers such as GM, Ford, Toyota etc.  Currently we dont have biggest lithium miners in US, so in order to rise big in this revolution, US govt is helping $LAC and probabaly $LAC being the biggest lithium miner in US is a great thing for its economy and its automakers economy. Lithium americas currently raised 400 million dollars at average price of $22, currently its trading under that, so its a discount for you, but it wont stay longer. Once the partnerships are announced, it will rise big, now is the time to buy and hold.  Lithium is the new oil, This is easily can go 40s --> 50s --> 60  > after the launch easily can be trading may be even north of 100s. If your grandfather or dad missed on OIL investment, this is the best thing up and running now, so now is the time to give a second look. Check out $LAC.          Math Time:   In thinking about value, we hppen to enjoy simple convenience of a Nice Round Number. 101 million shares Outstanding. A $2 billion Market cap (almost exactly) $20 per share, $3 billion @ $30 per share and so on OR $40 per share to reach 4 bilion market cap. To ask "is it possible $LAC could hit $40???????  > is to ask , could market could ever hit $4 billion.  In assesing value more specically, we can also enjoy the simplicity of approaching the company as sum of its part on two primary assets: 49 % interest in the Causchari-Olaroz brine project in Jujuy Province, Argentina ("CO") AND a 100 % Interest in the Thacker Pass project in Nevada USA ("TP")  Construction of CP is over 60 % COMPLETE already, and fully capitalized. Construction will complete Q4 2021, AND Lithium Production will begin Q1 January 2022 (11 months from now) at 2 Million Tons proven and probable reserve of battery grade lithium in Carbonate equivalent ("LCE"). Production capacity of 40,000 tons per annum ("TPA"). Operating cost of $  A 40 year project Life.  Construction of TP, of course, has not started but underlying resource is well documented.   Million tons of LCE proven and probable. Production Capacity of 60,000 tpa. Operating Cost of Around $4,000/Ton. A 46 year project life.  Conservatively 80,000 Tpa of LCE X $12Lk/ton (LAC's assumed avg price) = $ 960 Million revenue minus $4k/ton (high end of cost of production) = $640 million EBITDA. But in my opinion, thats too LOW. We are on precipice of unprecedented surge in worldwide demand for LCE. Experts say Demand will in crease 10x IN Ten years, Some are saying 6x demand will increase by 2024 alone. LEC prices have already risen 50 % in 6 months but are still very depressed. If LCE recovers just to 2018 levels ($25k/Ton): 80k Tpax$25k/ton=   Billion revenue, $  billion EBITDA.  As for what multiple should apply to these figures, your guess is as good as mine. For illustration, ALB boasts $   Billion revenue, $853 EBITDA, A $  billion Market Cap, fetching a trailing price/sales of  , SQM has   billion revenue, $572 m EBITDA, a $  billion Market cap, fetching a P/S   May be $LAC is lower, or higher, or somewhere in between. i leave it greater minds of Fellows here than my own mind to Project.  But if (1) despite Surging demand LCE Spot prices never rise a penny above $12k/ton and (2) we apply a very low 5x sales ration, fair value of LAC could be $  billion ,   $48/share. If LCE price recover to 2018 elvels we keep the same low 5x sales ratio fair price for LAC could be 10 billion,   $100/share. iF lac Fetches the same multiple as SQM (  x sales) we get $  Billion   $167/share. And if Worldwide Demand for battery grade lithium Carbonate Rockets beyond supply as anyone paying attention predicts it   friends, is when "2 DA MOON" starts to sound apt.
This scene has been in my head on repeat the last couple of days. (Longer version in the comments.)
BB - QNX Microkernel Cybersecurity Bull Case
Hello Friends,  TL;DR -  BB   Blackberry has an architecturally secure embedded operating system compared to competitors, safety and security are important for electric vehicles, military use, and future IoT devices, I am holding 2000 shares of blackberry and suggest you buy to hold for longterm gains.      I'm a cybersecurity sector employee. I have previously brought you detailed analysis surrounding the capabilities of   and what you can do to help yourself.  Anyway, moving past establishing credibility, here is my analysis on why I am bullish about the security posture surrounding the Blackberry QNX operating system in comparison to other competitors in the embedded RTOS environment.  # What is RTOS  RTOS is Real-Time Operating System. Most operating systems do not need to perform tasks within predictable computation timeframes, as we tend not to notice any performance difference. This is why it takes either 7 minutes or 11 lifetimes to download Winrar. With an RTOS, the primary applications are time-sensitive or mission-critical operating systems. These include power plants, water treatment facilities, dams, vehicles, drones, and further applications. If your system does not operate in a predictable fashion within set timeframes and capacities, you cannot rely on it for ensuring your dam doesn't overflow, your autonomous vehicles does not crash, or your drone can stay afloat in the air.  # Start with Monolithic OS  Most RTOS are monolithic as far as their OS architecture goes. Generally, systems are built into Kernel and User land. A monolith tends to control all system management within Kernel-land with user applications running in Userland. The issue with this approach is reliability. Any individual failure can potentially crash the OS, which is an unacceptable condition for many of the above applications.  In addition, trying to modify the monolithic OS is difficult to do without a complete shutdown. Shutting down a drone or train mid-journey is not feasible. For cybersecurity purposes, the attack surface is enormous as any individual part of the system (including applications) can affect the reliability of the OS.  Good news is that they're more performant though!  # MicroKernel  QNX is a MicroKernel architecture. The MicroKernel only does process isolation / memory management / task switching. All other standard OS operations (file system, drivers, networking, etc) are performed in UserLand instead.  This architecture is useful because it means that:    Individual component failures will not compromise the entire OS. So for drones, a bug in a camera application or in the network traffic will not affect the flight of the drone. This is pertinent in the context of power plants, dams, military equipment, and autonomous/electric vehicles.   When a component fails, it is easy to detect the point of failure. Monolithic kernels are difficult to trace faults in, especially as services get coupled together.   Live restoration, if a component fails it can be restored without taking the system offline.   Isolation, processes do not share memory or processing space, preventing many classes of memory manipulation bugs / security flaws such as buffer overflows, use after free, etc.   Systems can be built to scale or share workload across multiple Userland apps, potentially preventing the crash entirely at the cost of degraded performance.  So look, the architecture of the QNX system puts it in a great position compared to other monolithic kernels in the embedded OS space.     # Key QNX benefits  Memory Protection - Typically, an OS assigns a block of memory to a process for it to store either data or instructions. QNX assigns a process a block of virtual memory, that is then mapped to physical memory with spatial separation between each block. This means that you cannot reliably change the operation of the program or read the data effectively when given physical access. Sure, ASLR, Canaries, and the Guard space do exist in modern OS's, but in embedded space memory is much tighter so this is a key benefit!  CPU Scheduling - CPU's use a variety of scheduling algorithms to give processes different weights for execution. This can become problematic when critical processes end up being stalled because low priority processes are hogging CPU time due to bugs or manipulation (such as regex backtracking for validation). QNX uses adaptive partioning which basically enforces that each application is partitioned to have a predetermined set of resources such as memory, filespace, or cpu time. This makes it difficult to starve any particular critical process of resources.  Safety & Compliance - The OS has pre-configured designs ready for compliance with EC 61508 (industrial), IEC 61511, EN 50128 (rail), IEC 62304 (medical) or ISO 26262 (automotive) industry standards. These are rigorous engineering standards that are designed to enforce strict safety measures, monitoring for faults, and procedures for operating. Compliance with any of these is a long and arduous process, which BB has been working on for a long time. Other embedded system vendors have not met these standards yet, or have only chosen to focus on their key industries.  Security - Normal Standards like secure boot, integrity validation of all programs prior to execution, address space validation, application isolation and sandboxing, data and network and inter-process access control, and execution of everything from userland (no root) are all other benefits I don't have time to get too deep into.  # Some other pieces     This is a good blogpost that details how the microkernel is able to quickly identify deviations from the standard, apply logging, and pinpoint where to analyze further for performance or security remediation.     This was in response to an iOS update that showed when applications were accessing a users clipboard. Tiktok and facebook were accessing the clipboard p. much every second. Conspiracy theorists would say that Tiktok was harvesting user clipboard data hoping for PII or credentials. Regardless, BB was prepared for this attack vector already as demonstrated by this quick blog post as a response.     Building their own competitor to TLS, the standard for secure web communication. The web's based off of a Request/Response model, but BB allows for PubSub, Voice, and Video amongst other secure data transmission methods. Looking into their encryption algorithm support, Argon2 stands out as it is a relatively recent (with low uptake) hashing algorithm.  # Summary  Overall, hope this gives you some confidence that BB are market leaders in the embedded OS space, as the microkernel architecture does set them apart when compared to competitors in the business, and their existing big enterprise relationships and 100% certification and compliance to safety/security standards should get them into many new critical infrastructure, military, drone, and electric vehicle embedded systems.  2000 shares BB @

If the recent placed calls are from HF so that they could cover the loss then there's something that should really bother you. (I hope I'm wrong)
Hear me out:  HF can artificially drop the price, that way they rely on panic selling and can keep doing short selling and earn thanks to that.  The only reason the price is down right now is cause of them, this means that when they'll stop short selling then the price'll go up.  Till now, we already knew this, but there's just one problem. If their decision to stop short selling leads to the consequent rise of the price, this means they can also decide when the price has to go up. Since the only reason why the price is down is cause of them, if they believe nobody is going to sell they can stop short selling and start buying thousands of calls and earn the money back thanks to our diamond hands...  So basically, they have no way to lose their money. I really hope I'm wrong about this. Am I?
IMO: SQUEEZE IS STILL COMING. And they know it. They're using both sides to minimize total losses. Covering short positions during these "manufactured" dips. And then planning to make additional $ on these $800+ call options. Thus, minimizing their total losses once we leave the atmosphere.
Could be a combination of the following, but either way I think the   SQUEEZE   is still imminent... We're just witnessing them minimizing their total losses. Here's how...  The dip today ( possibly a few more days ) is giving the Shorts a chance to exit "some positions" on a manufactured dip. Perhaps, saving them from being closed out of some spots BEFORE the price heads towards   .   However, there just isn't enough volume for them to really cut significant /all losses. Because most continue to hold/not intimated by the ladder attacks.     Next up, we have a significant amount of $800+ calls being purchased... where they intend to profit by purchasing out-of-the-money call options,  paying a relatively low premium for a chance of a much larger payoff. IF/WHEN   .   Just my interpretation of the current situation.  AND most important of all, requires all the current stock holders to stay the course and not sell until possible SQUEEZE is SQUOZE.  \ Not a financial advisor, just a dumb dumb.

THIS SHOULD BE ON THE FRONT PAGE ( PINNED ) HOLD $GME
IMPORTANT MATH LESSON FOR THE PAPER HANDS - RETAIL OWNS THE $GME FLOAT
math time...  The float is only   shares.  There's   WSB degenerates.  Let's throw out some scenarios to show how we (just the WSB degenerates), not even counting the rest of retail, could in fact own 100% of the float -  1. Every degenerate owns GME (yes I know that's not at all realistic)   /   =   shares/degenerate 2. If only 50% of the degenerates own GME   / .50(  =   shares/each 3. If only 25% of the degenerates own GME   / .25(  =   shares/each 4. If only 10% of the degenerates own GME   / .10(  =   shares/each  Let that sink in. Yes I know a lot of you have much more than than   shares, and a lot have only 1 or 2 shares (or even a fraction of a share).  This doesn't take into account all of the retail that is not even on WSB that owns GME.  This doesn't take into account all of the shares Cohen and others have bought up.  Bottom line, we, retail, degenerates, autists, & retards, likely own nearly ALL OF THE FLOAT.  Hedge funds bought up the rest, holding it to squeeze their fellow assholes along with us.     TLDR SUMMARY : BUY + HOLD = TENDIES.     $GME  (and if my math is wrong, what did you expect?? I'm retarded)  Edit: I added to my $GME long position AH on the dip. Also, this is not advice (unless you like retarded advice.)  \+++ RIP Screech Powers +++
Cramer, at least try to hide it, please... it's more fun that way.
Lol a loss still a win imo 4200.   . I opened the td ameritrade account when webull stopped letting us buy gme for a second.
Why the S3 Short Interest Data May Be Accurate (But is answering the wrong question)
Disclaimer: Do not listen to me, not a financial professional, I can't tell if I'm paranoid and retarded or have some brain wrinkles anymore. This is not financial advice, blah blah blah, suck my dick SEC.     Simply put, the S3 Short Interest data is probably fairly accurate. But it's not answering the relevant question.     Anyone with any statistical background knows that asking the right question is as important as any analysis you do.     For short interest there are two relevant questions:  1. What is the net exposure to a short in a hedge fund's portfolio? 2. How many shares still have yet to be bought that must be bought in order to cover?     It is my belief that S3's data is answering the first question but not the second.     Lately there has been a significant increase in volume for super OTM puts and super OTM calls. Selling a put is a bullish position and buying a call is a bullish position. However, the shares associated with these positions ARE NOT NECESSARILY PURCHASED YET. This is particularly true for selling a naked put.     My thought is that hedge funds have begun selling a FUCK TON of otm naked puts. This creates some revenue for them and also, on paper, effectively closest their exposure to a short position. So, if you're short 100 shares and you sell a put (taking on the obligation to buy 100 shares at a certain, low, price, if the contract is exercised) you are effectively hedged. Thus as long as that contract is open, it may appear to S3's algorithms that the position is closed.     The problem arises because those 100 shares linked to the sold put ARE NOT purchased yet if the hedge funds are selling naked puts. They are just floating about. So while the net exposure to short positions is reduced, the need to buy shares has not been alleviated.     Perhaps the squeeze has been squoze. Perhaps not.     I would appreciate any feedback that people have. I'm trying to determine for myself how plausible this is. Maybe I've got some brain wrinkles. Maybe I'm completely braindead. idk. lmk.
Why I‚Äôm Holding
Listen y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôve only been in this since the beginning of December and I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm tired of the hedge funds cheating, and the brokers blocking us from buying shares conveniently when the squeeze was about to launch. I‚Äôm not here for glory or gains anymore, I‚Äôm here because I hate the system. It‚Äôs stacked against us, everywhere we look, the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. We start to win for once and they change the rules of the game. I‚Äôm holding on to a measly 30 shares, but I‚Äôm holding until bust. I‚Äôm so tired of them beating us down just because we attempt to make what is essentially spare change to them. Screw the hedge funds, screw the media, screw the class system in place here in America. I‚ÄôM NOT SELLING.   TLDR: GME               I just really like the stock. I also just really hate the system.  None of what I say is financial advice. Everyone has their own risk tolerance. I just think the stock is cool. G, M, & E are my favorite letters.
READ THIS - THEY ARE SCREWED - NUMBERS DONT LIE
The real short % according to S3's data is 122%. However, their 55% figure is technically not a lie, but extremely misleading. I will explain everything.     Here is what they did:   Sources (S3 head):                 S3 head is redefining share float to include shares that don't exist in order to be able to say shorted % of float is lower.     it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted)     So, by this definition, if a stock is shorted 400% of existing shares (total banana count borrowed and resold 4x) and total shares is 100, short % is calculated like this:   400 shorts / (100 shares + 400 longs whose shares are borrowed) =     That is, the normal way we define short % would say it's 400% shorted. S3's way says 80%.     Knowing this formula, we can work back to what S3 would have said the short % of float was using the normal definition of short % of float:   55% short of float means for all existing shares + shorts (or, ont he other side of the trade "longs whose shares were borrowed away to short") is 55/45 as much as existing shares. Meaning, portion of shares short by the normal definition (% of existing bananas borrowed) is 55/45 =       That is, S3's data is telling them that after friday trading, GME is still 122% short.      \ disclaimer ripped this off some guy on tradingview, but havent seen it on here (ETCH1234)  Edits:  14 shares @ Avg 110              This is not financial advice but I do have a rock hard boner.   TLDR: HEDGE CHANGE MATH MAKE NUMBER GO DOWN, NUMBER GOOD FOR APE. APE HOLD = APE GO ON ROCKET
The SEC is mostly USELESS
Aside from the occasional Martha Stewart, the SEC routinely fails to investigate and act on the naked short selling activities of large hedgefunds.      They failed to act on Bear Stearns. They failed to act on Bernie Madoff EVEN after they were tipped off.        Instead, it was Palantir's software that tipped off the SIPC.      The SEC is unlikely to act in favor of the retail investors because of one reason:  These employees have a good shot at retiring from the government to an executive position at these very hedgefunds. These current employees are incentivized to not act against the hedgefunds during their careers.  We should just replace the SEC with Palantir.  TL;DR: Calls on Palantir / Puts on the SEC /    $GME

REMEMBER GME Insiders Cannot Sell due to pre-earnings Blackout Period
I'm echoing a post from 7 days ago that pointed out that insiders (board members, large individual shareholders) CANNOT SELL until the earnings report.     This means daddy cohen with 14+% of the company and the rest of the Boomer board that own cumulatively like 25+% of the stock CANNOT SELL AND ARE DEFACTO DIAMOND HANDS.  Here's a link to one source for large holdings:    RC Ventures, Donlad Foss, George Sherman are all board members and you can bet your ass that Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity and others aint gonna sell. Fuck, the country of Norway owns   of the damn stock (Statens Pensjonsfond Utland).   Earnings is March 25 post-market.   This is not investment advice, make your own decisions. I own some shares of gamestop.

THinK..... lol GME
If you have ever seen something up 1000+ % fall then you know it does not just slowly dry up ....  it dumps and dumps hard  If today was a dump then we would be under $150 for sure with better volume!  and the halt down today ... come on ... that made me laugh so hard to see it pop right back up after it re opened. Had to be the silliest halt down i have EVER seen  holding and buying if they push it over then oh well but thing(s) like this do not happen often and this is different  no advice given im just stupid and know nothing

MOM YOU DIDNT RAISE ME TO BE A LITTLE BITCH LOL
Similar to what brokers claimed to be the problem last week, hedge funds closing their shorts will have an enormous liquidity problem too.
TL;DR: there is only so much money hedge funds can cover their shorts, don‚Äôt be TOO greedy.   Some people are calling for GME to hit 10,000 or 50,000 at some point. If GME hits 10,000 that‚Äôs 700 Billion dollars tied into the market cap (10,000 share price x 70 million shares). If it hits 50,000 that‚Äôs   trillion dollars (50,000 a share x 70 million shares).   To be clear it seems that retail investors own 100% of GME, and some how hedge funds also own 130% of GME. So at 10,000-50,000 levels, retail investors would have between 300 billion-   trillion, and somehow hedge funds would have to cover between  400 billion -   trillion to close their shorts.   These numbers do not compute with being able to be paid off by shorts covering, because hedge funds don‚Äôt have THAT much money. Both stimulus bills combined are just shy of the market cap of GME 50,000.   Just saying be realistic on price guys. At GME 1,000 that‚Äôs 70 billion tied into the market cap, and that MIGHT be possible for the shorts to cover. Melvin capital is down 50% this year on what? A 15 billion dollar loss? Even if they lose ALL their money at GME 1,000 we still need to find 5 billion to short cover the rest. AND that‚Äôs only 100% of the float, they have apparently shorted 130%. Sure MAYBE they could cover at GME 2,500, beyond that there would be liquidity problems and bankruptcy filings. Maybe I‚Äôm just totally out of touch and ranting at a wall here though.
Database for future accountability?
We are seeing a media frenzy pushing a narrative that we know is separated from reality. Whatever the outcome of this event, it will be colossal. If there are sweeping legislative changes to market accessibility, if fees and requirements are hiked back up to pre-Robinhood days, if Mel Mel and the Hedge Boys start a socio-political insurrection to protect their wallets, whatever... It will get swept under the rug at the first available opportunity.  I suggest, given the absurd amount of misinformation being distributed en masse, that it may be in the best interest of the shareholders to have a compiled database of reference material consisting of the false narratives and their source, both for our own use as well as future necessity in the face of currently unforeseen backlash or subterfuge against we the shareholders, such as a smear   against WSB or Reddit, or a legislative censorship initiative, or SEC or other regulatory investigation, etc., etc., so that, rather than flail our arms and be labeled "conspiracy nuts," we can provide a single link to a compilation of information that shows not only the list of lies that are being levered against us, but also those who spoke them.  I don't personally have the resources or knowledge to build a database, so if this remains merely my half-baked rambling and never comes to fruition, so be it. But if you do have such abilities or resources, perhaps this statement will be the driving factor which spurs you to action.  Dude I really don't  intentionally  write like a fucking douchenozzle, I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I read a bunch of fancy books as a kid, it's whatever.  Smooth brain, diamond hands.
RobinHood money raised recently is more than they have raised in their entire existence. With this new cash injection, if what this article says it true it should be trading as usual right?! Or are they covering for something bigger?

Can we for once, objectively talk about the pros and cons of this theory that the hedge funds are manipulating the price action? NO mods, I don‚Äôt have a meme for you, it‚Äôs called DD.
Listen, sheeple... On the one hand we have people that believe the retail investors (that‚Äôs you, retard), are buying and/or holding. The volume indicators seem to show that this is true for the most part, but I‚Äôm too fucking stupid and/or skeptical to be convinced. How the fuck do you know JPM for example hasn‚Äôt started dumping their massive holdings in GME?   On the other hand, we have all these conspiracy theories that that the hedges are manipulating the price by various means such as ‚Äúladdering‚Äù (creating false downside volume by essentially trading between themselves rapidly in a coordinated effort). One of the things that bothers me about this theory is that I‚Äôve yet to see anyone come here and convincingly explain how this works to the downside or if it‚Äôs complete bullshit.  IF we are all buying like we sure as fuck say we are , then HOW is the stock price moving down. Is it really manipulation or is that just what we want to believe? I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm not into self-reenforcing theories and bullshit.  Is the stock moving down because you people are scared little bitches?  Is the stock moving down because it‚Äôs being manipulated, and if so, HOW?  Is the stock moving down because of legitimate institutional unloading?  Somebody please ELI5 because most the idiots in here are flying completely blind and  a mass exodus will be inevitable unless the quality of the information around here starts to improve beyond emoji and memes. Please stop being sheep and start asking legitimate questions or you stand to lose everything.

1000 shares one by one in quick succession, Would this Hypothetically be a long ladder attack?
If you can‚Äôt read TLDR at end.    I want to emphasize upfront THIS IS ALL HYPOTHETICAL and in way shape or form am suggesting to do anything in this post.    Put your tin foil hats on for a moment. If a group of people were to buy 1 share of a stock at a time in quick succession, would this be the exact opposite of a short ladder attack? A counter perhaps? Is a long ladder attack a thing?    If this is possible, wouldn‚Äôt this just be correcting the market value since it had been so manipulated? The hedge funds are playing dirty and it feels like an unfair fight. This post is for educational purposes only. I like the stock.  ü§ë The hedge-fund billionaires are working overtime, plotting against us and paying the media and whoever has influence to get away everything. We need to step it up! I believe we need to get the smartest retards among us connected in a group to do some serious DD and bring enough solid proof of these counterfeit shares and manipulation.  We   need to fling  üí© at every company that is doing us dirty. Get us in contact with any journals you guys know and let‚Äôs get our own WSB articles out. Let‚Äôs all spam the Sec with the facts from our DD findings on GME and let‚Äôs be as vocal as possible outside of Reddit.  üí∞Think about how important the SEC‚Äôs credibility is. Do you think they would risk that to save Melvin and some other hedgefunds? If the public knows what‚Äôs going on is illegal and we pressure the SEC to REGULATE the market and do there damn job, then how could they not. Imagine how much people would pull out money from the market if the SEC lost there credibility? We don‚Äôt actually need to play dirty to win but we need all be active besides just GME TO THE MOON     and   .  Let‚Äôs put hours of work in like Wallstreet does and let‚Äôs get shit done.     Sorry if some of this was rant like, I appreciate everything you guys do in this sub!! I put my life savings in at 335 to show support, but If we go down it sure as hell won‚Äôt be without the hardest fight we could possibly put up!!!!  TLDRüñï   let‚Äôs get more DD. Also is buying 1 share at a time fast considered a long ladder attack.  Not financial advice, I eat deodorant.
Why does this sentiment seem radical? Are we the bad guys or are the institutions trying to crush American industry the bad guys?

Contrarian opinion: what if we‚Äôre at (or past) the top of all these meme stocks?
Maybe there‚Äôs no conspiracy against all of us. What if - hear me out - that volume has simply gone down on stocks like GME, AMC, and others, and the price is simply correcting itself at a lower price? Maybe the fact that all your coworkers and friends were talking about daytrading GameStop on their phone maybe meant we were at the top of the cycle?  If you‚Äôre reading this and you bought in GME at $350/share, and you want to    this just to impress some internet strangers, gotta tell you, it might not be worth it.   Positions: CVS, ELY, MSFT, and others because i cashed out GME and AMC on Friday.  Can‚Äôt wait for this to get downvoted into oblivion.
Point72, Steve Cohen's hedge fund who just loaned money to Melvin Capital, has just begun raising money from new investors. Interesting timing....
WSB movie by real WSB user - if GME hits 500 I will legit do this
#WSB Movie by actual WSB user  Both MGM studios and Netflix have launched projects to create WSB movies. Sure, they have access to Hollywoo big names and millions of moolahs, but what they don't know is that I have a copy of Hitfilm Express: Paid Version and mild autism.   Truth be told, I started working on MY OWN screenplay for a WSB movie back in   MARCH 2020  . It featured a group of ragtag billionaires on a secret tax-free island who invent AI-robot algotrader/sexbots that develop sentience and start murdering their creators. It's like a mix between  The Beach  (2000) and  Wolf of Wall Street  (2013), but everyone dies like in  The Departed  (2006) and  Hamlet  (1603).   Now that project must be scrapped entirely so that I can throw my hat into the fray and make a GME period piece. It aims to be like the Blair Witch Project but even lower budget and scarier.  Below is a  . I would appreciate any constructive criticism and I am also soliciting actors.        ##INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT  The camera opens on my wife and her boyfriend sleeping on their Alaska King size bed, surrounded by a trio of greyhound dogs. Pan downward towards me, laying prone on the floor with my face illuminated in the glow of a decades-old Macbook. I stifle my giggles as I read a funny post by /u/brbcripwalking. He titled it ‚ÄúA Bear's Guide to Maruchan Ramen flavors.‚Äù My wife's boyfriend throws one of his 10,000 pillows at me.            --: My Wife's Boyfriend: Ethlaw shut up! x Me: Sorry Chad. x    I smile sheepishly. I have a pillow now!       ##INT. BASEMENT ‚Äì DAY   My computer screen tells me today is Thursday January 28th. While munching on a raw packet of ramen, I scroll through a very very old DD post on GME by /u/deepfuckingvalue. Some of the words are big but some of the words are small too, so I think I get it. I decide to YOLO my wife's life-savings into GME with a market-buy order. My cost basis is $483 per share.       ##EXT. BREADLINE ‚Äì DAY   I check my phone nervously. I do not look well. It is clear that I have been banished from the house for my indiscretion.       ##EXT. UNDERNEATH A BRIDGE ‚Äì THAT NIGHT   I show the other homeless people my GME entry price and they immediately remove their own gloves and blankets to give to me.       ##EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC ‚Äì FRIDAY FEBRUARY 28th 2021, DURING MARKET HOURS  The streets have not been kind to me. I have murdered a Hot Nuts vendor and am using his cart to charge my phone. I check the GME stock price.     The lighting in this scene is very important. You know the part in Pulp Fiction where they open the briefcase and their faces shine with the golden reflection? I wanna do that for this part, except it's a green candle on ETRADE beaming out of my phone to shine on my face.      I cannot believe my eyes. My trade has turned profitable. I quickly paperhand. I am now a thousand-aire. I immediately order an Uber to Atlantic City to try to double my winnings at the blackjack table.       ##INT. 2003 HONDA CIVIC ‚Äì SAME DAY   My Uber costs $368. I sit in the front seat. The Uber driver has a name but I forgot it. We have an intense discussion of GME's fundamentals and price movement in real time as he drives the 131 miles to Atlantic City. (This part takes up most of the movie).       ##INT. HARD ROCK HOTEL & CASINO ATLANTIC CITY ‚Äì THAT AFTERNOON  I sit at a blackjack table, surrounded by prostitutes. My Uber driver is also there. I am playing with my hand open. The Dealer deals me an Ace and a King.            --: Dealer (to me): Congrats. 21. x Me: Hit me. x Hooker #3: But you have... x Me: Hit me! x    The dealer is cowed by my high-t levels. He hits me with a Jack. I go bust. I start laughing like Joaquin Phoenix in that one movie.            --: Me: I fucking love this!!!! x     END        ##Questions:     1. Is it cheaper to hire real hookers or actresses to play hookers? Can I write one off as a business expense but not the other?  2. Anyone wanna help on this project? This could be like a stone soup thing. I know /u/jaydon1 has some hookers we could borrow, and /u/loves2fuckm4rriedMILFS might know someone who could play my wife.

You guys are fucking retarted.
You won the day with GME but the short squeeze is over. But in case you were wondering it‚Äôs not sustainable and losing all your gains or hard earned money isn‚Äôt something you should be proud of. The goal should be to make money not to hold for loss porn.  That being said your loss porn is brilliant. Well played.  Positions: only SPAC warrants baby because I Yolo just not GME.

Diamond Hands Will Prevail - 9000+ shares still holding.
Been a GME holder since mid 2020. My cost basis was $7 at it's lowest - some of you may remember my posts.                    \~ 10,000 shares of GME and various options. I could have sold at $450 but I chose to hold. Now I have taken some profits along the way, but this represents a significant portion of my holdings still.     I have no clue wtf is going on with all the media lies and BS and artificial suppression of buy side demand by RH and others - but remember the following     1. Short squeeze is just ONE aspect of GME - there is a potential long term fundamental play as well. We are degenerate gamblers, but the ROOT of the GME thesis was ALWAYS A SOUND FUNDAMENTALS BASED THESIS 2. Ryan Cohen/Management turnaround plans, I think they are in a silent period prior to earnings. But I can imagine that this earnings call is going to be interesting. I hope they do some accounting voodoo and fuck over all these idiots who are calling GME a failing company. 3. If they can project strong e-com growth for 21/22 (20-50%+), and the market finally understands GME is going to be a gaming e-commerce powerhouse in the future, we may see a re-rating to Chewy-esque multiples. $20-30B valuation is not crazy in that case, current stock price doesn't sound too wild now does it? 4. If Ryan Cohen is truly able to transform the business, increase the TAM by adding new verticals like PC/E-Sports/Digital Platforms/Advertising - GME has a real chance at becoming a $50b company in 2-3 years. 5. Dont listen to the financial news - these are the same retards who thought GME was bankrupt last year. These are the same retards who think GME is a failing brick and mortar and that nobody buys games from physical stores anymore (despite GME doing $5 BILLION DOLLARS in revenue from their stores last year).     TL;DR HOLD GME & BUY IF YOU CAN - whether for the squeeze, or for the long term potential of the company. The new may spin this as a gamble/speculation - but you don't see them pushing this narrative for retarded fucking obscene unrealistic speculative valuations like Snowflake and DoorDash do you? This is pure media manipulation and fuck Jim Cramer.

‚ö†Ô∏è (New Members) $GME You're number one issue : CAPITULATION
Everybody's got a plan until they get punched üëäüèª in the facs. True test of üîπ   is how much pain can you withstand before capitulation happens? Balls of steel or little grapes, this will define which type you have. Funds have tons of calculating cut throat phsycos whom have lost all humanity to this game, they have a tolerance for pain that some of you have only felt maybe a tiny fraction of today. This is thier game. That's how they see it, because that's how it is. If you want to change that you're going to have to put the work in, your going to have to ride emotions your going through and react like a robot. You're going to have to have BIG STEEL BALLS DRAGGING ON THE FLOOR WITH YOUR MEGA DONG RESTING ON IT.   If your DONG is dinky then you'll capitulate or maybe you already have. If you did, your a bitch who got into a trade you knew nothing about and couldn't see it through. Now you've only solidified that your a loser.   (Only redemption is to get back in and ride this dragon.)   ____________  Understanding Capitulation  By definition,¬†capitulation¬†means to surrender or give up. In financial circles, this term is used to indicate the point in time when investors have decided to give up on trying to recapture lost gains as a result of falling stock prices. Suppose a stock you own has dropped by 10%. There are two options that can be taken: you can wait it out and hope the stock begins to appreciate, or you can¬†realize the loss¬†by selling the stock. If the majority of investors decides to wait it out, then stock price will likely remain relatively stable. However, if the majority of investors decides to capitulate and give up on the stock, then there will be a sharp decline in its price. When this occurrence is significant across the entire market, it is known as market capitulation.  More:
Still up all in all but last night hurt just a little bit. Not fucking selling tho
For those of you that dont know why price dropped today, read this. $GME $AMC
I know it's scary with money on the line, but the last thing you want to cloud your judgement and trading is emotion. Check out this tweet. He explains a sell ladder with great clarity. If we hold and buy the dips, price will regain as demand steps back in. Keep those    strong. This week is going to have a lot of this happening.  I love this stonk!
Why Im holding: I dont know enough about the market, but I do know enough about marketing and Astroturf  . Holy shit there are lot of them going on.
This is the piece of information that has really sealed the deal for me this week and can not be explained away.  Innocent people with nothing to lose dont take the time or spend the money to create astroturf and floods of misinformation.......  This is a move for guilty as fuck people with a lot of skin in the game.  You think the shorts are out?  If they were, they would not give a shit about changing the narrative.  Here is why I think they picked silver:  1. It was already going up with gold, so they just had to point at it and say "look!"  1.   its so fucking big $$$ wise that we cant effect it. So they arent giving us any control in their new narrative  1.    Silver is a total boomer thing, so its highly unlikely that any of us would have and shares to sell anyway.  1.    Its pretty victimless because its a commodity. If they had said the name of an individual company, it would have been much more targeted and would have caused more problems for them.  If I was on their marketing team, I couldnt have picked a better red haring  I got into this last week on damn good information.  Before the bullshit started.  We know that GME was 130% short halfway though January (NYSE Report).  We know that DFV is still in.  We know that someone out there with something to lose is throwing a small army of "reporters" market manipulators at us.  Most of all, I know that my worst loses have always come when I have folded out of fear.  I would rather ride this to the GME fair value of $150 then bitch out now and possibly miss my shot.  Edit per /u/Ostnic:  No.  We can not trust the data.  I would say even the NYSE report coming out on the 9th.  If these guys are willing to commit fraud and market manipulation, they will lie on a report.  That is assuming they dont have some  tool to fudge the numbers legally.  I cant tell you enough how easy it is to change a statistic to fit a narrative.  Dont believe anything is a fact unless you can personally verify it with your own eyes.  These   are engineered to hit you from every angle and distort your reality.
Lost half my gains today. Not fucking selling    Only my 2nd day in the red since buying GME, after years in the red. Scared money don't make no money, still up 3k all time.
4 shares at avg 220 ish . Also My Broker is down ... coincidence ? My broker is almost never down ... first time in 6+ years. Can almost hear the whole system creaking ... first time so many broker issues have happened globally also. Hold !
An open letter to Melvin&Co
Dear Hedgies,  Silver?!? This might have worked if this war was between you and some other beef jerky skinned, dial-up, Hawaiian shirt wearing,  , unseasoned chicken, pass the mash potatoes, 15 mile walk to school, back-in-the day motherf\ ckers....  But we like the STOCK!!  These are degenerates you're at war with, we'd much rather go for a cool stock than silver.  Be weary, my wife's boyfriend approves this message.  I'm not stupid, only retarded, this isn't financial advice,  #holdtheline
Still holding, the wife has 55 too, no limits on anything except my buy orders
It‚Äôs amazing to me how much Robinhood contradicts themselves when trying to ‚Äúeducate us‚Äù.
$GME is a time bomb and it's highlighting a severe vulnerability in the financial system.
### Disclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a network security researcher -- my job is to find and explain vulnerabilities in other complicated systems that my smooth brain barely understands.        Guess what you fucking idiot -- you aren't allowed to collapse the entire financial market in less than a week using a phone app. It takes more time.       # There are likely several million new synthetic longs of $GME, diluting the market, that were created on 01/28/21.  They were created by a market maker (or possibly several market makers) to stop the beginning of a short squeeze that would have bankrupted hedge funds if a margin call hit them, which ultimately could have financially impacted those market makers once liability for the shares was transferred. These shares weren't borrowed from anyone. They're imaginary. Pure fiction. A promise only a handful of entities can make.  The reason they did this was to buy time to save their own asses.  .  The creators of those shares have 21 days to deliver. Until then, they aren't paying interest. There isn't a public record of their creation -- the closest insight we have to the number of synthetic longs in existence for $GME are the  , and $GME is a major outlier in that field. A fucking terrifying outlier.  We aren't bleeding out a hedge fund by holding. Melvin very likely  is  out of their position after losing half of their fund. There aren't 'new shorts replacing the old'. Instead, a buffer of imaginary stock was created by a market maker to 'flatten the curve' when a massive number of shorts had to cover once retail buyers started rushing in.       # That's why you aren't seeing short interest increase even though there aren't any short shares left to borrow.    These assholes are praying that in the next month, retail buyers get scared, bored, or distracted.   They're spreading FUD, attacking with short ladders, hoping you watch the short interest drop and think it's over. They're counting on you to sell your $GME at a bargain rate so you can pay rent, because they think  you're just fucking retail scum betting on a shit company,  and they've been playing this game longer than you've been alive.  They're also counting on you to obsess over things you can measure that they can hide. They want you to set rules and limits on when you're going to run away.       # Simultaneous to the creation of these synthetic longs, DTCC increased collateral requirements on 01/28/21 to purchase $GME to 100%.  This led smaller brokers like Robinhood to restrict trading, depressing the price, conveniently making it less expensive for market makers to recover their synthetic longs.     The people that pushed this collateral increase knew exactly what would happen  , because  it's their job  to know what the impact will be when they make changes like this.  DTCC openly stated they increased collateral requirements for $GME to reduce risk to their organization.   DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearinghouses if the market makers went bankrupt.   They know exactly what the failure-to-deliver numbers mean for this security.   It's possible that DTCC created new collateral requirements in coordination with the flood of synthetic longs explicitly to make it easier to recover those shares. It is also possible these actions were taken without any coordination with market makers, because DTCC knows it could have   and stretched out a squeeze through this act alone.    Their strategy is to stretch out a short squeeze into a 'long high' they can recover from if retail shares are sold over time, since retail can't buy them back.    And the people working at DTCC likely rationalized this was 'the right thing to do' -- to prevent a systemic failure that could have impacted the entire stock market -- because preventing systemic failures is the only reason organizations like DTCC exist.  Meanwhile, Robinhood -- the smallest player in the game -- honestly DTCC's buttboy in this scheme -- is going to be grilled by Congress over this shit.       # Did you think we were the only ones that saw a black swan event coming when we bought shares?  The root problem is there are several players in the market capable of creating new shares without paying interest, capable of restricting trading -- and they all face severe financial liabilities if a squeeze happens. They want to turn the squeeze into a slow burn so the damage doesn't hit them.  If we continue to hold, a squeeze could happen sometime around or after Feb 18th, or another market maker could create  even more  synthetic longs to dilute the market, passing the hot potato. This could make their problem even worse once  those shares  are bought and held.  This could continue for an extremely long period of time until a financial regulator steps in and forces them to buy the shares they've sold.         TL;DR  :   WSB is being made into a fall guy for the collapse of the market due to the creation of a massive number of preexisting synthetic longs that were bought and held. To fix it, market makers decided to make more, but their cure is also a poison they can't stop taking.    Strategy  :   Hold your positions, buy at any price you can afford to hold forever, and hope that retail owns more shares than the total number that exist for $GME. Contact the SEC and ask them to investigate and to halt trading of $GME -- time is on your side if the clock ticks down the deadlines for market makers, while the stock cannot be sold by paper hands.    Postitions  :  100 $GME    -- but only holding for $10,000/share -- I'm not so greedy that I want the entire market to collapse.
I know how we can win GME, AMC, NOK..
We all know that the system moves very slow, and by the time congress/sec does anything, it may be too late and we miss the MOASS. Propaganda works, and we will see people losing their investments which will cause them to drop their shares which benefits HF.   My proposal is,  to get the SEC to halt trading on GME, AMC,NOK etc.  It will accomplish multiple objectives:   1. No one will be able to sell!!  2. Time to find all the missing shares by the SEC. We know a big chunk of them don't exist. 3. HF losing $ on interest. (Bonus) 4. Allow everyone to get back to their lifes for a week or 2.( I got exams coming up soon)    Is it possible? What are the downsides?
No one knows what it means! It‚Äôs provocative, It gets the people HOLDING!
Only added 100 more today at 230$. I can do this all month.
The Options Maker Exemption - The hedgie's dirtiest tool.
There's been some solid discussion today regarding the tools that hedge funds, brokers and market makers use to fuck us over. I saw this post earlier:   that contained some euphoria about millions in way out of the money options were purchased this afternoon on GME. Well I'm here to tell you, this is how they make and sell shares that never existed to begin with.  Have a look at this link:    It was posted in another thread earlier as well but I took some time to go through it. The most relevant tidbit I could find is here:  >A significant amount of counterfeiting is the result of the options market exemptions. The rule allows certain options contracts to serve as borrowed shares for short sales even though there is no company issued share behind the options contract. The loophole is easily abused, helped in part by SEC's apparent inability to globally monitor compliance. There has been considerable pressure on the SEC to close the Options Maker Exemption, but through January 2008, they have refused to act.  In a nutshell, the "Options Maker Exemption" is a tool that market makers can use to "hedge" their positions should the underlying stock go against them.  They start by issuing naked options contracts, today that consisted of several thousand naked calls at $800 strike. Once those options are sold, the fund that buys them now has the "rights" to millions of shares and, thus, can sell them on the open market without ever exercising those calls. If they have enough shares they can effectively suppress the price of the underlying and buy back the shares that they sold. If the price doesn't stay below their sale price they have 3 days to supply them or the shares fail to deliver and go into an SEC report. All along, the options they purchased are assumed to be and will, in all likelihood, expire worthless which is part of the plan.  The shares that they "borrow" by doing this don't ever hit the short interest volume and you never see it reported. The books are kept hidden and when the strategy works nobody is the wiser and it's used a lot more than you think. The failure to deliver report If the strategy doesn't work, the failure to deliver report will show it but the SEC doesn't actually seem to investigate or prosecute this fraud. Here's the most recent report up to Jan 14th:   There are millions of shares that have failed to deliver across hundreds of equities because of strategies like these and the SEC does nothing.  This report is showing 621,483 shares of GME failed to deliver on Jan 14th. These are shares that people like you and I have paid for that don't actually exist. I have no doubt this number is in the millions by now. Contact your local representative!!!
The longer you squirm, the funnier it gets.

DD BYND Belief, has anyone had a McPlant?
# Mcdonalds recently announced the development and test of a meatless burger, similar to those like BYND and Impossible. They began launching the "McPlant" in Denmark and Sweden this month.  A friend of mine discovered the ingredients list of the McPant, Mcdonalds big new plant based burger. He cross examained it agianst the BYND meat burger, note...Mcdonalds and BYND have yet to anounce any partnerships on their McPlant Burger. After futher examination and many hours of labor he established the first ever "Meatless Meat Comparison Chart" or MMCC.  As you can see from the results, he found that there is a   match in raw ingredients which emcompasses both the Beyond Burger and McPlant Burger. This essentially means there's a partnership with McDonalds and Beyond which is yet to be announced or discovered. The proposed theory is Beyond Meat will be supplying all of the McPlant Burgers in a massive deal.  Feel free to do what ever you want with this information. Shout out to my friend doing all the DD, totally not financial advice in any way.

Changing the rules: creating loopholes for GME short position holders?
I've been noodling on how an institutional trader who opened a short position on GME at $20 (or less) might wriggle out.  In my experience, when Big Money gets into trouble like this, they print money (QE), "restructure," issue bailouts, and, generally speaking, CHANGE THE RULES.  Some things I've seen in the past are:  1. DILUTION. GME could issue a new block of shares; like 50,000,000 of them. This would dramatically drop the prices, as the Supply of shares available significantly increased, IF Demand remains (about)  the same. I suppose this could come from their treasury of shares; or, one of the investment banks could underwrite more? 2. BAILOUT. Could Uncle Jerome step in and cut The Boys a big fat check for the money they lost? Dress it up as some form of Quantitative Easing? 3. DEBT RESTRUCTURING/BANKRUPTCY. Create a new fund specifically for the purpose of assuming the debt and declaring bankruptcy. What happens to the debt in this case? 4. UPSTAIRS TRADING. Can a US Equity short be covered in the OTC markets? Like, could a short sale holder cover by buying directly from Gamestop at, say $25/share? Forgive my ignorance, but is there any way to cover a short BELOW the market price, maybe in a dark pool, or do NBBO rules prevent this in the   Equity markets?
It ain‚Äôt much, but it‚Äôs honest work. I ain‚Äôt fuckin leaving either
Billionaires were literally crying on national tv last week. They are FUCKED.
People only cry when they have no escape or are mentally weak.  Billionaires crying on national tv is the surest sign you can have that we have already won.

Semiconductors very undervalued. Here‚Äôs my DD.
So I saw headlines about semiconductor demand far outpacing supply. There‚Äôs also news of Intel finally giving up and no longer taking losses trying to make chips.  Cars have created an especially huge demand for semis and virtually every car now needs one.         I came across TSM Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturers which had just over 50% market share. Their biggest customer is Apple.      Now, I couldn‚Äôt believe the numbers I saw for TSM. I figured every site was wrong because the following cannot possibly be true:  Market Cap- 571 billion 2020 revenue -   Trillion (yes trillion). the revenue is up 30% from 2019 (yes during a pandemic).  Earnings- 530billion.    This means that they are trading at 1:1 P/E ratio.   Compare that to AMD (106bil market cap - 2.5billion earnings - 38 P/E and NVDA 321marketcap -   earnings - 140 P/E. Intel has market cap of $230bil - $20bil earnings - 11 p/E  So shouldn‚Äôt TSM have a market cap of at least 5 trillion?? How is no one talking about the fact that their revenue during a pandemic is   trillion with profit margin of 40%???   I think there are some seriously sweet tendies to be made. The IV is pretty low and you can get 2022 calls with a 200 strike for $5. Or a 2023 call with 200strike for $12.   Someone please explain how this is possible and what I am missing. This is a no brainer.   Also, for the first time ever, TSM will be building a plant in the USA      Lastly, Biden has a phone call with TSM this Friday.   EDIT: thank you for pointing out that my numbers were in TWN not USD.  I effed up.  Still a great company.

Why eBay is going to roll on their earnings
By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.   Here‚Äôs some DD for anybody who doesn‚Äôt eat breath and sleep only GME.   eBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That‚Äôs just a given.    I am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks.    Lots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I‚Äôm not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn‚Äôt why I‚Äôm going fucking hard in the calls. Here‚Äôs the real cherry on top:  eBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it‚Äôs just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.   Well guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn‚Äôt even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week.   This is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it‚Äôs time we do the same.   Oh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok√©mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It‚Äôs 2021.   eBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I‚Äôll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well. Play at your own risk.    TLDR; My positions are eBay CALL 05/FEB/21 60CALL , 62CALL and 65CALL
We're all screwed.
Guys it's over. Someone has to speak truth. The squeeze is over. Short interest is way down. S3 has real time info. All the other data people are throwing around is dated. Updated filings will be tomorrow. When they show short interest is way down everyone will be heaeing for the door. All yall who bought in the last week, youre the bag holders. Sorry people. Its a rout and then a slow drain towards a normal valuation.   And for those or you who claim Im a shill for the hedge funds, Ive been here a long time. I was diamond hands with the rest of the retards shorting spy in   the way through June. People on this board will talk you into diamond hands all the way to the poorhouse.
BCRX -- A Group of Longs From StockTwits Make Their Case
yes yes, BCRX is a really weird way to spell GME/AMC/BB etc.  Moving right along....    The Shorts - The Side Show    Let‚Äôs be honest, the real reason anyone is in WSB right now is to fist shorts. BCRX, however, is also a company that needs to gap up to reach fair value.  Fist the shorts and hold the gains.  Biocryst has a high and steadily growing institutional ownership  . We can make these fuckers squirm with the slightest effort.  Rating:     /10    Orladeyo - The Prelude    Orladeyo has recently been approved in the  . HAE is a rare disease that affects roughly 1/50,000 people, or about \~25,000 people in the three regions mentioned previously.

Alexion‚Äôs drugs SOLIRIS¬Æ and ULTOMIRIS¬Æ are the current treatment for PNH those   over the next 24-48 months.  The point is, the company is ready to gap up on merit, but is being held back by high short activity.  Rating:           /10    Galidesivir - The Wild Card    If you aren‚Äôt already excited, maybe you‚Äôll be excited by a drug  .   Why didn‚Äôt we already have this drug?  That‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess, but politics seems to have something to do with it.  No one can yet determine the value or ultimate use of galidesivir as it is tied up in government development contracts. The company has already   that it is developing galidesivir for government contracts and shareholders seem to have little to do with this. So, we‚Äôll just call this the sleeping wild card.

But, in case you haven‚Äôt found a soft spot for this company, they appear close to a first time cure for an extremely rare disease called   cripples children when their joints fuse together with excess bone. Children affected by FOP often end up wheelchair bound by age 11. Can‚Äôt tell you this drug will be a money maker as the affected population is too small.

Alexion has market exclusivity until 2025 for Soliris.   highlight that analysts believe the 39B purchase of Alexion was a fire sale due to mismanagement. If Factor D received at least the same discounted valuation as ALXN, that would mean its market cap would increase from   to 39B. Excited?  Factor D is expected not just to be equivalent to Soliris, but exceed it. BioCryst Medical Director Bill Sheridan believes Factor D will make competitors   as it cures patients earlier in the disease process than C5 and C3 inhibitors.

$GME THEORY
So we all understand that if GME is held at a certain place eventually big companies give in and close out their shorts. However they are given 2 trading days to do that (Wednesday). Ever thought that the reason Monday and Possibly Tuesday will be red is actually the big companies forcing with all their power to lower the price and exit with minimal loss when Wednesday comes? And then when they close out the Short Float being EXTEMELY LOW will cause the stock to rocket up again.... Think about it...

Why I think Robinhood's 'clearing house issues' are bullshit
I have been reading through SEC regulations for an hour and finally found something useful pertaining to this debate I've been having regarding an article who strangely gave no sources but says that brokers have to supply funding to the clearing houses for security purchases and can't use client money. This obviously could cause a liquidity issue for a smaller broker like Robinhood last week but they denied any such issues.   Even so, I found that the SEC states "  believe that, at a minimum, this means that the introducing broker-dealer must: (1) be financially responsible to the clearing broker-dealer for all customer trades until the clearing broker-dealer has received payment (or securities),  , the introducing broker-dealer must be at risk to the clearing broker-dealer for its customers‚Äô failure to pay"  This says to me that if Robinhood has our funds from our bank and they have cleared (meaning isn't using margin from an instant deposit), they are at no risk of our "failure to pay" and can use that money without violating this guildeline. They fucked us hard and that's all there is to it.   If anyone has a source that credibly says otherwise on this subject I would very much like to see it.  Here's the source, pg. 22     Edit 1: someone mentioned before their comment was removed that it's not SEC regulation but DTCC policy changes that cause this so my reponse was "Oh ok, I misunderstood and thought they were referring to SEC regulations. That makes sense now though. The underlying problem is then that the DTCC is essentially a monopoly and can control the market with mere changes in policy, right?" Cause why TF would they care whos money it was if they were really just trying to make profit off of clearing.

$BB DD - NO MEEMS - PART 2
TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.  Imagine you‚Äôre John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don‚Äôt know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.  So, other than hacking into John‚Äôs brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that‚Äôs fun but usually it‚Äôs PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen‚Äôs account in which case suckle away).  But boy oh boy wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas‚Ä¶.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!  thanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let‚Äôs see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?  To start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you‚Äôre a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you‚Äôre growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don‚Äôt think they need, and last time I checked $BB‚Äôs CFO wasn‚Äôt completely retarded. Now, it‚Äôs important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they‚Äôre growing, duh) and vice versa.  FANG isn‚Äôt a perfect comp (I‚Äôll get to the others in a sec), but   serves as a good proxy of a ‚Äúbaseline growthy‚Äù tech.   No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.        # IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID ‚Äú$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG‚Äù, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU‚ÄôD BE RIGHT!!  ‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù you say. ‚Äúgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot,   to justify a   $60 / share   price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.‚Äù Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.        ‚ÄúHah,‚Äù you say smugly. ‚ÄúThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks‚Äù.  No, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I‚Äôd be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.  $BB went through   of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a   history  , and that is a blessing and a curse.    Remember  , Daddy chen‚Äôs primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained ‚Äì Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?  # IMPLICATION #2 ‚Äì BLACKBERRY HAD > 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS  This brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let‚Äôs look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let‚Äôs look at two two non-retard quotes ‚Äì     "I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company." Steve Jobs        ‚ÄúIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it‚Äôs not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.‚Äù Peter Thiel     I was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB‚Äôs Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below        Even as a $BB bull, I didn‚Äôt expect the discrepancy to be so large.  # IMPLICATION #3 ‚Äì BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS. IN MANY WAYS IT IS MORE OF A ‚ÄúSTART-UP‚Äù. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL PRESSURE, JOHNNY CHEN RETAINED TECHNICAL TALENT. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE COMPANY‚ÄôS FUTURE, AND VALUATION ???    TLDR: BB IS NOT A ROCKET SHIP. IT IS A LONG RANGE SHUTTLE, CAPABLE OF BURSTS OF SPEED, PACKED TO THE GILLS WITH RETARDS AND TERRAFORMING EQUIPMENT AND HEADING TO MARS.

Mind the bubble
I'm not saying sell everything but a few things to keep in mind  - Continued checks be printed due to pandemic - House prices at all time high (The kicker) - My friend who is at a title company said he has never seen so many refi's from people on forebearance Let that sink in,. Many Americans have put their mortgages on hold as allowed by banks due to covid.  Hence, they are raking in 3-5K in monthly income and dumping into the markets in addition to anyone with   from student loans on forebearance   Most of them do not realize their mortgage payments will go up due to deferred interest.  They keep pushing the forebearance end date back, latest date is March 31 until foreclosures can begin, keep an eye on this date  Question to consider- would a bank be motivated to foreclose at a time of all time high real estate prices?
The volume is low, now what
Ok the volume is low, but trading is restricted. So what prevents the volume from being low every day and the hedgies dropping the price 50% every day until its easy for them to cover. Why are they allowing the stock to still be restricted like this and making excuses that its the "clearing house", where are our c  on the inside to help? Its like fighting tyson with 1 hand tied behind your back. What should people do to reverse this, its insane that the price was going to explode past 600 on thursday and now we're here, at 180.

$BB DD, NO MEEMS - PART 1
Dear WSB - While I hold nothing aginst $GME, $AMC etc. - and imma let you finish - but $BB is one of the most solid fundamental, growth plays in the entire stock market, let alone the current trending meme names.  Forget about squozes and voodoo ass candlesticks.  #Ben Graham gang # . There was a great post re: the company's product line up  , make sure to check that out if you haven‚Äôt already.  My approach is to look at $BB from a    strategic    financial lens. First off, multiples off earnings are misleading, esp. w/ a company like BB where one-time and nonrecurring items are present and where there is a premium for growth vs. steady-state earnings. So as any Wall street spreadsheet monkey would do, I spread some comparables on earnings. Basically ‚Äì How does the market value similar businesses? ?  No shit BB is not a phone company anymore. They are, if you‚Äôve been paying any attention at all, an endpoint protection company. What is endpoint protection? Endpoints are basically computers, phones, but massively now also IoT ‚Äì Your smart TV is an endpoint, so is your dumb refrigerator now that has to connect to wifi, and terrifyingly so is your car, your airplane, and stuff where if shit goes wrong the result is worse than not being able to double fist another helping of chocolate ice cream.  Almost every electronic device at this point that relies on internet access is an endpoint, with corresponding security challenges. So what does this mean? It means we can take a look at    other endpoint protection / digital security    companies, see how the market values them, and see what that implies for $BB based on its own revenue.  See below a quick spread. Based on the revenue multiples currently ascribed to comparables to Blackberry, Blackberry has a target price of   at least     $60 / share.   And this is only if it is the average of its peers. I believe it is better for all the reasons previous posters have mentioned.     Long story short ‚Äì Blackberry already has the infrastructure, moat, and products in place for growth.   IF MORE PEOPLE PERCEIVED BLACKBERRY AS WHAT IT IS TODAY - A FUTURE-FACING ENDPOINT PROTECTION BUSINESS WITH GIANT ASS MOATS IN FANTASTIC END MARKETS (  MOBILITY / TRANSPORT), ITS SHARES WOULD ROCKET, SIMPLY BASED ON WHERE ‚ÄúCOMPARABLES‚Äù ARE TRADING.    In other words,    the Company is a diamond still with a coating of shit    (lack of public understanding of its current business).    In fact its inclusion as a simple meme stock may have only added an extra layer of shit   . John Chen (look up his resume), is a world class operator, and frankly almost too low key for his own good. Personally as an Asian, I sympathize ‚Äì sometimes the community focuses too much on keeping their heads down to work hard, and less than they should on messaging! Imagine if he meme'd like Elon!!!  No matter how good (or bad) the fundamentals are, you need a catalyst for the stock to moon. So, although I think it was a mixed blessing for BB to have been part of the scrum last week, there is a high likelihood of an inflection point in the perception of the company these next few weeks. You also saw the post on  .  The best part is -   even if it doesn't moon, $$BB will steadily grow and develop. Imagine -     Base case of going into orbit, with extreme upside of potential based on what's going on in the markets right now. FOr those of you non-retards, that's called     POSITIVE EXPECTED VALUE  \ \ .\ \    YOu don't have to try to "time the top" with this stock, because it's got fundamentals / non-technical reasons supporting the stock.      There's a reason John Chen took his bonuses entirely in stock the last few years.       TLDR: $BB = Buy Blackberry.    Disclaime r - My day job is actually private investing (so unlike many of you monkes I actually will have W2 income this year), I am still a retard. I just like the stock and have been  ü§≤ since 2018.  Add'l edit for those who can't read good -
No Matter What RH Says, They Fucked Up
1. If they were helping their REAL customer (Hedge Funds) they fucked everyone over royally. Doubt the will ever be proven one way or another but it doesn't matter because...  2. If it was due to margin requirements from the CH, they fucked up their risk models. THIS IS FUCKING MASSIVE.  THIS IS NOT THE COMPANY YOU SHOULD EVER CONSIDER TO HOLD YOUR CASH IN EITHER SCENARIO. As a customer the minimum you need from a broker is for them to fulfill their obligations. RH FAILED TO DO THIS NO MATTER WHAT.  Keep your existing GME in there for now, but move your money out and to a different broker as you move out of your positions, any cash move out IMMEDIATELY (this fuck up may VERY WELL bankrupt RH and you don't want to have to wait for the government to send you your check). Get out, get out now, get out fast.

1 Year, 100% ROI Challenge! January Recap + February Trades.
# TL;DR - I'm doubling a small account ($8k) with short-term trades, mostly theta gang, and showing all my trades and reasoning in the process. This is both for educating noobs, as well as working on my trading consistency.  Original Post:    See also:     =====================================================  # January Recap    January Return:        Extrapolated ROI: 488% (lol)      All Trades:          Recap:   The month started off very well. PLTR, FCEL, and ACB all performed excellently. Then I got greedy, and made a huge mistake. I tried to catch the falling knife QS, enticed by the insane premium. It tanked 5-8% nearly every day after. I did my best to reduce the cost basis using covered calls, from $65 all the way down to $ , but the stock simply continued to drop. I was forced to cut my losses, and was on the verge of giving the challenge up entirely, but GME came to the rescue and saved the portfolio. I sold the shares too early, but was just happy to break even for the month. But the real icing on the cake was a large bet on SLV at the end of the month which netted a whopping 3k profit, closed today. I didn't like the price action I was seeing on GME today so I dumped it at 250 and will not be reentering the position again. (RIP bagholders?)    Screenshot Proof:        ============================================  # February Trades  With the incredible performance of my risky January trades, I can afford to play things more conservative from here on out. No more taking risky bets on dangerous stocks like QS. I will continue to focus mostly on theta gang, wheeling and selling cash-secured puts on high-IV stocks that I am generally bullish on. I may return to PLTR if the price drops a bit from its current highs. Also taking a look at shorted stocks like BBBY if they continue to discount in price.  Beyond that, I'm getting a bearish vibe from the market, and I'm ready to switch gears. Any leftover cash I have after using the bulk of my collateral on CSPs, I may just dump into bearish option bets, such as VXX calls, SPY puts, SLV calls, and the like. This will only be a small portion of my total holdings, however, and I will have to follow the price action carefully before placing such bets.  Will update tomorrow morning with my first February trades. Also, at the current rate I will easily break 100% ROI by year end. I may just have to set a more ambitious goal, perhaps 200% ROI? We will see...       Current Positions: Cash      Current Return:        Extrapolated ROI: 488%      February Trades: (pending)

You are feeling like holding...
I've sent this letter to Mark Cuban and asked him to help put it out there:
Make of this what you will, but I did send this to him (with a paragraph of context that won't be replicated here:     An Open Letter to Wall Street        (by a retail investor):      Retail  investors across the globe get the short end of the stick. Period. This  is not just a fact, but an unwritten law of financial markets. A law  not just in the figurative sense, but in the real sense that it is     enforced     day  after day on every piece of legislation, on every contract, on every  brokerage, on every clearing house, on every exchange, on every market.  Markets are built on this assumption and thrive on making sure that the  retail investor ends up poorer or at most.... just making enough to have  him think that he is actually rich.    At  first it was told to us that this was because retail investors simply  could not understand financial markets. It was too complex of a subject  for the average citizen, therefore only the pros could succeed at it. So  they put retail investors on passive funds, bonds and whatever else was  simple and predictable enough that the pros could leverage their  "sophistication" and profit from that predictability. To this day the  narrative that retail investors are dumb and need to be protected is  propagated.    Then came 2008 and it  was revealed that the average "unsophisticated" investor was screwed  out of his retirement fund because the "sophisticated" guys and gals at  Wall Street got carried away in the ecstasy of seeing numbers get bigger  on their "sophisticated risk models".    Trying to confine retail investors to the "kids playground" of the market has not been working well. We have     great      security analysts among us, not just Mr.   ( u/DeepFuckingValue ) but  countless others that have proven to have what it takes to do proper  in-depth, timely and actionable research that led to legitimate, legal  and impressive gains. We also have had a great deal of bad DD, bad  trades and eye rolling losses posted on  r/wallstreetbets. And my point  here is that    it is ok.     We own it, warts and all.    We are not a company, not a hedge fund, not a single entity. But     we are     a community of like minded individuals,     and here I am referring to all retail investors      of which  r/wallstreetbets  is just a subset of. And this community is  showing that it can play on the same level as any sophisticated trading  firm in Wall Street     if it is allowed to.      We,  the retail investors of the world are aiming for a revolution in  financial markets. A revolution in transparency and an equalization of  opportunities. We are     tired     of the gatekeeping. Wall Street has  Bloomberg Terminals, High-Frequency algorithms in a building next to the  NYSE in order save nanoseconds in latency, the whole fucking rest of the  finance world to share information with and let's not forget their  buddies in the media that will happily oblige to give them air time to  "expose their highly informed thesis" to the masses in a sick play  resembling a cat toying with its food before devouring it. And on our  side what do we have? We have one (albeit genius) security analyst with  sick spreadsheet game sharing his insight on a platform that allows us  to democratically select what topics and ideas we value more. Then what  do we have? We've got numbers and we have heart. We have people for whom  that $30K gain is life changing, we have people that as soon as they  make some money they make a point of helping their fellow humans out  even if later on they go on to lose it all, they did their good part  while they could. Did you notice the disproportionately low amount of  ostentatious frivolous spending posts against posts of people that  actually did something good with their gains on  r/wallstreetbets?  r/wallstreetbets  is trying to save capitalism from itself, and capitalists are failing to recognize it.    Together  we have the capital to rival Wall Street on a play like GameStop, but  then they go around outside the market to try to split our firepower  into other less promising plays. They employ what for them is a little  capital but for us would be a massive hit in misinformation  ,  bots and paid actors to dissuade us from the conviction that we are  right and they are wrong.     They sabotage citizens of their own country and of the entire world in a deliberate effort to impoverish them.     Indeed  we do not have that on our side. Thank God we don't. We have numbers,  heart and a knack for seeing something good when it presents itself.  Wall Street could not handle us in a leveled fight and they know it.    Let  this message be heard by the entire world. We are tired of fighting for  the scraps and being told anything we make of it is by dumb luck. Open  the fucking gates and let's see if we cannot distribute wealth for real  using the very market that was once designed to concentrate it.   EDIT: I've sent this to   with a message to Elon Musk

GME - what is causing these huge spikes in aftermarket?
GME Bullish Pennant
Listen up your smoothbrain apes, I borrowed some crayons from my wife's boyfriend to draw the daily chart of GME and if we have a bounce back in the next day or two then we could be setting up nicely for a bullish pennat. If not then it doesn't matter because we're still holding. This is not financial advice and I don't know what I'm talking about but I like this stonk. GME
It ain't over 'til it's over. Don't let the short ladder attacks fool you. The volume does not support the price drop, and we've been EXPECTING this. Don't do something stupid like selling! Report the bots!         üåï
IFF - Updated Due Diligence And Potential HUGE Upside
Hey you guys! - Sloth  Well, today was quite a day, both for the standard GME and for my new favorite stock, IFF.   TLDR: Buy IFF, there is the potential for massive short squeeze; Gamma squeeze at $150; and earnings multiple expansion to due merger with a DuPont subsidiary.  Well, today IFF closed at $130, on strong volume. Interestingly, there we extremely strong resistance to the standard laser afternoon short ladder (started at 2:50pm). There must be a whale buying who chose or hold the stock above $130 for the close.  The further good news is there is still low volatility on this stock, so the options remain affordable, for now.   And, in regards to the Feb 19 $150 strike calls, volume was 40,000 with 177,000 open. Will be interesting to see if those purchases were to for open interest, or was someone moving them down to March.  Overall, it is still looking good for a short squeeze, and it is only 15% away from a monster Gamma squeeze at $150.        So, yes, hold GME, yes, I know there are counterfeit GME shares. I don't see how the counterfeit shares will help me make money though.   This one, on the other hand, I expect to rise rapidly, with a big pop up after it gets past $150.  Yes,of course I have positions on IFF. And no, this isn't investment advice, just a recommendation to check it out yourself.
All of Reddit is holding with us! Thank you to the other communities holding the line! DIAMOND HANDS!!
ETNs too good to be true?
I've been a long-time leveraged ETF investor (with typically \~30% of my portfolio) but the effects of beta-slippage and occasional poor tracking of the underlying index have always been difficult to factor in when making investing decisions. It's fairly hard to forecast medium-term and long-term volatility and how that might impact portfolio performance.  I have been researching ETNs and so far they seem an excellent (maybe better?) alternative to hold vs. leveraged ETFs for the following reasons:  1. No short term capital gains tax  2. Far better tracking of the underlying index 3. Don't have to worry about beta slippage  4. Slightly lower expense ratio 5. The risk of a bank/lender defaulting seems (to me) extremely low unless we have a repeat of 2008 and the bank   would obviously have severe implications on the market no matter what stocks you're holding  Can someone poke holes in the logic above?   Thanks

The Super Squeeze: Media Day
AMC Short Interest is Actually 10-15% After Recent Equity Issuances - Efforts Should be Focused on GME!!!
TL;DR: people are over-estimating AMC potential, true AMC short interest is 10-15% after a large number of recent equity issuances... FOCUS ON GME    I ran this calculation after seeing different AMC short interest figures on various websites.    I believe true AMC short interest is actually 10-15%   , which is significantly lower than what Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, etc. are saying (79% on Market Watch, 38% on Yahoo Finance, at the time of writing this post).    Since AMC's Q3‚Äô20 filing which was released on 11/05/20, they‚Äôve issued a shit ton of shares through the below means, which I don't think these finance websites are accounting for:    1. Raising $917mm in debt and equity through December and January; in a 1/22/201 filing they stated they had   Class A shares outstanding (  2. Silver Lake Partners (a now past investor) converting their debt to equity and selling out last week, represented   new Class A shares hitting the market (  3. Upcoming automatic conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares held by Dalian Wanda, a Chinese investor, represents   new Class A shares that will hit the market soon (page S-18,  . 4. Additionally, last week AMC filed to sell an additional 50mm Class A shares into the market (     Here is my calculation for short interest, including links to filings from the Company for reference:    1. (A) 287,276,558 Class A Common Stock Outstanding as of 1/22/2021 + (B) 51,796,784 Class B Common Stock will automatically convert to Class A Common Stock at 1:1 ratio because on 12/14/2020 Dalian Wanda Group's holdings of Class B Common Stock fell to 30% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock + (C) AMC filed to sell an additional 50,000,00 Class A Common Stock into the market ->  , page 1 and page S-18 2. Silver Lake Group converted $600mm of Convertible Senior Secured Notes into 44,422,860 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. Silver Lake then sold all those shares into the market last week. 5,666,000 of the Class B Common Stock outstanding then got cancelled as part of this conversion ->  , page 12 3. Looks like \  shares are sold short 4. Total shares outstanding (excl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing) = 287,276,558 + 44,422,860 = 331,699,418 5. Total shares outstanding (incl. Wanda conversion and 50MM filing (which they will probably complete given the high stock price)) = 331,699,418 + 51,796,784 - 5,666,000 + 50,000,000 = 427,830,202 6. Looks like \  shares are held by management / insiders, so float and short interest on #4 above = 328,704,636 /   short interest; and on #5 above = 424,835,420 /   short interest     In summary, I think AMC is way overhyped and those looking for a short squeeze may still realize one, but at a much lower magnitude than they might believe. Focus should be on forcing the GME short squeeze, which still looks to have +100% short interest.     Appreciate any and all discussion. My thoughts are my own, this is not financial advice.       Edit 1:   I updated the link reference for AMC filing to issue another 50mm shares into the market.    Edit 2:    I've been getting some questions on why Yahoo Finance and Market Watch are wrong. Here are my thoughts:  We are all using the same number of shares short, so it's a matter of how you calculate shares outstanding and float. My guess is these free, generic finance websites use a very standard method of calculating short interest and apply it to all companies. They're not reading through filings and fine-tuning their calculations to be specific to each company.    Yahoo Finance   (  is based off the most recent quarterly or annual report. Their   shares lines up with my #1. So it doesn't include Silver Lake's conversion of debt to equity, Dalian Wanda's upcoming conversion of Class B to Class A shares, or AMC's filing to sell an additional 50mm shares last week.    Market Watch   ( , that's an extra   shares, which when added to Market Watch's float of   shares, equals   shares in the float and thus   short interest, which is significantly lower than the   they're showing. But still, I don't necessarily agree with their float calculation and can't figure out how they get to
GME Short Interest looks like 40% - we need to verify!
Monke hold
Diamond hand till I die
If you own GME (or AMC) you NEED to file a complaint with the SEC....
This should go without saying but if you hold even a fractional fucking share of either company, you should be raising some serious hell with the SEC, local Congress reps , investigative journalists, influencers and any one else you may think will listen.       Its quite simple. The HF's overplayed their hand, and they got caught.  So bad in fact, that they are DESPERATE to unwind their positions at any and all costs.       There are 8 million people in this sub now.  Imagine if each one of us sent a complain to the SEC.  How on earth could they ignore us?  My opinion is that we have not done enough   of our own to educate people about what is going on.  Of course all of WSB is familiar with the blatant manipulation, how about your FB friends? How about Twitter? Stocktwits? Other investing forums? That journalist you went to school with? We all have a voice and we NEED to use it.    We are being owned in the media, and they are controlling OUR narrative.  All people are hearing is that a bunch of punks on WSB bought a bunch of shitty companies making the stock rise and they are all going to loose their money, cause another financial crash, and kill your 401k.  Is that what we did here? Or did we discovery that some HF's fucked up so badly due their ungodly greed that they themselves risked blowing up the ENTIRE financial institution (again) and are breaking every law conceivable trying to bail themselves out?    That's the message that all 8 million of us should be spreading right now.  I full expect each and every one of you to write to the SEC about what is happening.  The HF's may have the money, but we have the voice!      "If you ever thought you were too small to make a difference, try going to sleep with a mosquito in the room"      TL/DR: Write to the SEC about what is going on.  Use your voice to set the narrative straight and do not give up the fight!  We should be controlling our narrative.  We do that, and its GME-OVER!

I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions
TLDR;   Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally "closing out" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.    So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.  I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (  short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had   MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.  What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.  Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article:    In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:  "Assuming that XYZ (  GME) is a hard to borrow security (  apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as ‚Äúreset transactions,‚Äù in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm‚Äôs responsibility to close out a failure to deliver."  It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.  I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.  I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.  More DD:      Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner  EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:    The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the  debits  to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts    I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.    My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct.     Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can.     Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word.     I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.   If I take an L to 0, I take an L to 0. I don't invest what I can't lose. But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open.

Fundamental analysis of GME and an argument for why the speculation is perfectly reasonable
Hello to all you   special  ,  fabulous , and unsophisticated retail traders. I believe people should view GME how they view startups and tech companies, with a focus on their future potential and how their fundamentals will enable or hinder growth, instead of focusing on their current price to earnings and short term volatility. I'm long on Gamestop because of changes in leadership, their new business strategy, and because their fundamentals are    ACTUALLY       PERFECT    for company beginning to restructure and transform.    Considering the pandemic and overall state of electronic retailers, let's compare   changed how leases are accounted for effective January 2019, so operating leases are now shown as current and long term liabilities. So while GMEs debt to equity ratio looks significantly worse than Best Buys, I'd argue that its actually better. Getting out of an operating lease for a small store like Gamestop is pretty easy to negotiate or buy out, not easy to get out of a lease for the massive stores Best Buy leases. Also being F500 and having a huge market cap skewers D/E considerably. GME has a ton of cash, limited debt, and operating leases that that can be exited with    some relative    ease if needed, so Gamestop can restructure with plenty of breathing room.   Looking at the income statement and cash flows, GME earnings are not awful given the conditions of brick and mortar stores during a pandemic. While Gamestop has a net income loss, they have good gross profits, and their gross margin is better than Best Buy. Gross margin indicates their core sales and costs of goods sold (costs directly related to revenue) are solid are fundamentally good. They just have too many general and administrative (non-revenue producing) expenses. I wonder what they could do to reduce overhead expenses of supplying and maintaining retail stores? Also, net income loss  and loss in cash flows from operating activity in October 2020 was less than 2019. So while it's definitely not ideal to see they losses, they made significant progress towards having a positive net income    IN A PANDEMIC/RECESSION   , and this was still before the PS5 or Xbox Series X was released in November. GME had a positive total cash flow, but it was driven primarily from the sale of property and equipment. Sale of property and equipment is typically not a good sign for companies (think of a McDonalds not selling enough burgers so it starts selling off fryers for positive cash flow) but I believe it will be  .  This is one of the first steps in their transformation to an online retailer, which I believe will ultimately make them profitable again. If you don't believe me, you can read exactly what their plan is.   Ryan Cohen and other Chewy executives   for the lulz. They liked GMEs plan and the unique opportunity that Gamestop presents, kind of like all of us shitheads here. I think their involvement in the company will provide the necessary knowledge and experience needed to grow improve e-commerce sales. The business strategy from their October 2020 10-Q:  >  BUSINESS STRATEGY     >   >In May of 2019, we announced our multi-year transformation initiative, which we refer to as GameStop Reboot to position GameStop on the correct strategic path and fully leverage our unique position and brand in the video game industry. Our strategic plan is anchored on the following tenets.   >   >   Optimize the core business.    Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of operations across the organization, including cost restructuring, inventory management optimization, adding and growing high margin product categories, and rationalizing the global store base. Prioritizing efforts to optimize the store base and improve the fundamental operations of the business yielded the net closure of 321 stores in fiscal 2019, 461 stores year-to-date in fiscal 2020, and included both the divestiture of the Simply Mac business and wind down of underperforming operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Improved inventory management drove a significant increase in inventory turns and as a result, in working capital, while an intense focus on organization structure and expense reductions yielded a $  reduction in reported Selling, General and Administrative costs year-to-date in fiscal 2020.   >   >   Build a frictionless digital ecosystem.    Develop and deploy a frictionless consumer facing digital first omni-channel environment, including the recent relaunch and customer experience enhancements within  , the launch of a completely new GameStop App, as well as the optimization of our retail store footprint to maximize our customer reach more broadly across all channels and provide them the full spectrum of content and access to products they desire, however, wherever and whenever they want to shop. Enhancements to the user shopping experience and improved omni-channel capabilities, including expanded delivery and payment options, yielded an increase in e-commerce sales of over 430% through the third fiscal quarter of 2020.   >   >   Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.    Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStop‚Äôs addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.   >   >   Transform vendor partnerships.    Transform our vendor and partner relationships to unlock additional high-margin revenue streams through an expanded suite of product and service offerings to optimize the lifetime value of every customer.   >   >Connected to our transformation efforts, we have incurred and continue to incur severance, store closure costs and expenses for consultants and advisors. See "Consolidated Results from Operations‚ÄîSelling, General and Administrative Expenses" for further information.   >   >We continually review and prioritize our capital needs and are committed to making investments in our infrastructure to drive our business plans and realize on our transformation initiatives. Key areas of investment include improving the presentation and content as well as the functionality, general search and navigation across our customer facing digital channels; improving customer data integration and customer relations management capabilities; continuing to enhance service offerings to our customers; continuing to strengthen and deepen our information technology, analytics, marketing and e-commerce groups; and creating more flexible fulfillment options designed to improve our delivery capabilities and reduce our shipping costs. These and other investments are expected to, among other things, provide a seamless and compelling customer experience across our omni-channel retail platform.    I still think shorts did not cover, red days are meaningless short ladders, there's probably counterfeit shares floating around, and media fuckery trying to stop a huge squeeze. But    totally forgetting    all that for a second, when the fuck did every single analyst on wall street start believing that fundamentals are the only thing that matters looking at stock price? A ton of startups and tech companies that IPO trade wildly higher than their fundamentals. A big reason for this is the emerging potential of their industry and investor belief in executive leadership, look at Elon and renewable energy or Portnoy and mobile sports betting. Why should people treat a restructuring company with good liquidity, great executive leadership, and   any differently than we treat exciting startups or tech companies that aren't profitable? What's the difference between a company going through a significant and well calculated transformation vs a young new company IPOing?

Hold strong boys, your not the only one suffering.
I like this stock. I‚Äôm about to buy the mother fucking dip if they keep up the ladder attack (btw am I the only one who didn‚Äôt buy in at 300 levels???)
Today‚Äôs price drop was 100% artificial
Check this out   then check out the real time trades for literally any other stock. I saw it mentioned in here earlier, but didn‚Äôt think it got enough attention. Hedge funds are selling 100 share increments back and forth to each other every millisecond in order to drop the price. Don‚Äôt fall for this elementary level manipulation. We may be retarded, but we‚Äôre about to be rich retards.   They are terrified    Edit: sources to help explain how this works   (from 2014, wanted to find an article that didn‚Äôt originate solely due to current situations)    (talks about counterfeit shares referenced in first article)   Also, I‚Äôm not claiming to be a scientist just posting what I believe.
Why are we holding AMC? They are no longer on the SEC's "failure to deliver" list after January 12th
I feel like I got played so hard and it's all my fault for not doing my own research. Let this be a warning to all STOP PUTTING ALL FAITH INTO THE HIVE MIND AND DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. GME is clearly on SEC's "failure to deliver list" on every day provided meaning they are still most likely being shorted, but AMC is apparently cleared after the 12th meaning they are probably no longer being shorted.  SEC Site -¬†   Fails-to-Deliver-Data -¬†   January 4th - AMC - 111,844 shares @ $   January 5th - AMC - 1,631,091 shares @ $   January 7th - AMC - 4,241,943 shares @ $   January 8th - AMC - 11,547,981 shares @ $   January 9-12th - AMC not on list  January 12th - AMC - 5900 shares @ $   January 13-14th - AMC - not on list  I can see where the HYPE was coming from because apparently there was a failure to deliver 4M+ then 11M+ shares, but after that it looks like the "shorters" went on to short a much smaller supply. I guess there is still a possibility that the shorting continued, but I am having serious doubts. For those of you holding AMC, you might want to check into my claims to see that you and I got royally fucked. It's clearly not too big of a deficit if you need to sell, but you might want to sell if you have any profit left! unless you hold on to your shares with very little evidence of a future squeeze/potential (probably none). Maybe you'd like to hold onto until AMC becomes what they used to be (if that's possible), which I think I might do considering I bought in at 13 a piece. Anyway, hopefully this sparks a little controversy causing people to check my claim. I hope I'm wrong. BTW none of this is financial advise, do what you retards want  I'm definitely hanging on to my 1 GME and praying that bitch shoots to the moon  As for AMC, fuck those who are pushing for it, and fuck myself for believing in it

Aphria/Tilray - The European Giant
Aphria & Tilray Merger   Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million      >Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive   shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).  The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a   illustrating my views on US Legalization & the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20‚Äôs, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.  While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria & Tilray are slowly taking over Europe.   On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an   in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.  >More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray‚Äôs operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.    What is CC Pharma?    CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was   by Aphria in 2019.   Last week, CC Pharma   with AMP German Cannabis Group.  >AMP will organize with the support of CC Pharma, "information events" in Germany to market Aphria branded products to doctors and pharmacists; Dr. Stefan Feuerstein, Director and President of AMP, commented, "We are proud to partner with Aphria and CC Pharma GmbH. Our sole focus is to sell medical cannabis in Germany, which makes us an ideal partner to co-promote and sell the Aphria brand.    Tilray & France    The same day Aphria & CC Pharma gobble up market share in Germany, Tilray was selected by French National Agency to Supply GMP-Certified Medical Cannabis Products in     >the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.  The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in     >In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.  The amount of untapped growth potential in Europe is eyeopening & Aphria/Tilray will be first in line to benefit. I highly recommend doing your own DD and deepdiving the management. Irwin Simon moves quickly and has a great track record. I believe this company is poised to be the best.   Stay safe & GLTA  APHA 1/20/23 20 Cs @   or go long!   I am not a Financial Advisor, so please do your own DD. In my opinion, Aphria & Tilray are poised for significant growth

When will the GME squeeze be squoze? What is the endgame?
Found an interesting article, thought you retards might want to see:  Edit: I LIKE THIS STOCK AND IM HOLDING UNTIL PLUTO      TLDR: I think the options market is indicating that funds are committed to their GME shorts till March 2021. Ask yourself if you're willing to hold and outlast them. If the answer to that is yes, you can do something truly impactful here that ONLY GME can make happen. If the answer is no, then end the farce and accept that some people will go home winners, some people will go home losers, and the hedge funds will likely make most of their money back because that's what they do.    F  Not financial advice I don‚Äôt know anything

Let's talk about the GME $800 Calls for 2/5, 2/12, 2/19 and 3/19
Okay fellow   for some DD on the metric-fuckton of GME $800 call options for the above referenced expiration dates.   Obligatory I am not a financial advisor, just a smooth brain neanderthal.   I noticed a post earlier calling out the 3/19 $800 call options and the significant volume. I wanted to do some digging, below is my attempt to explain what  might  be going on. Constructive criticism and contrarian ideas are more than welcomed.   Let's start with the   were a total of 29,935 contracts of the GME $800 calls traded across these 4 expirations. This is compared to only 9,106 of open interest (for all you autists out there that don't know, the open interest aka OI is how many contracts were open through yesterday). Tomorrow morning will be interesting to see if the OI increases or   will help us understand if some of that volume was opening new positions or closing existing ones but regardless, many of them  have to be opening   new contracts  since the volume is 3x the OI. Proof below.                       Why would there be so much volume today for the GME $800 calls across so many expirations? There's a lot of different reasons this could happen, let's conduct a process of elimination to hopefully follow Occam's Razor and see what is the most likely and/or most reasonable explanation. My first assumption is that hedge funds are responsible for the volume, too much $ for retail IMO. If I take the last price at market close of each contract and add it up, this is \~$  note that these were all traded in small chunks throughout the day, no massive orders of 1,000 blocks or anything, largest is a hundred or so. They accumulated throughout the day so that $57M should be a conservative estimate. Perhaps these were traded in sweeps throughout the day to not get seen by option scanners?  I don't see a good reason why HF's would sell all these   they collect premium on downward or flat movement of GME? Yes, but that seems like a poor method to do so since the delta stinks. It also exposes the seller to  massive  risk of having to sell shares should they end up ITM. It's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, just not worth the   know they don't have shares to sell, they need to buy shares to cover their shorts.  I also don't see why these would be covered calls where they own the underlying because DUH the whole point is they are trying to obtain shares of GME to cover.  If they weren't sold naked or covered, then they had to be bought, but why? Well...\~$57M isn't  that  much when you're down billions so far on your shorts. If GME's price can be driven down through short ladder attacks from HF's to shake out weak paper handed bitches, through artificially suppressed retail demand by Brokers and their fuckery,  and through the media's fear tactics, this means 2  very important  things could be achieved: 1.) They can have GME's price be lower than it otherwise would to begin the squeeze en masse that they know is inevitable and 2.) they can recognize significant profit/hedging from their deep OTM calls options on the way up.   The HF's were caught with their pants down and have been given the luxury of time and support from external actors (Fuck you, RH IBBK TD and every other shady broker and the media) to get their ducks in a row. They are trying to engineer the squeeze  on their terms  to reduce their losses.   TLDR: There is a TON of GME $800 call volume across multiple strikes. Seems weird for them to be sold. Might be HF's plan to profit/hedge on way up once the real squeeze begins now that they have been able to grind GME down with short ladder attacks and artificially suppressed retail demand from asshole brokers.  Chime in my fellow Idiot-Savants!

It‚Äôs time for action.
I‚Äôve been here a while. Lurking.   I made posts and comments about the short squeeze when it was under 20.  I deleted everything because I was scared of the SEC. I don‚Äôt believe I was doing anything wrong, but I was starting to uncover some inconvenient data and I may have incidentally brought the issue to the attention of a large player.  We all know this is a whoever blinks, loses, game. That is why diamond hands has become so important, but we cannot just wait even though the other side is bleeding out. We need to end this with some decisiveness, otherwise we risk losing in a rigged game.   We have to get the SEC to investigate the short ladder attacks. We have to find a better way to expose what is going on. We have to do something.   TLDR: Bigger guns, more pressure, we have to make the other side blink. Legally.   Discuss.  Edit: added tldr

Yahoo Finance shows institutions own 122% of
Anyone who says these companies aren't counterfeiting shares or are doing things by the book -- take a look at this:    Scroll down to Share Statistics - it's right there in black and white. This shouldn't be possible.  Look at the same stats on Yahoo Finance for any other company. I can't find any company with anything remotely close to this number. They're (obviously) not over 100%, because HOW CAN IT BE?  It's insane to me that media outlets are saying hedge funds are closing out positions and are all on key. No big conspiracy, nothing to see here.  If something as simple as % ownership by institutions has these insane monkeyballs numbers, what else is going on really? Something smells VERY wrong here.  This house of cards can't stand up. These guys must be scared shitless because all the shit I've seen, every stat, every report, every DD it all leads back to one inevitable truth: THESE FUNDS NEED NEED NEED SHARES to cover up whatever it is they're trying to hide.  This is not a regular short squeeze and nothing about it feels normal.  Not financial advice. I just really like this stock, I can't help it.  EDIT: Look at my link to yahoo   look at Short % of Float (Jan 15, 2021) =      CNBC and Bloomberg constantly telling us shorts have already covered and squeeze is over. That would mean that in the last 2 weeks, shorts would have had to cover over close to 90M shares. I think someone would have noticed that.
Why is no one talking about short volume as a percent of total volume?
GME's short sales have been more than 50% of its total volume for the last 4 days straight, meaning that short interest has necessarily been increasing, despite what S3/Ortex are saying. See:    (FINRA data for today tell the same story:     Given that short interest has been increasing and the price is still as high as it is, I could see the 3/19 big money calls bought today as capitulation to our retardation. Big money puts expire on Friday at 235. My guess is it's a tough battle around 235 until Friday, and then sometime before 3/19 it'll sail above 800.

Short ladder for smoothest brains
You and Karen tell your Boss you are going to buy all the houses in Green Meadows Eden (GME) because it is the only place that Boss can build a lithium mine and Boss sold millions of contracts for Lithium that he NEEDS to deliver.  You and Karen start buying houses at fair market value and selling them again for 10% less than fair market value. Residents see housing values fall and panic, and think they need to sell to avoid being the last worthless house. You and Karen keep buying and selling the same set of houses at cheaper and cheaper prices. Some paper handed idiots sell their grandpa‚Äôs farm because FMV keeps tanking.  If the ladder attack is successful you and Karen buy all the houses on the cheap because you NEED them and you successfully tanked the housing market in GME.  If you and Karen are the smoothest brains in the world, people catch on, buy the houses you are discounting for cheaper and cheaper and you need to offer more and more and more to buy the property because everyone realized you NEEDED the houses and some retail autist bought the houses you were trying to tank on the cheap.  Eventually, after paying a shit ton of closing costs (Interest) on the houses you are making no progress in buying the actual property you need and you need to start paying the inflated housing values for the property.  If people panic and sell on the cheap, win for HF. If people laugh and say suck it Melvin, then the property price rises and you get paid.  Should Karen win?
Continuing DD wrt SEC Violations and Market Manipulation
Compiling some research, post not complete but being used to collect the SEC regulations that appear to have been violated based on all the GME shenanigans. This builds upon the work by u/johnnydaggers and others, cited at the end, that   EVERYONE should read.    Feel free to   use this info ANYWHERE  , and   KEEP FUCKING BUILDING ON IT,   and certainly correct it,   just cite the people that are doing the DD!       Now buckle up as I take you through the exhilarating world that is SEC regulations with regards to short selling and market manipulation as provided by the   Securities and Exchange Commission!        Rule 201 ‚Äì Short Sale Price Test Circuit Breaker   \ \ .\ \      Requires trading centers to establish, maintain,    and  enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to  prevent the execution or display of a short sale at an impermissible price when a stock has triggered a circuit breaker by experiencing  a    price decline of at least 10 percent in one day.    Once the circuit  breaker in Rule 201 has been triggered, the price test restriction     will  app     ly to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day      and the following day,   unless an exception applies.      Rule 203(b)(1) and (2) ‚Äì Locate Requirement .  Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have   reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed   so that it can be delivered on  the date delivery is due before effecting a short sale order in any  equity security.[\    This ‚Äúlocate‚Äù must be made and documented prior to effecting the short sale.    # Did brokers have a place where they "reasonably" believed they could get the shares from?  # Answer: FUCK NO     [Figure 2: Screen shot from AlphaRRCapital as shown in u\/monarchy8822 post \     Rule 204 ‚Äì Close-out Requirement.   Rule 204 requires brokers and dealers that are participants of a registered clearing agency[\  remains in effect.  # So, is GME a "threshold security" as defined by the SEC here:    Outstanding Shares of GME:     \~ 69,750,000     of Outstanding GME Shares = \~300,000   "aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days" = 2,351,180   Is   million >   of Outstanding GME Shares   AND   is   million > 10,000 shares?  # Yea, it fucking is!  # Well, then they stopped issuing shorts until the previous ones closed position and settled, right..... RIGHT?!     [Figure 3: Plot and Analysis of GME FTD's from  u\/billyatlava post\   #              FUCK NO they didn't quit giving out shorts!  #             THEY WERE LIKE FUCKING OPRAH WITH SHORTS!  But all the shorts are covered now right? News person says GME shorts all done, go home, buy shiny things that HF's own.....     #          WRONG ASSHOLE! 226% SHORT INTEREST TODAY!  #        But how could they violate Regulation SHO Rules 201-204 you might ask? Aren't they're measure's in place after what happened in 2008/2009 to prevent that from ever happening?    # BECAUSE SIMPLE MINDED RETAIL INVESTOR!  (   go invest in silver)  I'm still reading through it myself, and make corrections and add to it as you see fit, but it seems that there have been violations of   SHO Rules 201,203, and 204. PLEASE CONTINUE TO DO THE DD and USE MINE and OTHERS posts to DO THE FUCKING SEC's JOB FOR THEM!!!!!       # IN CONCLUSION, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!!!!!       TLDR;    1. NO SHORTS should have been executed Thursday when GME dropped down to $132 because it fell more than 10%, or any of the other fucking days!!!! 2. No new shorts should have been issued because there's no reasonable belief that they could find actual stock to lend given 140% short float as reported from December, and I doubt they secured it PRIOR to issuing new stock 3. They should have already executed the failed to deliver shorts ASAP because of the high number of FTD's and the high number of shorted shares     \[1\]  "The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation" by u/johnnydaggers     \[2\]  "From u/AlphaRRCapital1 on Twitter.

$FUBO DD - This stock could moon
Please Note:     This is for those of you who are not all-in on GME and like to look at alternatives. Not saying sell GME to buy FUBO, just saying there are other interesting alternatives out there, and FUBO is one of them. Also, it's heavily shorted.      \-   Share Facts -        FuboTV, ticker FUBO       IV:   Around 200% this morning on puts expiring Feb-12th     FUBO earnings date:   Estimated to be Feb 5th     Share Float:     (as per       Short % of Float:     (as of Jan 15th, as per        I mention this because FUBO was heavily shorted when the stock rose in the $60‚Äôs, and unfortunately shorters succeeded in crashing the price.     Market Cap:   $  B    My position      38 shares @ approx. $31   100 shares @ approx $43 bought this morning, and sold a covered call at $55 strike for $  for Feb-12th. I'm sure I'll regret it, but the yield on both the call itself, and the potential yield if I get called away for downright phenomenal, hard to turn down.       - The DD -      What is FuboTV?    Mama Wood said it herself (paraphrasing here): Cable is dying, to hell with cable, we want MOAR STREAMING!!!!!!!!!  Seriously, cable and television plans are dying. Nowadays you have a ton of flexible solutions, from the obvious Netflix and YouTube, to Amazon Prime, Sling TV, Hulu, etc. FUBO is capitalizing on this trend for sports fans. It is the country's first sports-first service. While the price might seem steep, it gives you access to dozens of regional, national and international sports channels, including live events in 4K HDR.  Beyond sports, it offers much more; 112 channels in total, including 43 of the top 50 Nielson-rated networks (for you autists and retards out there, Nielson is an American information, data and market measurement firm operating in over 100 countries and employing 44,000 people (says Wikipedia, I‚Äôm too retarded to do more research on them).   non-sports related channels on FUBO include: A&E, Adult Swim, AMC, BBC America, Bravo, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, etc. Yes, they even have the Weather Network.    Recent acquisitions:    No DD of a hyper fast growing company would be complete without discussing acquisitions.      Vigtory:   The company is in the process of acquiring and integrating Vigtory Inc to the platform. Vigtory is a sportsbook (sports betting). It will also remain available to those not using FuboTV (aka: additional revenues, but also additional marketing for FuboTV)     Balto:   Balto develops tools for users to organize and play fantasy sports games, and FuboTV intends to combine its technology with Balto to launch a free-to-play gaming offering.    Some numbers (yes, the quant stuff):    Average revenue per user (ARPU) has gone from $  per month in 2019, to $  in 2019, and to $  in the latest quarter. In contrast, it‚Äôs average monthly cost per user has risen from $  in 2018 to $  in the last quarter. Yes, they were obviously operating at a loss, and yes they are now operating at a positive contribution profit. As of the latest quarter, they had 455,000 paid subcribers. Grand news, yes?    Q3 results, and guidance for Q4:    Spoiler alert: The numbers are fantastic.    Q3: Revenues of $  million, an increase of close to 50% on a YoY basis.      Breaking revenues down: Subscription revenues up by 64% at $  million, and advertising revenues up by 153% at $  million      Paid subscribers increased by 58% on a YoY basis, and ARPU increased by 14% on a YOY basis.  . Sexy, ain‚Äôt it?      Hours spent watching FuboTV also skyrocketed, an increase of 83% YoY (  million hours). Monthly Active Users watched on average 120h per month. This is a 20% increase YoY   Q4 guidance: Spoiler alert: They raised their guidance mid quarter because they are so bloody awesome      Q4 revenue to be expected between $94 to $98 million, prior guidance was $80 to $85 million. The new guidance represents a 77% to 84% YoY revenue increase      Paid subscribers to be expected to exceed 545,000, prior guidance was 500k to 510k. The new guidance represents a 72% YoY increase.    What now?    Sure, they are not profitable yet. Big whoop, they are still young, FuboTV was founded in 2015. But you know what? It took ages for Netflix to become profitable (about 7 or 8 years, I believe). The way FUBO is growing their paid subscribers base, and the way the hours are increasing YoY, we can expect them to reach profitability sooner rather than later. When? I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball, if I do I‚Äôd be a billionaire. We can expect that as they continue to scale up and add more users, they will continue to increase their advertisement revenues (duh), and also that their cost of new client acquisition will become lower (also duh)    What are the risks?      For FUBO to thrive and grow, they need live sports. COVID dented their growth due to professional sports suspending seasons. If we go into another massive lockdown (less and less likely as vaccines ever so slowly roll out), this could cause another dent in their growth.   It‚Äôs still heavily shorted, as the price continues to go up (especially if they smash their guidance), expect some shady shit GME-style from hedge funds to bring the price down.    TLDR:   Awesome growth potential, heavily shorted (not at the GME scale, but still heavily shorted so you need to be mindful of that and potential WSB attention to the stock, or potential shady business from shorters).    Edit:

XL Fleet short interest increased from 50% to 72% in the latest reporting (came out Friday)  $XL Fleet only has   shares of public float Of that,   are institutionally owned (  not going to be sold anytime soon)  That means there are roughly   shares of true float available. At   shares, it only takes 76,000 call option contracts that are in the money (the strike is less below the current trading price) to lock up the ENTIRE FLOAT.  Notice how the OI spikes MASSIVELY on the C25 and C30, with a decent bit at C20 and        There are already nearly 40,000 contracts that are In The Money. Locking up 4M shares.  Total, there are over 144k option contracts that have been sold.  This will fly again personal PT short term 27.

Ocean's GME: The Biggest Heist in History
BUY AND HOLD COMRADES! DOING MY SMALL BIT.. THE REST IS TIED INTO AMC
My first amateur WSB loss porn!
I hope as a community we can respect /u/DeepFuckingValue's decision if/when he decides to sell $GME and not flip out on a guy who's never once said he's planning to hold till the end of time.
I feel like with /u/deepfuckingvalue being positioned as the figurehead of the $GME movement and the 'if he is still in I'm still in' crowd that some people may feel betrayed if he decided to sell his whole position and take profits.  Just remember that when DFV was buying $GME at prices as low as $4 per share he wasn't signing up for the 'diamond hands never sell' club and he never got into the play for reasons like smashing hedge funds, curing cancer etc. That stuff has all come about from us and people jumping on the bandwagon.  WSB before this crazy week that has changed the sub forever was all about taking on risk to try and make money fast. DFV has achieved that on a scale we haven't seen before and if he decides to take profits we should support him doing so and not get upset that it may affect the price etc or say he betrayed a cause he never signed up for.  If you've watched the guys youtube you will know he's an extremely nice and likeable guy, would hate to see people calling him judas or whatever if he decides to sell.
THE VW SQUEEZE CHART THAT IS BEING CIRCULATED IS PRICED IN GERMAN CURRENCY, NOT US DOLLARS...
So I finally decided to go look at the Volkswagen squeeze for myself.  And I‚Äôm kind of shocked. Nobody mentioned that the circulating chart of the ‚ÄúVW squeeze chart‚Äù is actually priced in German currency.   If you look at the American stock ticker chart, yes the price squeezed, BUT it only squeezed from 20 dollars to $116...   I‚Äôm just saying we might have actually been squeezed already. We went from 20 bucks to $500.   I know the shorts still haven‚Äôt ‚Äúcovered‚Äù, possibly... But no one looked into the fact that the numbers are totally off.   No one will read this but whatever.

MODS PLEASE DON'T DELETE - Serious comment about discussing legality of GME shorts!
I've seen so many posts talking about whether what these hedge funds are doing is legal, whether they're legally required to eat their losses, etc. This community needs to understand something:  For these hedge funds, LEGALITY IS IRRELEVANT.  ALL THAT MATTERS IS PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL.  Capital buys politicians, regulators (Yellen) and lawyers to delay and diminish any possible consequences.  Capital means dodging $100 billion in losses today in exchange for a $100 million fine a year from now.  Batten down the hatches and expect this fight to continue.  No one went to jail in '08 for destroying the economy. It's highly likely no one is going to jail for this.  Don't expect s\ \ \  from our legal system.  We will prevail, but don't expect a quick outcome.   Edit: switched to lower case :)

How to give Robinhood a Red Dildo (hint: don't go the class action route for max pain).
Dear WSB brethren,     I  hate seeing the big players donkey fuck the market when their trades go tits up, and screw over the good guys. We all know that any sort of legal proceedings against Robinhood will go absolutely nowhere except maybe some heavy fines and more regulation that will handcuff retail traders more. If you were affected by Robinhood in anyway, and want to stick them with a big red dildo and go Sheriff Nottingham on them... ARBITRATION!     Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS) used to mandate Class-Action arbitration. Then in 2005, Big Tech arranged to remove that caveat so they could do super shady shit (and save on legal fees). It's pure idiocy, but it helps us out.  Read more here:       Here is Robinhoods User Agreement (Please screen grab this yourselves as companies have been known to modify it in the wake of arbitration proceedings..Patreon i'm looking at you) :  38. Arbitration.     A. This Agreement contains a pre-dispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration agreement, the parties agree as follows: (1) All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration forum in which a claim is filed. (2) Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. (3) The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. (4) The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award unless, in an eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. (5) The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are affiliated with the securities industry. (6) The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in court. (7) The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments thereto, shall be incorporated into this Agreement.   B. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other agreement between Me and Robinhood, any Account(s) established hereunder, any transaction therein, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of FINRA Dispute Resolution, Inc. ("FINRA DR"). I agree to arbitrate any controversy or claim before FINRA DR in the State of California.   C. This agreement to arbitrate constitutes a waiver of the right to seek a judicial forum unless such a waiver would be void under the federal securities laws. If I am a foreign national, non-resident alien, or if I do not reside in the United States, I agree to waive My right to file an action against Robinhood in any foreign venue. D. No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration, nor seek to enforce any pre-dispute arbitration agreement against any person who has initiated in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class action until: (1) the class certification is denied; or (2) the class is decertified; or (3) the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under this Agreement except to the extent stated herein.     This is where it gets good... California State Law (CCP   if your following) states that in arbitration, consumers only pay for the initial filing fee.    Robinhood pays all remaining fees.     CCP    "(a) No neutral arbitrator or private arbitration company shall administer a consumer arbitration under any agreement or rule requiring that a consumer who is a party to the arbitration pay the fees and costs incurred by an opposing party if the consumer does not prevail in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fees and costs of the arbitrator, provider organization, attorney, or witnesses."  Full Law:        Other takeaway there is that FINRA has no rules to declare a arbitration "frivolous". The right to file is protected by the Federal Arbitration Act, and favorable Supreme Court rulings protecting filings as well.   .     If the millions of Robinhood users were to file for arbitration, they could not do it as a class action per California State Law. They MUST file individually. Robinhood would have to pay for arbitration individually. This would cost them hundreds of millions of dollars, and there's nothing they can do about it. They took money out of your pocket so now take money out of theirs.     Respectfully signed,  A stupid retail trader          TL;DR    \ Robinhood User Agreement has a gaping hole in it. If you were financially harmed by their fuckery, file for arbitration.  \ State law prohibits class-action arbitration  \ Robinhood pays all costs except filing fees  \ Maybe you win and get tendies.  \ This could cost them a metric fuckton of money  \ Apes Strong Together       Disclaimer; I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. Consult with a lawyer before you any take legal action.    Positions: GME til I die/ Purple Gang     PS I miss you u/fuzzyblankeet  Please come back

They say Robinhood stopped its users from buying GME because of requirement with Clearinghouse
So now that the bleeding has stopped and the frenzy has subsided, there are fund managers, articles, and former TD Ameritrade CEO coming out on CNBC giving reasons why Robinhood halted trading for GME and other stocks.   Let's just go over the order of events that happened and the "not so subtle" incentives behind this. Yesterday, in the clubhouse video chat, Elon Musk called out Vlad Tenev on this. He replied by saying something along the lines of "regulatory requirement" and to protect the users, etc. The most egregious thing he said was he didn't want to halt trading altogether so he stopped buying only to protect Robinhood and the Clearinghouse. There is some credibility to this logic but the way the events unfolded is suspicious and it is clear that this was not the thought process at the time of the decision and it was after the fact they came up with this to try to explain the real reason.  First of all, who benefits from halting the buying only? Hedgefunds. I think we would have all been upset but we would not have been "harmed" if Robinhood halted trading for GME completely. If RH halted GME trading altogether until they secured more funding to meet requirements, then I would have believed the excuse they gave - that they put restrictions to meet regulatory requirements.     TLDR: RH halted buying that only benefited hedge funds and harmed retail investors that bought into GME and then after the fact, they came out and said regulatory requirements.     If you really didn't have any ulterior motive, then why didn't RH warn us or give us a heads up? This was not a instant phenomenon. It was inevitable event that was building up over days. The volume was picking up and everyone knew what was going on. Are you seriously trying to tell me that all the people are RH had no idea about these deposit or regulatory requirements until 11:00 AM of the day? Did they have to suddenly put these restrictions mid-day and directly cause a massive price drop in GME?  Why couldn't they give these reasons at the time of halting trading?   It's clear at this point - Vlad Tenev risked jail time to put restrictions on trading that only benefited hedge funds and directly harmed retail investors that already had money in GME.   I do not support RH and this CEO should be investigated.

Ever heard the term divide and conquer? They won today because you retards kept focusing your energy in the wrong place.

Fake News, Hedge Funds and why the media is a bunch of butt pirates
So what the fuck is going on right?   Thursday (28th Jan): MM's/HF's executed a clear ladder attack - trading large stock holdings between each other, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off. Was there really?   Fuck no.   Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we   HOLD  ? Obviously.  In the hours and day following their attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us Ape's sold!  The cock jockeys at Wall Street have now had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Tried to hype SLV to distract and used media contacts to alter the story. What they are now doing is using a similar form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay.   In other words they will try to keep the stock stagnant.   I wouldn't be surprised to seem them lever the price UP, to raise hopes only to ladder DOWN again to again alter the "squeeze" story.  They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our positions (obligatory fuck RobinHood & IBKR).    \ \ THE IMPORTANT PART:\ \                No matter what people say or what you hear in the media - THEY CANNOT CLOSE POSITIONS UNLESS SOMEONE SELLS. Simple as that. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares (\[1\]). Bottom line.  Now with this said please fucking read this:   (\[1\])   TLDR:  "the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before!     THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!"     Short float is clearly not the be all and end all. Do not fall into this trap.     I hope new retards that just joined WSB realise that this struggle between Retail Investors & Hedge Funds may take longer than you think.    No one knows when (or fucking IF) the short squeeze will take place as expected. Be ready to HOLD for 2-3 weeks or even longer. We may have the an upper hand, but the hedge funds aren't stupid. They have been taking your boomer parents\  hard earned money for decades so be ready for several weeks of FUD, misinformation, and restrictions. Don't invest more than what you can lose. Be logical, go out, exercise, eat and sleep (stop looking at that fucking line 24/7). Try not to stay glued to the screen.  Helmets on. Cheers to remaining space-cadets together.                           \ \ This is not financial advice, I‚Äôm just a retard who can Google shit\ \      Positions: 69   Reverse Cowgirl   x90 GME @ $40

Crazy.  Guys we need to jump back on gme.  Holding together is the only chance we have of ever getting anything done da  it!!! I just joined today but been watching for over a week.  This isn't about stupid jokes it's about getting back at the thieves that rob America every day! If we hold this up long enough the rest of the world will follow.  We have the world's attention and you are going to let the SLV trolls take it away???  If we can do this we can change the world.  Hedge funds will be at their knees for us, and deservedly so.    Buy GME. Hold GME  Whatever you do I'm going to keep going.  We literally are capable of changing the country for the better. I might be an idealistic retard but the alternative is to sulk back into the basement and let's the Hedgers destroy the country.  Come on guys!  Please!!!

New York Times Stock, Thoughts and feelings. Not financial advice. First I will wait to end my GME position as I need more cash.
Hey, guys I just remembered earlier today that New York Times was publicly traded (ticker NYT). After doing some basic fundamental analysis I have personally concluded that the company was overvalued, relative to its current share price. I am not a financial advisor and would recommend every do their own due diligence.   Once I can personally free up some capital from other stocks I like, such as GME, I will be looking into taking a net short position or obtain put contracts on NYT.  I of course wouldn't be too interested in NYT just yet.   One of the key reasons I believe NYT is overvalued currently is because their business model is clearly failing. Revenue is going to crap. Here are a couple of headlines that demonstrate such bad business practices... remember I just don't like the stock              Another interesting topic of discussion could be even better ways that we get net short exposure to the industry as a whole. How could this be possible?? I just don't like most of the stocks fundamentally. that simple boy...

Prediction: Robinhood is raising their GME limit only to lower it abruptly and screw everyone again
A lot of people are excited that Robinhood increased the GME share limit to 20. Well you shouldn't be. The might raise it again to 50 or 100 or remove the limit entirely. But then they will sweep the rug from under you to replicate last Thursday's crash, don't forget the hedge funds are their real customers.  You NEED to switch to Fidelity or Vanguard if you don't want to get fucked by Robinhood again. Because they WILL fuck you again at the strategically worst time for you and best time for their real customers the hedge funds.  Don't let them fool you a second time.
Oh lawd please send it. $NOK
$FUBO may be the next best squeeze target after $GME.
At least 70% short interest.   Increased guidance.      Outperform and PT ($50) increase by wed bush.   322% 52-wk return. Have a legit business in sports media and are rapidly rolling out their sports betting platform.  The sentiment and analysts opinions seems to be rather bullish considering the amount of shorts.  I think we might have a sleeping giant here.   This isn‚Äôt a struggling business being heavily shorted.  This is something that already has a reason for a higher valuation but can get squeezed far higher.  $GME had the same elements.  Lots of shorts on a business that wasn‚Äôt hurting as bad as people thought.

The truth behind media shilling and taking advantage of the ladder attacks
Repost from a post I made in another thread. Not looking for awards - I'm looking for this knowledge/idea to get out there.   So a lot of the newbies and paper hands are getting spooked by the decreasing price, but it's not a bad thing because the volume of stocks traded are the same. At the end of the day, those stocks are owed to investors by the short-sellers irrespective of the price. The fact that there are virtually no stocks to be traded apart from the ones being traded to each other (  inducing ladder attacks) is where the problem lies for them.  That is the key point; hedges still need to buy the stocks to close their over-shorted positions. A low price is instrumental in allowing people to buy stocks back and will enable those who missed the first spike to get back into the game. With everyone being able to buy stocks at a lower price, we may have the firepower needed to re-commence the buying of stocks and finally induce the MOASS due to their heavily shorted positions.    THIS IS WHY THE NEWS IS SO ADAMANT ON SAYING THE REDDIT ARMY HAS MOVED ON; THEY DO NOT WANT INVESTORS TO BUY IN AT A LOWER PRICE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ROYALLY SCREWED  . All their efforts will have been in vein and there will be even MORE longed stocks that are owed, thanks to investors who bough at that dip. This is why it is important to hold.

Do you want level 2 data? Did you switch to fidelity? Here's how to use active trader pro to do just that.
Honestly, I have no idea wtf this is but I am capable of learning to tie my shoes, and I find this all very entertaining.  Honestly though, is this level 2 data?  Idk.  It tells you that bid/ask stuff that everyone keeps talking about.  1) Go here:    Download it and log in.  2) Once you've logged in go to layouts > new layout.  Here you'll create a new chart, a find your position, link it to level 2 data and get a real time quote- just like that, wow.   3) Create a new chart to monitor GME.  Here you can modify it however you want.     4) Add a directed trade & extended hours tab.     5) We'll link the chart to the directed trade & extended hours tab.    I like blue because it makes me feel better.  6) Add a real time quote, and link that with blue.  You can just do this by right clicking on the little chart button next to the field.     7) Now go to account > positions and pull up your beautiful GME holding.  Then right click on GME, and go to find holding in all accounts.     8) Link that with blue.     Now you have the chart, the position you have, the streaming data, and a real time quote all in one.  Since they're linked you can switch them.  Again I just like pretty numbers, I have no idea what's going on and you should definitely not listen to me for financial advice- but it allows you to keep track just a weee bit better.   Obligatory fuck Robinhood.

F\ ck away from silver, you don't deserve it. No, retards, I am not a bot, go check my profile.

I am one of the silverBugs you are accusing in being a hedgie bot. No, I am not trying to steal your GME gains. If something, after RH blocked your selling ability, I opened WeBull account and bought a shitty GME stock to show support to you. But fuck you, after reading dozens of "fuck silver" comments I am fed up. But still wanna let you know what was going on with silver "bots" calling you to take on silver.   It just happened so, that for a second, we, the silver bugs, saw a potential ally in you, a force that could help us liberate silver from the banking cabal and actually change something in our society. But you, small brain, paranoiac apes, just didn't get it. No, we didn't say go buy SLV, we said buy physical and collapse the fucking fraud that JP Morgan and the Fed had been pulling on our nation for decades. And, yes it is possible, all was needed to buy few ounces of the shinny and show some support to our cause. Ah... whatever, go play your GME, good luck to you.

Bearish $GME Fails-To-Deliver data for 1H January
So the SEC has published fails-to-deliver data for 2021-01-1H, and it doesn't look great for the bull case for $GME.  Here's some background information on what this means:    The SEC publishes bi-monthly data on Fails-To-Deliver -    Here's the data rolled up into something you can actually read:  ALL of December 2020 -    1H January 2021 -    I'll let people smarter than me offer interpretations, but fails-to-deliver appears to be  decreasing  over time, which I think would be consistent with shorts covering their positions.

Response engagements of this scale typically take weeks if not months. So we might be looking at meeting Q4 estimates but raising Q1 guidance.  Even without a beat, I‚Äôll take this as a bullish sign.   I‚Äôve been watching job openings at FireEye for the last month.  They‚Äôve been recruiting non-stop and a large portion of these at Incident Response or other services consultants. There are currently 192 open roles.    Back of the napkin calculations are... many of the senior roles will be sent immediately into the field at a billing rate between $250-$450. At a 80% utilization that is between $400k-$720k per head per year. If they have hired between 50-100 people into these roles since the Solarwinds hack that is could lead to $20M-$36M revenue increase on the low end to $40M-$72M on the high end. With current annual revenues at $928M we could see an annual revenue increase of 7% on these services alone which is above their current   revenue growth rate. If we see acceleration in any of their newish businesses like Managed Defense and Mandiant Advantage Cyber Threat Intelligence services we could have a great growth story on our hands. Incident Response services are (hopefully) a one time thing for breached companies but Managed Defense and Intel services are a recurring revenue stream, so growth in these areas would be a very good thing indeed.   Any upticks in the hardware business would be positive news, but I believe they are facing upgrade cycle challenges and I‚Äôm not expecting much on this front.   Finally, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we saw FEYE acquired by a larger player in the next few months. There have been multiple rounds of rumors over the last few years that indicate FEYE has hired an investment bank to assist with the process. While Mandia hasn‚Äôt confirmed these rumors, he hasn‚Äôt denied them either. Cisco allegedly passed. I think good candidates are Microsoft, IBM or even someone like CrowdStrike using their astronomically high share price to swing a deal and create a cyber powerhouse to rival Pali Alto.    I‚Äôm long with shares, considering NTM/OTM LEAPS, might by some June calls.  FD weeklies might payout but are risky IMO.
Does DFV believe the squeeze is squoze?
Down 7K but HOLDING STRONG!!
Does Robinhood actually have the GME shares?
Does RH really have the shares? I asked in the GME thread if anyone executed their contracts on Friday, and a user reported that he got delivery but was unable to write covered calls, sell, etc.  If a bunch of RH users used the loophole to buy and execute calls, and including the users who exercised their ITM calls, how can RH deliver on all of these shares? Why would RH limit buying 1 share, but now we have contracts being executed for 100 shares? I thought there needed to be 100% funds at DTC?  I don't fully understand this, but wanted to ask because maybe one of you autists could figure this out.  EDIT: Has anyone been able to successfully transfer out an account with a lot of GME shares?
DONT DOUBT THE SQUEEZE
Think about it.   -Why are they sending hoards of bots to this sub to spam misinformation?  -Look at the subs growth, you think that‚Äôs organic?  -Why is the media suddenly ‚Äútaking‚Äù the Silver bait? And spamming silver news nonstop.   -why do people on /r/stocks and /r/investing keep saying the squeeze already happened?  -if the squeeze already happened, why did robinhood and many other apps block buying $GME recently?  -why are there bots spamming the same comment on every thread?   -why are so many people here with no history of investing, suddenly coming out of inactivity after MONTHS to post FUD here?   Whenever you start doubting whether the short squeeze already happened ask yourself all of these. It‚Äôs alright to be skeptical, but all the signs are in front of us.   They would never be putting in so much effort if the squeeze already happened. If it did, it would be us against ourselves, and they wouldn‚Äôt give a shit. But it‚Äôs still us against them. That‚Äôs why all this bullshit is getting bigger and bigger.  TL;DR THE SQUEEZE DIDNT HAPPEN YET AND MANY ‚ÄúPEOPLE‚Äù TRY TO CONVINCE YOU IT DID SO YOU WOULD SELL   $GME         ü§≤   ü§≤
GME is a long battle!!! Must read article
Please Read       ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look like there will be a pause in GameStop‚Äôs stock price volatility, as both the long and short side should remain active. The short side may be covering at the moment, but they can turn on a dime and resume short-selling as stock loan availability from previous short covers hits the market. If long-side buying turns into profit-taking, new short sellers may jump back into the fray and help push GME stock prices down.‚Äù  EDIT  Now another article      IHS Markit, another credible market intelligence firm, estimates $GME short interest has collapsed to 39% (from 114%) supporting S3‚Äôs estimates.

Confused About The GameStop Stock Situation? Here‚Äôs An Explainer We Plagiarized Wholesale From Polygon Because We Don‚Äôt Get It Either
Seeing lot of people doing that, selling at 5K , if it sell , I‚Äôll buy back in :)
ICLN is a strong hold under President BUYDEN
ICLN is an etf that holds a lot of green energy stocks - a lot of $PLUG power as well. It has been growing steadily thus far and I know it will grow a lot more into 2021 with Biden putting up a lot of money into green energy.   Here's a list of things Biden is doing for green energy, which will ultimately push ICLN upwards :  1. Joining the Paris Climate Agreement 2. Cancelling the Keystone Oil Pipeline 3.  Biden will invest $400 billion over ten years, as one part of a broad mobilization of public investment, in clean energy and innovation. That investment is twice the investment of the Apollo program which put a man on the moon, in today‚Äôs dollars. He will also establish ARPA-C, a new research agency focused on accelerating climate technologies.¬†  4. Biden will set a target of reducing the carbon footprint of the   building stock 50% by 2035, creating incentives for deep retrofits that combine appliance electrification, efficiency, and on-site clean power generation. He will work with our nation‚Äôs governors and mayors to support the deployment of more than 500,000 new public charging outlets by the end of 2030. And, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone.  5.  Biden will require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and the greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and supply chains. In his first year, he‚Äôll work to enact legislation requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. But that‚Äôs not all: Biden will direct his EPA and Justice Department to pursue these cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and, when needed, seek additional legislation to hold corporate executives personally accountable ‚Äì including jail time when merited. Allowing corporations to continue to pollute ‚Äì affecting the health and safety of both their workers and surrounding communities ‚Äì without consequences perpetuates an egregious abuse of power. These companies must be accountable to the American people, the communities where they operate, and the workers they employ.  6.  Every federal dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden Administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of this climate crisis. American workers should build American infrastructure and manufacture all the materials that go into it, and all of these workers must have the option to join a union and collectively bargain. Biden will ensure his   incorporates labor provisions so federal investments create millions of middle-class jobs, benefiting workers across industries.¬†   All of this is straight from his website. Since ICLN is an etf and does not swing ( A good thing IMO ) it is an extremely good candidate for buying shares.  But since we like to live on the edge, the best thing for us to do would be to buy ATM or ITM options that expire a long time from now.   Position : 1 ICLN 30c exp 1/21/2021 ( Can only afford 1. I am a student and rest is in GME )

WSB Is Like Different Season's In A Year
For all the people who are complaining about how WSB has changed since the influx of 6-7 million new retards, there is nothing to worry about. This is just like a new toy WSB has found, only thing is we have more retards than before so the noise is even more.   This sub was all over PLTR in the month of December, STEEL for like 2 weeks. Any one  who questioned  Don Vito was downvoted to hell.  April/May of 2020 was all about SPY puts and VIX and the entire sub was bearing in nature. Because of this tons of money was lost and people missed the huge runs of various tech companies.    We have these cycles every year, In the month of Nov/Dec we were complaining about the new influx of 800k-1M of retards that joined since Summer.   Now were are complaining about another 6-7 million more   If there is 1 good    month, they new retards will leave and we will get our sub back, where people find new plays and crazy ideas even more.    Positions : PLTR, Cleveland Cliff, GME, GOEV        Not a financial advise, if you follow you are even more retarded and stupid.
Brothers, I WANT TO BELIEVE -- please bring back my faith
I know you future-qanon-retards-in-the-making are going to vote this shit down but I'm losing my fucking faith here. I still hold a "small" position of 300 shares after taking some profits, so I want it to rocket as much as you, but I just don't have any fucking idea what is true and what is not true.  A lot of this is because the shit I read clearly indicates a lot of you are actual autists that have no fucking clue what anything is and just parraot "gamma squeeze", "naked shorting", "ladder attacks", "MSM cover up", "still 18000% floated", and other shit that I'm not even on the loop of.  On the flip side, I didn't know wtf a gamma squeeze was two weeks ago, have no idea how to detect naked shorting or not so maybe you're right... (fuck I don't even know  who  does the naked shorting -- the brokers, right? so the HFs are in bed with the brokers? or the brokers lying to HFs? IDFK), I just learned about ladder attacks a week ago (I thought it was called painting the tape), I believe MSM are idiots but are they covering up, and I have no fucking clue how much the short interest is and at what price targets shorts got in at.  Suffice it to say, who am I tell to you you are wrong?  I am just utterly fucking confused. I can't even finish this post. I don't know what I want.  I guess please just give me some reasons why GME will still moon that don't rely on conspiratorial or unproveable things.. (and if they do, give me some sources).  Fuck man I've lost my way  Edit: getting a lot of good leads on responses hopefully I can get some faith back. thanks for not being complete assholes
Rough day, loss porn. Bruised but not broken
The response I sent to Robinhood after they emailed me to explain why they had to ‚Äútake action‚Äù on certain stocks.
$GME I was told to buy in on the dips. Am I playing correctly?
You don‚Äôt have to buy to squeeze tighter...transfer the shares off robinhood
Pretty well known robinhood lends out securities without telling you or giving you a cut of the  ‚Äôs a good chance your own shares are the ones being shorted.  If robinhood lent your shares, and you bought them back again, then their running low and will have to call the shares borrowed, and could force shorts to cover if they can‚Äôt find another borrow  You could go to shwab, Meryl, Webull or whoever. Just make sure it‚Äôs an account that will let you know if it lends your shares. If they don‚Äôt have a borrow they have to cover. And that brings upward price movement  Edit - someone brought up an important point. Don‚Äôt get all your shares locked up at once. This works just space them out over time if this goes on for a while. The risk is however many you move at once are locked up
WSB can speed up path for lung cancer cure, $TAK
Yeah i know this sounds like clickbait or some bs but $TAK Is one of cathie woods biggest holding, i stated that first because people love her and hope that makes people pay attention. Tak is also one of the leading company in world for the process of discovering cures for cancer . Guess what they are also pretty strongly  shorted and Ceo has stated that they need further cash for more clinical trials. 2k in April 25$ calls will turn out to 10k if it‚Äôs in the money. Really cheap play here. bringing some real attention to a stock like this has nothing but positives.   "This company is old as shit" (240 years to be exact), and "Fuck Biopharmaceuticals/Biotech companies, I've always gotten burned" Well, after what's transpired with $GME and $BB gang, we know that no matter what, an "old" company can have a big future if they set themselves up correctly with a competitive advantage. AND stop trying to play earnings/binary events and just buy and hold shares. Less stress, less autism, guaranteed money if the business is solid.  How Did this Company Catch My Eye?  Simply put, because of our GILF and Savior, Cathie Woods. So how does Mama Woods play into this? If you subscribe to ARK's trade notifications (I only started as of 12/15/20), take a look at how often TAK appears as a "BUY" since the beginning of December 2020 for their ARKG ETF.

Why $VALE (Vale SA) is a buy.
$VALE is a mining company (one of the largest in the world. They specialize in mining Iron Ore, Nickel, Manganese, Coal, and Copper. It has huge upside with the potential to 10x at a moment's notice.  20% of Analysts rank it as a Strong Buy  80% of Analysts rank it as a Buy  However, the price targets are not the high, why? They have been fined 2 billion dollars by the Brazilian government over a collapsed dam, but that doesn't really matter in the short term does it.  $VALE produces Nickel and Copper which are fundamental to battery production, and it just so happens there is a worldwide shortage on Nickel which is fundamental to battery production. The EV market continues to expand, and with continued growth more and more nickel is needed to meet demand.  So why the huge upside potential?  One Answer: Papa Elon  Elon Musk has said a number of times that Tesla will give sustainable mining companies a large agreement. I believe that the time for a large Tesla contract is soon, and VALE in my opinion is most likely to receive the contract. If this were to happen I would not doubt a price jump of 10x immediately to fall and stay steady at 5x at around $80-$100 a share similar evaluation to $CAT in the short term, and if battery production continues at exponential growth I could this becoming a trillion dollar company by 2030.  Let me know your thoughts. Do you think I am right or just a retard redditor?  Edit: I have also seen a large order volume for 2/19 21C if that is any indicator of anything, perhaps insider knowledge. I am unsure, but these are just my observations.  Edit 2: Earnings are the day after tomorrow and there's always a possibility of an earnings surprise.

Let's leave the propaganda and conspiracies out of this and pretend we have wrinkley brains for just a minute. Let's practice some critical thinking.
In all this commotion, a few glaring questions remains.  I've noticed these questions are repeatedly being addressed and answered with grand conspiracies that implicate major legal and ethical improprieties.  First off, CNBC and now other news networks have been reporting since last week that Melvin closed their position.  This sub has repeatedly stated that this is fake news and Melvin trying to manipulate markets.  People in this sub are pointing to the volume, and the short interest estimates and saying it's impossible that they've closed.   If it's that easy to fact check something like this, how stupid would Melvin have to assume the media and the retail traders are?  Obviously if it's that easy to fact check it, CNBC and other networks would know if they are lying.  So is the implication that these networks are blatantly lying on the hedge funds behalf?  Wouldn't somebody at the network say, ummm these retail traders can look at the volume and see it hasn't been closed, we are not lying for you when it's so obviously a lie?  This leads me to my next question, which is related to last weeks surge in price.  The run up in price last week looked like a short squeeze. Remember this stock was trading in the teens a few weeks ago.  That run up coincides with the timeline of when Melvin and CNBC are saying Melvin closed.  Could that run up in price have been the short squeeze caused by Melvin closing?  I'm holding strong, added more shares today, but I wanted to start this thread because it feels like the GME thread is full of propaganda and conspiracies.  I wanted a refuge of critical thinking in this sub I've enjoyed for all these years.  If the accusations being thrown at the media and the hedge funds is true, these are big time concerns for the general public.  If the conspiracies and propaganda on this sub are going to cost people significant savings, that's also an issue.  Usually the truth lies somewhere in between, so I'm hoping this sub can cut through the noise and seek the truth.  I don't want this to come across as me raining on the parade either.  I have no idea what's going on, but I've been buying shares on each dip because I like the stock.

The Importance of Volume
Hi guys,     "Low volume pullbacks are often a sign of weak longs taking profit,   but suggest that the long-term uptrend remains intact."    This Zacks link goes into good detail on interpreting low volume and stock price manipulation:     " Interpreting Price and Volume Action  Price action reflects investor sentiment. If a stock is rising, investors are eager to buy; if it is falling, investors are eager to sell.   But for a move to be valid, the stock price action must be confirmed by volume  . As technicians say, volume goes with the trend.   Volume shows how much conviction investors have in a trend.    When you multiply the number of shares traded by the current stock price, you get the total dollar amount that investors are willing to put at risk.   Low volume means few investors are putting only a little money at risk. You cannot trust such price moves, as they are fickle and can easily reverse."       ## Understanding Manipulation    It is easier to manipulate a stock when its volume is low  .   All a manipulator needs to do is execute a few carefully timed trades to create the illusion that a stock is moving so he can get others to buy or sell  .   The goal is   to raise the price if he wants to sell and t  o lower the price if he wants to buy  . If you are suckered in by such a move, your position can quickly turn into a loss as the stock you just bought suddenly reverses course on increased volume.    ü§≤üèΩ   ü§≤üèΩ    ü§≤üèΩ   ü§≤üèΩ   ü§≤üèΩ   Long for 7 shares GME @ 224!!!!

This is a long read but bare with me, this is some important shit and it will make your diamond hands even diamondier.  > Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.  > In a ‚Äò‚Äònaked‚Äô‚Äô short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.  >   Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.

Regardless, the sentiment stands.   shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.  # What's to be done?  Rule 204.  > Rule 204 ‚Äî Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‚Äúthreshold securities‚Äù if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.  You can read more about this here:   lots of information that I haven't covered.  Gamestop  is  or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.  Edit: According to   website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.  #SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.  Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.  #TL:DR  The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

Reminder: The Volkswagon chart pulled back HARD for 6 straight days before liftoff in 2008
Set the date to bracket October through December of 2008. Notice that after peaking at 428, the stock slowly and painfully dragged down under low volume to 201 before launching to the moon the next day. It also stayed on the moon for several days before returning to earth. These investors didn't lose by forgetting to check the stock price for 5 minutes or going to the bathroom at the wrong time. They only lost if they didn't have    .     Please correct me if I'm missing something important. Anybody who is looking to the Volkswagon squeeze as a historical precedent for GME aught to know that it was a process with many ups and downs.      I like GME. I've got 13 shares, and in the morning I plan to convert 120 AMC to GME.            This is not financial advice. I'm learning more and more that I am an idiot who should not be trusted with money.

Attention Mods
Don‚Äôt know how you can do DD on us. Wish you luck. But since my short time here I can see there has been a change in the group think. With a ‚ÄúSnap of your fingers‚Äù you could wipe half of us out and that might be a good way to get this group back to where it was.  Maybe silence the 50% and allow them to follow but not post. If they don‚Äôt like they can whine to the gods.  Yea I post some smack talk but I can prove my GME history and my current holdings.  May you find the way to weed out the cancer that has come to this group.  Current holding 30@317.
If you're on schwab the max sell limit on GME shares is 3790, set it! Don't let anyone short your shares!
Holding is not enough
Congrats, you apes have turned Wall Street upside down. In order to keep your gains and or increase your profits and hurt the hedge funds more you need to do more than just hold.   All you retards held however the stock still fell. Why?  Manipulation? Maybe. But how do you beat the hedge and make the stonk go higher?   You need to buy   Let me explain  Imagine there‚Äôs a pie with four slices three slices are called for this increasing the price of the fourth slice.  Overtime that slice gets traded higher and higher until there‚Äôs not many buyers resulting in low liquidity.   Then one retard tries to trade that fourth slice of pie and can‚Äôt find a customer and sells at a loss and multiply that thousands and millions of times and the price keeps falling.  Along with that factor in RH and other platforms limiting buying and the buying and selling becomes imbalanced and basic economic supply and demand kick in. High supply low demand or low liquidity = lower prices.   Finally add in bunch of retards switching trading platforms. Their money is going to be locked up for few days and if they‚Äôre transferring their shares or options it‚Äôll be about a weeks time frame. Meaning they won‚Äôt be able to do anything in that time further hurting the share price.   So how do we counter all these factors?   All you apes need to keep buying at market price. The more people buy at asking price the higher the stock goes. Don‚Äôt buy NOK, AMC, BB or anything else. Stick to GME. If you‚Äôre not willing to do that then this is over.   I‚Äôm not a financial advisor just another retarded ape.  Don‚Äôt take this as a financial advise.   GME

Wtf happened to the Shit Post flair
Did this miserable band of autistic peasants get lost on the way or is this sub dead ?  Could we get a little more creative than these limited short squeeze plays? This sub is about subpar DD and above average autism. Wtf is going on here. We're even making a run at silver and claiming it like our wife's boyfriends child? I'm ashamed    Let's be serious, we can do a lot better. We've done better, but we've lost our way on this rise to fame. Let's not forget what got us here. It wasn't some washed up hedge fund that we took advantage of that brought us here. It was our collective and diversified degeneracy that allowed us to scale this mountain of a market.   Get your shit together and post high quality garbage instead of these fundamentally sound gme plays. High short ratio and low float makes too much sense and is way too hull proof for what this sub was about. That's all I got to say.

Comfort me! I can feel the bitch in me wanting to become paper hands.
THANK YOU ROBINHOOD!
I just wanted to take a second and applaud robinhood for their excellent customer service and vigilance for the retail investor. This morning I got a notification from Robinhood saying that my limit offer of 10k had been canceled.   Thank god, I had totally forgotten about setting that - 10K WAS WAY TOO LOW!!   I'm so thankful that robinhood was looking out for the little guy this once, preventing me from deeply undervaluing my shares. Some kind of bug was keeping me from setting another limit order but maybe it just doesn't work with numbers that high.  Remember guys: THEY NEED EVERY SINGLE SHARE.

Sorry little Timmy your dogs not getting surgery now
Robinhood‚Äôs regulations led to me taking on MORE risk
Sup tards,   Today I had 83 shares, 2 debit spreads and about 5k cash. Because RH is corrupt I couldn‚Äôt buy any more shares. I planned on transferring to Fidelity but my funds wouldn‚Äôt settle until Thursday (so depending on the withdrawal time I might not have my funds in fidelity until next week) and I wanted to get in on the dip. I would‚Äôve just bought more shares but again, corrupt. Fuck RH. I hope Vlad goes to prison.   Anyways I tried to buy another debit spread - buy the 2/5 240 call, sell the 300 call. Limited upside but also limited downside. Well those whores wouldn‚Äôt let me bc technically my other spreads count as 4 contracts.... the fuk? and you‚Äôre only allowed to have 5   FUK?   so I ended up buying the 2/5 265 call. Obviously I‚Äôm getting porked on it right now and it dawned on me that those fuckers are supposedly limiting my buying IN MY BEST INTEREST when in reality it would‚Äôve been in my best interest to let me do what I fucking want with my own money and buy the other leg of my spread. I‚Äôd be down a helluva lot less if RH let me trade freely.   So in my mind that makes it one of 2 things. They‚Äôre either           a) completely in bed with MMs and Hedge Funds. When they say ‚Äúbeing there for our customers‚Äù they‚Äôre talking about Citadel.           b) complete pussies. Clearinghouses put pressure on them by raising deposit requirements and RH says ‚Äúyes daddy.‚Äù They put up no fight. They don‚Äôt stick their neck out for customers at all. They roll over and lie about their bitchness  Take your pick, either way I‚Äôm gtfo as soon as the squeeze is squoze. GME to the moon        diamond fuckin hands, let‚Äôs make RH go broke
Down $10MM and still holding   . Bought 750 more shares today.
or death
Woken by a sudden explosion from what seemed like only a few meters away, Private Boomer violently jumped to his feet and reached for his weapon between the dirty pile of clothes he made into a makeshift bed. ‚ÄúThose cocksuckers, will never let me rest‚Äù, he then uttered almost by memory ‚ÄúI must continue to hold my ground‚Äù. These words now burned into his mind, as he recalls they were once echoed by Private Boomer‚Äôs commander Major Cohen, whom he has not heard from in many weeks. Not hearing from Major Cohen depressed Private Boomer as another night passed. It seemed the bombings were much greater in the night, after the markets have closed and everyone went home, blood can be seen on the streets. Private Boom is again startled this time by a familiar voice screaming in agony. Outside the window one of Private Boomer‚Äôs mate now lies half dead on the street.  Private Boomer is unable to make out the face of the soldier who now glances up at the window where Private Boomer is looking, making direct eye contact.    The solider now laboring to breath, yells ‚Äúdo not look away, all of you!‚Äù, ‚Äúit was the vendor at the market place.‚Äù Sobbing the solider continued, ‚ÄúI swear to you, first the vendor lined us up and refused to sell us any water, or food‚Ä¶ Robin the vender at the market place is a spy, please believe me!‚Äù. His voice now fading as a panic crowd now gathered around the body. Another soldier can be heard saying ‚ÄúRobin would not do that, surely this solider is mad, tomorrow let us all surrender our gems to the Vin-Elm army first thing in the morning‚Äù. In a triumphant last gasp the dying solider yells ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù, the crowd immediately hushed, ‚ÄúVin-Elm would have to take this from my cold dead hands‚Äù. The soldier‚Äôs body then jerks as he passed away clutching his gems, the only wealth he had left on this earth.  A loud knock on the door brings Private Boomer back into the dark dirty room. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in there‚Äù said the voice. Fearing the worst Private Boomer looks back out the window into the streets, now empty, expect for the body of the brave dead soldier.  It was as if it were yesterday, a boy sitting at the kitchen table, eating tendies, without a worry in the world, these images flashed through Private Boomer‚Äôs mind. Private Boomer now remembered his wife, the days she would sneak him into the bedroom, in what seemed to be forever waiting for HIM to leave‚Ä¶ fuck him, fuck Vin-Elm, fuck this war, I didn‚Äôt want this fight‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúPrivate Boomer‚Äù said a voice which sounded like his wife‚Äôs boyfriend. ‚ÄúPRIVATE BOOMER‚Äù!   The bewildered solider handed Private Boomer a letter, and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs from Major Cohen, it‚Äôs to be kept confidential you autistic bitch‚Äù. ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù said Private Boomer. ‚ÄúThank you sir‚Äù, said the solider as he left the room. Private Boomer did not know if he should read the letter, after all Robin is probably speaking to the Vin-Elm army at this very moment, preparing another bombing that will wipe out the rest of his platoon.    Private Boomer slowly opens the letter. ‚ÄúHello Private Boomer, as you know the war efforts aren‚Äôt going as planned. My intelligence has uncovered a plot by Vin-Elm to destroy our army by destroying our supply chain. In your midst there are many spies, one in particular is named Robin. I pray your supply chain is not broken yet. However, if your supply chain has been compromised we do have a trusted source to the south, his name is Fidel (no not the communist dictator you autistic bitch). Fidel will help you restock in munitions, food and water.   After that you must find a way to destroy Vin-Elm‚Äôs unlimited supply of money. Our unit has tried to invest is more GME aircraft, but were told by the banks they would limit our ability to acquire GME aircraft to protect ourselves from unnecessary risk. However, the bank continues to lend to Vin-Elm‚Äôs army at close to zero % interest despite their highly risky behaviors. Please plan accordingly, it will take a few days to reach Fidel from your vantage point. I will update you with good news shortly, please wait for that message. And one more thing, hold! ‚Äú

After Hours Hurt, But I‚Äôm Still HOLDING
I still like the movies
What I‚Äôm going to do with my GME shares
Right now seems like the time that gme might blow up or it could just hang around where it is or lower.   What I do know is that the HF‚Äôs are shitting it and some autists on here have done really good math. Also, the first ones free and this is my first one.   Everything points to bigger gains which means I‚Äôm going to leave my shares alone like I did when gme shit the bed at 12 and look at them once you fuckers bankrupt another hedge fund and maybe also broker  Edit. Leaving my shares alone means I will HOLD. I know the name of the game. See you boys on the moon

A Message to WSB
First off, I want to say how proud I am of you retards. I've been watching people lose their entire life savings and still hold the line. I joined WSB in December (have been lurking for months prior with my buddies) and fuck has the time flown. I can't believe how much time (and money) I've invested into this subreddit.¬†    One point I just wanted to mention is:   IF the brokers and MMs somehow manage to get away with very illegal market manipulation, in the open and in front of the entire internet, I personally won't be throwing the majority of my paychecks into the stock market anymore. Before the comments section obliterates both my self-respect and karma, I just have to mention that I definitely can't be alone in this. We've had 6 million+ users join us in the past month alone. Also, over 50% of Robinhood users own GME. This isn't just some ordinary situation where WSB loses money, this is a war between the corrupt 1% on Wall Street and the entire rest of the world. I've seen thousands of posts from people joining the cause from countries I can't even pronounce.   Us coming out on the losing end of this one would just solidify to millennials and zoomers everywhere that gambling our money in the stock market wouldn't benefit us. Why would anyone be willing to play a game that is rigged against them?¬†  That being said, I truly do naively believe that the SEC or Congress will have to step in and chalk up a win for the fellas on WSB soon. If they don't, that's potentially millions of people and tens if not hundreds of billions that our future generation won't be willing to invest in our economy, just because the market could be manipulated against us without any serious repercussions.  But until that point, you'll have to pry my 100 shares of GME at $  from my lifeless body if you think I'm going to abandon ship now. It's a cheap price to pay for some long overdue justice, not only for ourselves but for everyone in 08'. Furthermore, you'd be very wrong if you think I'm ever leaving this community full of wonderful, regular people trying to do something better with their lives. Loss porn is the only thing that gets me hard anymore and we all know there will always be plenty of that to go around here.  Hold the line,   . I'll either be with you all on the moon or in the unemployment line. Good luck and godspeed retards.
Theory: Paper hands might actually benefit diamond hands
We're talking GME here.   As we know, the short squeeze (SS) is not a matter of IF. It's a matter of WHEN. The HFs know this, WSB users that know half a thing about the stock market know this. Now, the goal of the HF isn't to cancel the SS, it's to make it as less expensive as possible for them. In other words,     Now comes my theory: paper hands, aka people acting on emotion because of FUD and panic rather than what the numbers say (volume, technical analysic, etc.) are benefitting both us and HF. By selling at a loss or a meager price (anything less than 1k$ is free money, remember), they're allowing HF to cover their shorts for cheaper.   Let's say the HF have a price target on GME of 1000$. In other words, their Harvard quants calculated that at a certain point, they could cover all their shorts and make the SS happen until GME hits 1000 (what I call the D-Day). After that point, they will no longer need to buy anymore shares, ending their torture. They would have covered most of their shorts without going bankrupt. That means that their goal will be to tire us, spread FUD, throw ladder attacks until they can quickly cover their shorts from whatever the price will be to 1000$ (supposing 1000$ is the price they calculated is the more beneficial)  The HF goal is to not go bankrupt. Therefore, paper hands selling their shares could make the SS happen faster by giving more shares to HF (while giving us more shares for cheap, naturally) until the D-Day.   It's a   win-win scenario for diamond hands  . Whether paper hands sell or not,   the SS WILL happen  .   disclaimer: I know nothing about the stock market, I'm just theorizing. What do everyone thinks of this?  TLDR: Paper hands selling might make the SS happen faster for holders (as long as there isn't too many of them).

Today wasn‚Äôt a bloodbath for $GME or $AMC. WE watched LITERAL insanity as Hedgies sat and traded their trash BACK and forth to each other in order to cause YOU to panic. HOLD. BUY.
DD I saw posted elsewhere: hedge funds are trying their hardest to short ladder $AMC and $GME. Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to!   Check out real time trade stats by googling: "Nasdaq AMC real time trades" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond.   These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!  The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you‚Äôd expect a shitload more movement. What they got was   resistance   You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can‚Äôt trade. On BOTH stocks.   The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we.   This is not financial advice. I‚Äôm just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.  Edit:   LOOK AT THIS SHIT LOL      Edit 2:   IF YOU‚ÄôRE WONDERING IF YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING WITH $AMC EL PRES KNOWS AND IS STILL HOLDING.
Owning more than 100% of a company and you: how to generate unlimited gainz
So I've been thinking with all this bullshit about short selling: what if you owned more than 100% of a company?  Thanks to short selling, it's actually possible since short selling effectively creates more shares (even "legitimate" short selling where shares shorted are borrowed).  So how can you cash in if you own more than 100% of a company?  Easy.  Just gift the company some money and immediately pay it out in the form of dividends.  You'll receive more from the dividends then you put in thanks to the extra shares you got from the short sellers (who have to make payments in lieu of dividends), allowing you to do the same process again with even more money.  Of course, to do this you don't even need to own over 100%.  You can work with other shareholders to pull off this trick too, so long as the group together owns more than 100% of the company.  In short, short selling is stupid, gme to the
Almost 75% of all retail $GME orders were to buy (Fidelity). DONT BUY INTO THE FUD
IMPORTANT EDIT:   I know this will read bullish and I am long $GME still so there‚Äôs that. However, please be mindful of seeking evidence for a conclusion  ; making conclusions based on evidence. In other words, we should try to make decisions based on data, not trying to find anything that supports our decision at all cost. This post was intended to provide information  ; data with a little analysis. Please attack it, poke holes in it, crucify it, share it on skeptical subs, and otherwise test it before making a conclusion. This is the way, and how we got as far as we did.  Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC  ; $GME.  And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point)  ; news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.  Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a   and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.  Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME      With that out of the way, I present to you,  # Exhibit A: Order Distribution  \~   75%    of all $GME orders on Fidelity  today, on 2/1  were to  buy  the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.     That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab.   There's more:  WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost    30   % today, but the order book is split    45/55   , not    35/65   . Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.  # Exhibit B: Volume     Today's volume was half of the daily average.  Half of the daily average . And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:  "  'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'"  In other words, flat or even  declining  on low volume often precedes      . Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.  There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.  # Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon  I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:  1. Transition from Robinhood  ; other affected brokers to mainstream solutions   ‚Ä¢ This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.   ‚Ä¢¬†Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.   \- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta. 2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $  billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.  # Conclusions  Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.  GME to moon.    ANOTHER EDIT:   Welcome to the end of the post. I‚Äôm proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I‚Äôll answer them as soon as they show up.    UPDATE:   Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here‚Äôs the best I could do:  1‚ÄìRetail made no dent so what to expect now? - I don‚Äôt know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.  2‚ÄìShould I buy now or what? - I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don‚Äôt want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.  3‚ÄìSmart money is leaving and you‚Äôll be left holding the bag - I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they‚Äôre leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don‚Äôt use comments, you‚Äôll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I‚Äôm wrong  4‚ÄìAMC? - I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.  5‚ÄìWhen selling then? - I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don‚Äôt have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I‚Äôll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don‚Äôt invest more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don‚Äôt have to sell if you can lose everything. I‚Äôm probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.
Poll: If you executed JAN 29 ITM GME calls have you received your calls? And if so, who do you trade with?
I am doing an open source poll here. I myself am still waiting for my execution of $95 JAN 29 call option to be fulfilled by Ally Invest. While I am waiting, Ally has locked my account and prevented me from doing any trading stating that management at Ally made the decision "to protect the firm".  Even crazier, while on the phone with them this evening, they delivered the shares to my account. I logged back in tonight,   AND THE SHARES ARE GONE!    I am beginning to really buy into u/johnnydaggers theory here:    I think that clearing houses are having a hard time assigning shares because they don't know where the shares are.  \#DeliverTheShares     Edit 1: Just got off the phone. Ally said that he saw the shares were there but they were removed because Ally was doing an update. He said he could see them on the "back side of the house", what ever the hell that means.  You all wanted photos, so here is the best I can do. I didn't take a photo when the shares were in my account, but I can still take a photo of when I tried to set a limit sell order to test whether or not I could trade. That you can see. (Don't worry I'm not out at $1,000 it was just a test limit.) in the photos you'll see I bought 10 shares and I had a call option. Notice how my GME holdings are also messed up, showing me down $13K on 10 shares?!?     Edit 2: To be clear, I called Ally Thursday JAN 28 to tell them I wanted to exercise my option. They marked it down. They knew I wanted the shares.
Thanks for the DISCOUNT! Added a few more after liquidating portfolio of last little pieces.     üåï
Ouch.
This is all of my money... tough day to stomach but I believe in the movement...
Alexa, show me a side that's on their last fucking breath
We need to stop letting them "control the narrative"
These assholes exceeded their personal risk tolerance.  Now I see everyone blaming robinhood for liquidity shit, but why did so many others follow suit? Almost all the brokers tried to restrict trading, but now it's being framed as just Robinhood.  Furthermore, why weren't there liquidity issues during the run-up in Tesla last year? That stock went up way harder just before it split and then continued it's run up.. no liquidity issues. I am sure other stocks have had similar runs, no liquidity issues.  Why all of a sudden now with gamestop?   I swear these guys are going to get away with this shit if people don't start making a fuss over this. The news is really spinning this a completely different direction from where it should be, and the average american is clueless as to how are market really works.   Edit:
Don't forget why you are here in WSB...
##    make money.    As one of the OG 2 mil wsb members who was here before the recent influx of new users, I've seen my fair share of gain and loss p0rn over the past couple of years, and I've been on both sides of the trade. Usually my gains or losses have been in the 5 figure range. Whenever I did lose, I have been able to grind my way out and earn it back over the following months. It was still a distant dream to think I'd finally catch a hidden diamond early and ride it to the moon (I missed out on TSLA). I simply did not have the cohones to take the yolo risks like some of you. Then came GME last Nov/Dec with rational fundamental story that had all the traits of a high conviction play that fits my trading style, and you all know the rest of the GME story that comes after that.  ##Have an end game. Don't trade emotionally.   Lately, I see a lot of people have gotten a bit personal and even political when it comes to GME on this sub.   I'm not here to tell you what your trade should be. Buy, hold, sell, sit on the sidelines and spam memes for easy internet points. Do whatever you want that makes you happy. What I am advocating for is have an exit plan that allows you to walk away without regret.     If this means buying shares and holding forever even if it goes to zero, great. If it means taking some profit and holding a core position, great. If it means selling everything and using the profit to improve your own quality of life, great. There is no shame in choosing your own path and executing your own trading strategy.  I say this because I have not slept well in the last 3 weeks, even slacking off on my day job by constantly refreshing /new of WSB. Part of it is excitement, part is FOMO on potential profits. What little sleep I did get were also dreams about GME and imagining the different scenarios play out. So yeah, I went with scenario #2 above where I cashed out a chunk of my initial position last week to lock in 560k+ profits in the $300s, and still holding 1k shares that I will take with me to Valhalla.   Proof:    No matter what happens now, I'm walking away a millionaire courtesy of the awesome people on this sub who take the time and effort to share their DD and strategies with us.  tips hat   ##What's next for GME?  There's plenty of other DD posts in the sub that will give a better analysis and theories of what might happen this week. Most immediately is that institutions have until tomorrow to deliver shares for calls that expired ITM last Friday. So hopefully there will be some upwards movement, but we have a long way to go to breakout above $400. Even still, this will likely be another gamma squeeze and not a short squeeze as HFs are willing grind their losses back rather than cover and concede a win to retail investors.   This will probably go on for weeks, but the clock is ticking for HFs. The closer we get to the earnings on March 25, the more desperate they will get. I do believe GME management will report insane revenue numbers and profit, and then detail reorg plans for the rest of the year.   This will only encourage anyone still sitting on the sidelines that GME turnaround is legitimate and we have another TSLA-like stock rise to new levels. This will force sell-side institutions to reevaluate and upgrade the stock as well, providing another tailwind for GME.    Disclaimer:  This is not professional trading advice.

HOW TO GET YOUR $GME BILLBOARD APPROVED
Hey there r/wallstreetbets!  Here's a guide on how to get your Blip Billboard approved. It appears as though some throughout the country are getting denied, like me. I reached out to the company and finally got approved, so I wanted to share that knowledge like u/DeepFuckingValue shared the knowledge of $GME many months ago.  I  tried to use the built-in tool to get an approved design but was rejected (like people with paper hands were by their parents) each time. UNTIL I UPLOADED A DESIGN!  That's the trick. If you use their generator, they reject the emojis. But when you use an image, you're in better shape than GameStop is to be the BEST STOCK EVER. Gosh darnit, I just LOVE this stock.    Here's what I used that got approved:     Please feel free to take it, use it, or modify it, JUST DON'T SELL!! (this is not financial advice)
Stuck on RH but I ain‚Äôt leaving
$OSTK YOLO. This is the way.
10k -> 190k ->   Going to the V O I D or back to 10k trying
Guess what I‚Äôm not doing? I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING LEAVING.
THESE DIAMOND HANDS WILL HOLD AS LONG AS IT TAKES FOR THE SQUEEZE TO SQUOZE. GONNA BUY MORE AT THE DIP TOMORROW MORNING. WE LIKE THE STOCK
Gme: don‚Äôt shit yourself after one red day
Today was a bad day. Personally I just like the stock. For those of you that see this as a war; these things happen, we lost a battle due to ladder attacks, paper hands and a fuck tonne of bias fake news (silver/ gme is dead in wsb/ lies about shorts positions and much more) but remember you autistic soldiers, we will win the war. We know those üçã   haven‚Äôt covered because the volume has been stupid low. Also I‚Äôm proud of all of you   s ik you aren‚Äôt scared bc we survived last weeks 500 to 110 dip. The hedgies are scared and will be squoze eventually. Remember they still lost a fuck tonne today through short interest. Stay strong, cuddle up to your wife‚Äôs boyfriend and keep holding.   Not financial adivce I am retard.  Manditory gme rockets for those of you that can‚Äôt read      Positions: 57 shares avg price 50$
Hold the fucking line and buy more GME go get that fuel!!!!
Is there anyway we can find out how much the hedge funds liquidated on friday?
There was a huge sell off on Friday, the whole market was red, if we can get a number or estimation on how much capital they gathered from selling their shares on Friday and if we can estimate the interest on their short position we can know   how much they are paying a day  .  This way we can know how many days they can keep on paying the interest on their short position until they run out of money and they have to cover.  Therefore we can also estimate when the squeeze will happen.  (Just something that crossed my mind,   back to eating crayons  )   (This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor, this is only for  learning purposes)

Let‚Äôs Set the Record Straight
For the past 3 and a half hours or so I‚Äôve seen post after post after post from you autists flaunting your future GME gains with a flair of ‚ÄúLoss‚Äù.  Let‚Äôs set the record straight.  Unless you are a paper-handed little bitch who jacks off his wife‚Äôs boyfriend and decides to sell GME, THESE ARE NOT LOSSES.  They are the FOUNDATION of the massive castle of TENDIES you will soon receive from Melvin and Shitron after we bend those fuckers over and take what is rightfully ours.  So in conclusion:  1.) If you do desire to show off your GME activity over the last day, mark your post flair as it rightfully should be as ‚ÄúGAIN‚Äù.  2.) CHANGE your mindset.  Why must you think of GME‚Äôs activity today as a loss?  It is an OPPORTUNITY for greatness as those fuckers run out of ammunition and can‚Äôt afford to keep the stock price lower.   3.) BUY MORE GME to cement your status as the next multi-millionaire.  Do you think DFV became the alpha male he is by selling all of his GME like a paper handed bitch?  NO.  He‚Äôs held.  Does he mark his posts as ‚ÄúLoss‚Äù!?  NO.  They are his GAINS.  By an alpha.  By someone else‚Äôs wife‚Äôs boyfriend.  Buy GME.
Where were you when the Shorts cam a calling. I WAS HOLDING!
Anyone else not give a single fuck about Robindead‚Äôs excuses?
Firstly, you weren‚Äôt transparent with us right away. If you had been, maybe just maybe I would let this slide. Idk if you have a shitty PR that is just as retarded as us or what, but that was dumb as hell and insulting to all of your customers.  Secondly, if I go to get my haircut and the clippers break as they are cutting my hair, am I just supposed to walk out of the fucking store with my hair half cut until they can fix their clippers?! No, they are supposed to be prepared to provide the service I am paying for.   As a result of being woefully unprepared to provide the service we pay you (you make money on us) for, you cost your customers probably billions of dollars by stopping the gamma squeeze right as things were really starting to heat up.  I close by saying fuck off. You have lost my business forever and I hope you go bankrupt.   GME        Edit: I‚Äôve been accused of singling out Robindead. The only reason for this is that I was only a company of Robindead and they just sent me an email full of excuses for why they cost me thousands of $.
Im not a paper handed pussy boi, but I am retarded and broke. Diamond hand gang rise up
GME - 5 important thoughts and questions to consider
(1)   Do we know if there is a resource for which we can track hedge fund movements? I know that they are a dark cloud of secrecy but DFV (and others who first had this GME stock idea) were able figure out that Melvin Capital was the one who was short. Where did he (and others find this info)? Since then, the news and everyone else has mentioned Melvin Capital so many times that we are taking for granted how and where this information is tracked? Given how much manipulation hedge funds are taking part in, it would be a huge asset to see as much information as we can about their positions.    (2)   No one should make any decision on GME (or any stock) on emotions. Successful trades are the ones that are made based on on data.  That means we need accurate short data. What is the best resource for short data that is most accurate and most frequently updated?    (3)   According to the below short info websites, I am seeing that there are   million short interest. If this is accurate, then GME will at some point go into a short squeeze. Its just simply the data. If not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the next day. I think the key would be a trigger which would overwhelm the suppression. An example of a trigger would be a positive earnings release or some new positive development in their strategic shift to e-commerce. If we have to wait, so be it. Why? Because we do not pay margin to wait. They pay margin daily for shorting. Remember that.          (4)   For those of you who participated in the Tesla short squeeze, are there any lessons learned that can be applied to GME? There were a ton of shorts on Tesla. But Tesla kept announcing new exciting things and churning out improving delivery/profit numbers. The shorts got squeezed. Did these hedge funds try to short ladder Tesla? I'd imagine that the amount of positive news overwhelmed attempts to suppress Tesla stock price? Maybe that is what will happen with GME? GME is not Tesla but it does have tremendous potential with Ryan Cohen and a potential move to e-commerce. I'm wondering if maybe we will trade flat like this with ups and down until we get some kind of positive news trigger and then it will initiate a larger squeeze and perhaps will happen over a long period of time? Tesla, for example, rose dramatically in 2020 but it was kind of spread out through the year. If so, then we just need to be patient.    (5)   I am seeing a lot of newbies ask very stupid questions. Please stop asking what the next GME is or what trade you should make or how high GME will get to or what price is a good price to buy at or what is an option. If you are asking these kinds of questions, then stock trading might not be for you. Why? Because you are not understanding what we do here at WSB. We don't give anyone instruction on what to do or what not to do. We discuss ideas, we discuss different options. There is an expectation that you come to WSB with basic knowledge. When you decide to do a trade or not do it, it is purely your decision. And then you live with the loss or gain. And please please use Google to learn the basics instead of coming here and asking what an option is.  I know mods are overly pressured right now in all they have to do with the extra members but perhaps we will need to consider banning people who ask these kinds of questions.
Going full damage control mode.
Are you going to Give Up? Or make the HF's realize they Fucked Up?
Why are you buying these shares? To stick it to Wall Street? To earn big? Maybe its a bit of both.  Youve invested, you might be in the red right now, you might want to minimize your losses, you might wonder whats going to happen if it sinks even lower. But you shouldnt ponder if's, you should be thinking about what is actually going to happen. And that my friend, is a big fucking rocket fucking itself through the moon and blowing up mars unleashing a rain of that sweet sweet Wall Street billionaire dollar dollar bill, and those bills now belong to you.   They say its always darkest just before the sun rises. Fuck the sun. Where we are going we wont see no fucking sun, Were going so far away from this fucking planet that the only thing hotter than you is Gliese 581.    "But the price is dropping!!! HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY WHEN IT GOES NEGATIVE??????"    Stocks are priced after   supply   and   demand.     If   supply   is   high   then price is   low   If   demand   is   high   then price is   high    But what if the   demand   was   high  , the supply was   low   and you, as someone whos   shorted   this stock, needed the   supply   to be   high   so price becomes   low    Well... What you could do is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting of stocks.  So you hatch a plan. You and your hedgefund friends are going to use your own stocks that you own and trade them very very quickly with eachother at low low prices. The supply is still low, you guys are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system cant recognize that its the   same   stocks being traded. Its just seeing the   amount of times   the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore thinks the supply is   high  .  Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesnt matter though, since you as someone who is   holding   isnt selling at that price. It doesnt MATTER what the price is if noone is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its many different stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still   low  .  Why is this important? Its important because the hedgefunds need to   BUY   your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy   YOUR   stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. And if they cant buy they cant close their shorts. If they cant close their shorts they'll have to pay interest. And when the interest becomes too much they are going to be   FORCED   to buy   YOUR   stocks at whatever price   YOU   offer. This is the   squeeze    The squeeze starts when the hedgefunds cant afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. Theyll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If noone sells untill 1000usd they are going to be forced to pay that, if noone sells until 10000usd theyll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions en masse they will   FLOOD   the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isnt the actual price. Its a price thats tricked into the system.   This is why you   HOLD   no matter how much the price goes down. if   everyone   holds there is no   supply   and if there is no   supply   it doesnt matter how low the price is   SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NOONE FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO BUY FROM   so they cant close their positions, theyll have to keep paying interest, and at some point they will   HAVE   to   BUY YOUR STOCKS   no matter the   PRICE  .     Buy orders   (demand)   are more than sell orders   (supply)   and yet the stock lost value.   This is why people are talking about   volume  . The   total amount   of stocks   (actual supply)   being traded is   low (price should increase)  , but   the total amount of times (percieved supply)   those same stocks are being traded is   high (price decreases)  .  You need to understand, it doesnt matter how low the price drops right now, the squeeze hasnt happened. the squeeze happens when the hedgefunds are   forced   to buy back. That is the squeeze, and it is what will skyrocket the stocks. Right now the hedgefunds are trying to prevent the squeeze.  So what are you going to do, give up? or capitalize on their fuck up? Every dollar the hedgefunds lose goes to us, but only so long as we own stocks.   So   HOLD  , the price might drop but the rocket launches when the HF's are forced to buy back.  Im not a financial advisor and i ate a crayon for dinner

WaPo shilling: wallstreetbets are the bad guys
The good guys in the gamestop story ? It's the hedge funds and short sellers       >.....   >   >So far, this time is different. The GameStop speculators are not merely in a frenzy about one stock. Their goal is to destroy the traders who link stock prices to fair value.    To suggest a political analogy, they are not just blindly devoted to their candidate; they deny the legitimacy of the opposition party   . They are not just acting within the system; they want to overthrow the system. It‚Äôs as though ‚Äî just imagine ‚Äî a rabble gripped by conspiracy theories were to attack the rules of democracy itself. The name ‚ÄúGameStop‚Äù is apt.   >   >.....   >   >Generally speaking, a hedge fund is a small-to-medium-size company that makes money by choosing smart investments. There is nothing nefarious about this. To the contrary, if you don‚Äôt like too-big-to-fail banks that get backstopped by taxpayers, small-enough-to-fail hedge funds ought to be celebrated. If you worry about complex financial conglomerates with corrupting conflicts of interest, single-purpose investment boutiques are simpler and healthier.   >   >.....   >   >What about short sellers? These are specialists who research stocks that might go down, sometimes because bosses are illegally covering up bad news about their companies. When short sellers identify a case of fraud or similar, they borrow and sell the stock, hoping to buy it back at a lower price later. Again, there is nothing evil about this. To the contrary, it‚Äôs a way of keeping prices honest. A market without short sellers is like a political system without investigative journalists. This, however, is not how GameStoppers see things. They have gone after a short seller named Andrew Left, hacking into his social media accounts, sharing his personal information online, ordering dozens of pizzas to be delivered to his home in the middle of the night, and texting his children with threatening and profane language, according to the Wall Street Journal
15   ¬ß 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks
"Dear SEC and President Biden,  I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15   ¬ß 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.  Section 78i(a) clearly states that "It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- (2) To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, any security not so registered, or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others."  Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called "short ladder attacks" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15   ¬ß 78i. "Short ladder attacks" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here         check this out  Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the   Government.  Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that "Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction."  I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.  Sincerely,  Your Average Retail Investor"  This post was crafted by /u/SenateMajorityLeader. We have the world's eyes on this subreddit, and if we flood the forum with this information, it can't just be dismissed. Keep reposting.
You can contact the SEC to file complaints online or via phone. Every aggrieved investor should be contacting them to demand they do their job now, along with your Senators and House Reps.
They're cheating in the open for all to see.  They fear no repercussions and think they can outlast us. They can't. We hold. They bleed. We love it.   But their crimes must still be punished.  We millions of multi-partisan investors from all corners of non-elite society should be raising as much hell as possible with all the governmental entities that are supposed (but only pretend) to protect us.  (The SEC page also provides the contact information for various departments that are not relevant. Please let's not be asses and waste the time of people who can't do   would just be harassment and would hurt our own cause of seeking proper enforcement of the law)  Let your congressional reps know you won't forget at primary or general election time whether they did something to protect their constituents or whether they impotently watched Wall Street blatantly manipulate prices to steal from millions of hard-working Americans.
Stop me if I am wrong, but are we ‚Äúgreater fools‚Äù to be investing in GME? If ‚Äúretard‚Äù really means ‚Äúgreater fool‚Äù I‚Äôm proud to be a retard with all of you.
The greater fool is an economic term the means essentially ‚Äú[people will] buy something not because they believe that it is worth the price, but rather because they believe that they will be able to sell it to someone else at an even higher price.‚Äù  I believe that most people spend their lives and their savings to be conservative with their investments and not try to be the greater fool. They want to sit comfortably and ensure their retirement with the purpose of safety. But we are investing in something with a purpose to screw over those guys in their high towers laughing at us for being greater fools. Because of it a few platforms put trade restrictions because they were scared and cowardly from their losses. They felt how we did during the 2008 financial crisis.  I am reluctant to post this because I am an amateur investor, practicing nothing but conservative long-term trades, but today I took a chance‚Äîa really risky chance that may not pay out for me (well us) in the end‚ÄîI bought a bit of GME what some may think is not that much, but for me, it‚Äôs a down payment on a house, it‚Äôs a new car, it‚Äôs remodel on a house... I do believe what we are doing will definitely be in case studies in business schools, possibly history books, but I believe what we are doing is great. We‚Äôre doing what those hedge fund guys didn‚Äôt think we had the balls or the means to do.  It temporarily paid off for us in the short, I‚Äôm hoping it will pay off for us in the long term.  The Newsroom was right when Sloan Sabbath said ‚Äúthis country was built of greater fools‚Äù. I‚Äôm really proud to be a part of something with you all. Diamond hands retards and greater fools!!
Just bought 250 more shares of AMC, I see all you monkeys staying strong don‚Äôt let anyone tell you different we are winning this.

THEY'RE USING ETFS TO FUEL THE SHORT LADDERS - Low Effort DD on $GME and Why No Squeeze
Hey dipshits -- take a look at  . Notice anything weird about their charts? The HFs are purchasing ETFs that have exposure to GME and are "redeeming" the shares inside of them to get access to the rights to a GME stock. They're using the redemption rights from the ETFs to then sell the stock without directly influencing the price of GME.   Here's some proof from the top four ETFs with exposure to GME:              This is likely the reason we're not seeing the other side of their short ladder attacks. They're buying exposure from the ETFs and dumping the redemption rights to flood the market.   This is not investment advice. I'm long $GME.  Edit:
It‚Äôs not the size of your holdings! It‚Äôs what you do with it!   why! HOLD

FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD
This is the most blatent and public manipulation I have ever witnessed.  GameStops primary base of customers is also the primary base of users on Robinhood. GameStops primary base of investors is also the primary base of users on Robinhood. Robinhood is preventing the largest customer and investor base from purchasing any new shares, and limit 1 if you dont already have any.  FUCK YOU ROBINHOOD  If your clearing house is preventing you from allowing trading, FIND A NEW FUCKING CLEARING HOUSE AND WE WILL SUPPORT YOU. If you dont have enough cash to allow trading ASK US FOR SOME CASH AND WE WILL SUPPORT YOU. Everybody likes to belittle the 'Robinhood investor' but don't forget that is the same investor base that forced almost every brokerage on the planet to drop your comissions.   These motherfuckers move markets.  We are not the cause of a short squeeze, the short squeeze was caused by a shift in the future outlook of this company.  GameStop is a well established brand, with a well established customer base, that has brought in well established talent to shift to a digital e-commerce marketplace for gamers.    We see the future, while you guys continue to say companies like Tesla 'have no fundamental justification'  Get fucked. Elon deserves to be the richest person on the planet because he will move fucking mountains to make his companies successful and make this world a better place, while you guys fight to eliminate taxes on pollution. I realize we are not your customers Robinhood, but you should take notice here of the fact that not a single person here forgot what these hedge funds did to us in 2008. Nobody forgot what they tried to do to Tesla. Don't think for one second that anybody here will forget what you did to us in 2021.  Open the fucking markets. We are not fucking leaving.  I posted a movie on this on my profile, but I can't seem to find a mod to help me get it posted here. If you are a gay mod pls help.    Shares, and reloaded on calls on the dip today
Trading and Price Asymmetries on $GME
Good evening fellow Autists,  A great many of you who are participating in this sub are new to the community and many of you are new to trading/ finance altogether. I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.  Many of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation  , external disinformation  , market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading.   I pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:    Shares Traded: 475,690      Average Volume: 106,230,000      Volume Percentage:      The closing price at 4 PM was $  and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $  meaning a share price decline of $   During AH trading, GME share price fell       on trading volume       of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.  I rewatched "The Big Short" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn't work out it's because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing.
$PMVP UPDATE (before I sell em all and buy all the $AMC I can get my hands on)
I DIDNT HEAR NO BELL    ü•ä
Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.
First of all, the point of this post is not to tell you how high I think GME will go. This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.  All of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. We‚Äôve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.  Yes, it‚Äôs a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.  So lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of   12%   and Porsche buying up   43%   of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GME‚Äôs case would put it at $30,000 per share.  As we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us  ü§≤  are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.  I dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.  So lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.  The hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke. The hedge funds will have no way to cover, and someone is going to have to bail them out.   Our economy is about to collapse.    The hedge funds know this. Why do you think they are so long on Silver and Gold? Precious metals perform well during recessions.   Andddd because this is WSB, here are my positions: - GME shares - SPY 374p 2/5 - SPY 300p 3/1 - SPY 250p 3/1 - UVXY 14c 3/1 - not a single SLV call or share because fuck the hedge funds  TLDR:     ü§≤    Edit: To those of you saying I‚Äôm making up numbers:      GME as most valuable company in the world: $  = $32,375  I used $100k as a lower bounds for the price because we can assume a 10x higher short percent would create more than a 10x higher price, so multiplying by 3 is a safe lower bound.
She is climbing!!

GME/AMC Failure to Delivers VS Price (Attn: SEC Interns)
So some of you have noticed that the SEC publishes data for failure to deliver numbers for each symbol every day.    After reading this post by u/johnnydaggers   , I got curious if this theory had legs.  I downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.  It yields some interesting results:  EDIT: Blue lines are # total collective failures on that date, green line is closing price   GME:     AMC:    For both these stocks the failure to delivers are off the charts in recent history, and those increases in failures seem to correlate with suppressed pricing.  Now there may be legit reasons for a failure to happen, and without knowing which firms caused these failures we can't truly draw any conclusions other than  something is fucky .   We can pretty easily generate a corresponding chart for any symbol with this:  GM:    Now IF these failures are coming from a handful of firms (SEC / DTCC should have that data..), I would say it is quite evident of intentional naked selling to manipulate the markets.  But ~~I'm not an expert~~ _I am a smoothbrained retard ape_ and would love to hear from anyone who understands this better than I do.  Source:        I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice...  Positions: 17 GME, 350 AMC, 50 SLV,  3 2/5 UVXY $20c, 10 UVXY, 2000 LODE, 5 LODE 4/16 $2c    EDIT2:       Checked some other symbols and some seem to have correlation and some are uncorrelated w/ alot of FTD, but here's an interesting pair:         Others:       - seems to have many instances of FTD     - insane amount of FTD uncorrelated with price  If anyone knows where I can download short interest data PM me and I'll see if I can merge it into the dataset

Fubo stock on track to hit $200
Over the past few weeks, fuboTV has been caught up in the huge short-squeeze rattling through the markets because, well, the stock is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market.  In the first half of December, fuboTV‚Äôs stock more than doubled over two weeks on the back of super-strong subscriber numbers. The strength in fuboTV‚Äôs subscriber base broadly foreshadows its huge role in the live TV streaming world.  On the heels of that huge rally, multiple short-sellers targeted FUBO. The favored argument amongst bears is that demand for live TV is dying, the streaming platform itself is commoditized and the business model is built on broken economics. Fubo‚Äôs short interest currently sits at about 65% of the float.  Then, the Reddit-inspired short-squeeze broke out. It wasn‚Äôt just GME stock that went flying. All heavily shorted stocks flew alongside GME stock. FUBO stock, with 65% of its float sold short, was a beneficiary of the rising tide in heavily shorted names.  But, this week, many of these short squeeze stocks have plunged.  Not FUBO stock ‚Äî and that‚Äôs because fuboTV is no GameStop or AMC.  ## Unlike GameStop, fuboTV Is Fundamentally Strong  FuboTV ‚Äî unlike many of the other heavily shorted companies that soared last week ‚Äî is supported by very strong fundamentals and has a long runway for profitable growth ahead.  Here‚Äôs the story.  Media consumption is pivoting from linear TV to streaming TV because the latter is cheaper, more flexible, and more convenient. Yet, even though   Netflix   has reached ubiquity among   households, most households still pay for cable TV, because Netflix doesn‚Äôt have live sports, live programming or news ‚Äî three things which Americans still love to watch.  That‚Äôs why a new generation of live TV streaming services has emerged over the past decade. These services take live TV content, and package it into a streaming service ‚Äî somewhat like a ‚ÄúNetflix for TV‚Äù. Because demand for live TV is robust and because streaming TV offers significant advantages over linear TV, these live TV streaming services represent the future of TV and will one day be as commonplace in households as cable TV is today.  fuboTV is one of these live TV streaming services. It‚Äôs differentiation is that it is a sports-focused live TV streaming platform. That is, the company is hyper-focused on acquiring exclusive sports content and launching a digital sportsbook to enable dynamic sports betting through its live TV streaming platform.  In other words, fuboTV projects as a live TV streaming service purpose-built for sports super-fans and gamblers.  That‚Äôs a large audience. About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.  Thus, fuboTV projects as a streaming platform that will one day have tens of millions of paid subscribers. It has just 500,000 paid subs today.  The runway for growth here is very long ‚Äî and consequently, the potential upside in FUBO stock is very big.  ## FuboTV Stock to $200?  My numbers indicate that FUBO stock will soar to $200 over the next several years.  Here are those numbers.  I broadly assume that fuboTV can scale to \~10 million paid subscribers by 2030. I think that average revenue per subscriber per month can grow to about $70, assisted by ad revenue growth and sports betting revenue growth. That implies around $  billion in 2030 revenues for fuboTV.  I see EBITDA margins running towards 20%, as ad revenue and sports betting revenue add higher-margin revenue firepower into the business model and boost margins.  Assuming so, my modeling suggests fuboTV is on track to do about $10 in earnings per share by 2030.  Based on a 20X multiple, that implies a long-term price target for FUBO stock of $200.  ## Bottom Line on FUBO Stock  Not all short squeeze stocks are created equal. On one hand, you have GME stock and AMC stock, who have tons of short squeeze firepower but very weak fundamentals. On the other hand, you have FUBO stock, who has almost as much short-squeeze firepower and strong fundamentals, too.  That‚Äôs a powerful combination which should sustain the current uptrend in FUBO stock not just for the next few days ‚Äî but for the next few years, as well.
Weekend Gains on $SLV. Closed Out 100% Today to Whoever the Fuck is Buying This Shit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Do you all not see the obvious double fake here?
Do you think they don't understand what all the shiny grey pushing that they are doing is going to make WSB think?  They want to turn you against physical. That's why they are pushing paper.   And it's working.  Don't make any moves until the GME war is over, but if you let yourself be turned off this next move then you are falling for their double fake. Getting people behind physical would actually be meaningful. That's why they are pushing Paper so hard, knowing it will turn this hive mind against the shiny grey outright.      Nuke me with downvote. Idc. Its sad to see everyone fall right into the trap though.
If I can hold through today you can too. And don't worry, I bought more during the dip on Fidelity.
We hold
Why was NOK restricted from buying last week? Makes me think Robinhood and such are being honest...
Hear me out. Majority of platforms restricted buying GME, AMC, NOK, etc.   But why NOK? It makes no sense other than unusually high volume that it puts market makers and such unable to scramble for shares. NOK is NOT shorted, so it's not like limiting NOK was helping big wigs. If anything, it hurt them, as a handful of big corps are largely invested in NOK.  Thoughts? What am I missing?  AMC, GME, Bb make complete sense, but NOK doesn't. It makes me think we may be wrong about corruption via clearing houses and such.
I was wrong. Today I sold my position
... in everything, then bought the dip on GME. Currently holding only GME and a little bit of cash.  While I have been telling people to hold BANG (BB, AMC, NOK, GME) stocks, I realize that this has been misinterpreted. GME is the one true stock. Those who cannot afford GME at this point are free to look at other stocks, but GME is the one true stock.
Help a confused retard?
S3 came out today saying shorted shares of GameStop fell by 56%    However, Nasdaq released an article saying that GME is still the most shorted stock out there with a short interest of 121%    Which is correct?  I am    of course cause I like the stock and am looking forward to seeing it

$TLRY DD
Hello Everyone.   I know short squeezes have been a hot topic in the recent weeks by I think I may have stumbled upon another opportunity.     According to FinViz, $TLRY has a 50% short interest currently and a 30M float.       This is very interesting to me since $TLRY has been the beneficiary of a short squeeze in the past and has had relatively   good press in the past few days. Linked below.                   TLDR; Exclusivity to sell medical MJ in  Portugal                TLDR; chosen supplier for medical MJ study                TLDR; Upcoming merger with $APHA to become worlds largest cannabis company.                Senate majority leader setting legalization  of MJ as a priority for this secession of congress.    On the technical side, $TLRY has been improving all its bottom q/q even. See image below.          With growth in revenue and net income, EPS have also increased q/q which is a great sign for investors. With US legalization on the horizon and expansion into EU markets, it hard to believe that $TLRY isn't headed up from here. Which should lead to a squeeze on the 50% short when they are forced to cover.    TLDR; $TLRY has improving technical, balance sheets and is expanding into newer markets. With legalization in US on the horizon, its hard to believe that the 50% shorts wont be squeezed.    Please comment below with your thoughts. Lets ride this to tendie town!

We Pulled GME to over $500 - They Said It Couldn't Be Done
shares. 1969 is also the first time we landed on the moon. Coincidence? Destiny.
I feel like clarification is needed about Today
There‚Äôs a lot of new people on here that don‚Äôt really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions.     Why no spike today?  :  First of all, we can‚Äôt know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts.  All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON‚ÄôT COVER.¬† They use several tactics to delay it, but they can‚Äôt circumvent it. They‚Äôre bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.  It might take just a few days, or weeks... But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price. That‚Äôs why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it‚Äôs not.  We also know they‚Äôre down BAD. Why? Because they‚Äôre attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.  So let‚Äôs see what tactics they are using:    Short ladder attacks  :  What is a short ladder attack?  The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it "looks" like the stock is plummeting. It‚Äôs only effective if we would sell.        Just look at the volume. People are not selling:      Infiltrating WSB and other social media  :  Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There‚Äôs tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:      Manipulating the Media  :   Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)           Now let‚Äôs get some clarification on   SILVER:    There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don‚Äôt seem to realize 3 things:  1.   Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.   GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)¬† 2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.¬† 3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre pushing this narrative in the media.¬†  SLV inverting GME:     The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.    IF   you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that‚Äôs just my retard opinion.     SILVER ISN‚ÄôT ‚ÄúREDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY‚Äú.   You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.  Silver squeeze not happening links:         Well. Let‚Äôs see to what extend they fucked up exactly:¬†    Short Version:   The short version is that a review of the   'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'   data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.  There are are   71 million shares   of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than   102,000,000   shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.  On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).    Once you include call options,   retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)  . This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.  Long version here:      At these levels it‚Äôs NOT about the price, it‚Äôs about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That‚Äôs why they want you to sell so bad.    ü§öüèº ü§öüèº ü§öüèº ü§öüèº ü§öüèº ü§öüèº ü§öüèº ü§öüèº   Last but not least I‚Äôm holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I‚Äôm holding because I hope to see a better future and I‚Äôm holding for all you out there.  To the Moon or zero.       APES. STRONG. TOGETHER.      Disclaimer:  This is not financial advice, I‚Äôm literally an ape. I just like the stock. Do your own DD and avoid the fake new and/or resurrected accounts here and the manipulative Media.
ROBINHOOD IS A CHICKEN
This is my theory and analysis by autist.     1. On Wednesday, Hedge fund saw that they might go belly up and lose the billions. The only solution they saw was to restrict retail traders, who trade on Robinhood overwhelmingly. They asked in whispers IF Robinhood should put restrictions on these stocks. The reason can be formulated by the team of lawyers later. They knew very well this will upset the retail traders and might create an exodus of retail customers from Robinhood. 2. Hedge funds have few hundreds of millions in investment in Robinhood. HF realized it's okay to lose millions and save billions. HF might lose everything if the stocks ($GME etc.) continue to the ride to the moon. Hence the blockade.  This is a classic example of when Robinhood could stand up for us to the bullies and say   TIMES UP ITS TIME FOR DEMOCRATIZATION   But they didn't and here we are.     I am moving everything out of Robinhood and I want them to go belly up. That will be my sweet revenge.  At this point,   IF I LOSE OR WIN, DOESN'T MATTER. I WANT ROBINHOOD TO BE GONE FOREVER.
#Delivertheshares needs to be trending, SEC needs to enforce their own laws and make sure shorters are covering.
Are these HFs literally just going to just leave undeliveries and fake shorts with no punishment from the SEC? They have the rules laid out, just enforce them.   5million shares undelivered for over a month with no one to tell them to buy shares to deliver. Is the SEC saying they are allowed to just leave it as undelivered indefinately then till the share prices dip to $3? Are the HFs going to just wait till december and just cover for $3 each cause no enforcement from SEC? Man if I dont pay the bill for $30 i get my wifi or electricity shut off, come the hell on.   Also Someone enlighten me and why its not manipulation to trade stocks back and forth with the purpose of driving the stock down. Sounds like a direct purpose to manipulate and not based on free market supply and demand.    #Delivertheshares
AMC options this week
Listen here you little bitches .   I will give you updated calls and puts for today that expire this Friday 02/05!!!!!! (As of today, Monday)  Calls:.   almost   40$ calls  Over   between 20-40$  Over   at 20$  Too lazy too count but like   13-20$   Puts:  Most of them 13$ and less.    This fucking means we need  to not let these puts fucking print. We need to close above 20$.  If we close above 40$ by some Elon Musk miracle tweeter, MANY SHORTS WILL BE FUCKED.   There are many many people who bet on this going 20+ by Friday.   Hedges might've bought 40$ calls in advance for this week to hedge their shorts.   Someone smarter than me may come with some squeeze theories here, but these are the options as of today.   Also, someone bought 2m worth of calls today for 02/12 around lunch time I think striking at 20$
It‚Äôs nowhere near over
Short interest from NASDAQ reports at 121% from 1/29:    Only 20% of shorts were covered since the beginning, which leaves over   shares shorted as of 1/29  Hypothetically speaking, even if all of Monday‚Äôs volume was purely shorts covering (which it entirely is not),   still does not fulfill all of the outstanding float shorted.  Ignore all the media shills about shorts being covered and this being over, it is far from that and HFs are getting people to lose confidence and interest before they incrementally cover to cut losses.   It hasn‚Äôt even begun.
Will it print tendies?
Just wanted to reiterate this is what a bumpy ride looks like. We‚Äôve been here since the start, and we won‚Äôt walk away until we‚Äôre rich. GME

GME failure-to-deliver for Jan. 1-15 was AT LEAST   million
That post that claimed that 5 million shares of GME failed to deliver in the first half of the month was wrong (they made the big brain move of summing a running total). BUT, we can still get an idea of how many shares failed to deliver with some better math. Here's the data from the SEC (  Each Failures number is  previous day's failures + new failures - settled failures .  Date   Failures   Diff from Previous Day  -          - 1/4   182269   - 1/5   490723   308454 1/6   772112   281389 1/7   799328   27216 1/8   555658   -243670 1/11   703110   147452 1/12   287730   -415380 1/13   662524   374794 1/14   621483   -41041  We know that if  n  more shares failed to deliver on a given day than the previous day, then at least  n  new failures to deliver occurred (maybe more, but those got cancelled out by settlements). Therefore, we can sum the positive differences and get a lower bound on how many failures occurred.  Doing so, we get that   AT LEAST   million GME shares failed to deliver in the first half of January  . Remember, this is a   LOWER BOUND  , as we didn't count the failures that were cancelled out by settlements. It ain't the 5 million that the other math whiz calculated, but   million ain't nothing to sneeze at.  What does that tell me? HOLD BABY HOLD!  Disclaimer: this is not financial advice, position is 78 GME @ $25.

SHORT THE MSM NEWS, TICKERS: VIAM, CMCSA, T (Owners of CNBC, CNN, CBS and more)
Don't actually short until the moment happens, GME needs to be seen thru to the end first. I know im willing to put my future GME YOLO tendies to this cause.  But put the non-mainstream news attention on THEM. Tickers are as follows, see how convoluted the ownership is, they don't want you to easily remember it. These guys have chosen to speak on behalf of who we are fighting.  CNBC -> NBC Universal -> Comcast ($CMCSA)  CNN -> Turner Broadcasting -> Warner Media -> AT&T ($T)  Fox ->  Fox Corporation ($FOXA)  CBS -> ViacomCBS ($VIAM)  As another retard here put it, MSM news as we know will not exist by this decade's end. Say what you want about Trump, but his "Fake News" slogan caught on because everyone already knew what behavior he was referencing, it just didn't have a collective title yet (such as Karens).  Their propaganda on both sides has only gotten more blatant and its frighteningly working. Since when did people become so brainwashed that a valid political strategy during election night for the most powerful position in the world was: "Stop the Vote!" and "Count the Votes!"????????? It's easier to accept that Trump was just that stupid, rather than know that IRL it's so beneath the president that Trump isn't even aware of that strategy. The big flu has only encouraged both sides to be so stuck in a thought bubble they literally can't even process what the other is saying.  Thats just how low they think of the population, the same people who now own more than 100% of existing (and counterfeit) GME shares.     Brokers are failing to return OUR stock to us that THEY DECIDED TO LOAN TO MAKE $$$. Shares missing in the millions now, and given our holding of the line shown by the trading volume so far, just know that what is publicly known so far is just the tip of the iceberg.     The above article was written on Nov 30th, 2020, about 2 months ago.  You dont need to be a CFA to know that systemic risk (not just VIX rising, but reaching as far to private equity) causes a reaction from the entirety of wall st. Especially when people are to blame rather than a virus. Size is moving in the public markets and also the private ones. Being the owner of information is intangible value without a $ limit, depending what you can do with it. From publishing and running a storyline to keeping things a secret for a little longer (Epstein). Again, news as we know it will not exist in a few short years. Who knows what the catalyst will be.
Robinhood raises another $  days after receiving $1 billion from investors

Not going to like today really shook me, we weren‚Äôt green once!! It seems like the brokers limiting really screwed us over and it doesn‚Äôt look like they will be letting go of limits any time soon...  I‚Äôm in need of some positive reassurance and I‚Äôm sure a lot of others are!! How is this looking for us now? Will the gamma squeeze thats   SUPPOSED   to happen tomorrow help? And even if it does can‚Äôt they just drive the price back down because of low volume?

How hedge funds can close position without affecting the GME volume
So I am a smooth brain retard who doesn‚Äôt know much but I was curious as to how can short interest decrease when the volume was so low.  Turns out Wall Street has a technique called ETF Stripping, where they can buy ETFs with significant allocation to GME, ‚Äòstrip‚Äô GME stocks and use those shares to close their positions.  You can find more info from this      PS   : As I mentioned I am not an expert. I will urge industry experts to correct me if I am wrong or expand this post by adding more context in the comment section.

FAILURE TO DELIVER
Fails‚Äìto‚ÄìDeliver ‚Äî The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares.  Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a ‚Äúbuy‚Äìin,‚Äù and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.   Market makers have special exemptions from the rules:   they are allowed to carry a naked short for up to 21 trading days   before they have to borrow a share.   When the share is not borrowed in the allotted time and a buy‚Äìin does not occur, and they rarely do, the naked short becomes a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver (of the borrowed share).‚Äù  __Trading amongst themselves (short ladder attacks) will reset that 21 day timer.__ They can keep rolling counterfeit shares.
Scam bot warning
@SEC just a heads up to maybe do your fucking job. Look at Fidelity buy/sell ratio today, RH volume (even worse AH) and they want us to believe the price actually dropped by 100%. Put them in jail and give us our FAIR share of tendies already.

IT AIN'T A LOSS TIL YOU SELL PUSSIES
This too shall pass. WSB has not lost it's soul. It's going through a phase. Once the jonny come latelys fade off, the terrific loss and honest gain porn will return.
For now, hold your line on $GME.     The ones who bought at current top and develop tissuepaper hands as it approaches $150 in the next day or so will be too simple minded to show their loss porn and fade away.     Our proper retard and autistic bretheren will be holding the the pics of their wives boyfriends over their junk in one hand and their Robinhood loss porn in the other as they take a selfie in the Wendy's Bathroom on break of their next shift.

Why FUNDAMENTALS are sometimes ($GME) BS!
You might be hearing the word fundamentals a lot on CNBC and others and how Gamestop has terrible fundamentals.   Fundamentals traditionally are used to calculate share prices using financial data the company produces like sales, earnings, debt, investments etc.., so thats why they are calling us all out for being stupid cause GME isnt worth that much according to fundamentals.   The dirty secret is that fundementals is an arbitary made up set of rules, the price of a stock only changes on supply and demand, has nothing to do with fundamentals. If enough people think a stock is legit,   it does not matter  , no matter how bad the fundementals are. Thats the whole point of a free market.  There are countless examples of companies with bad fundementals sky-rocketing. Tesla being the most recent and greatest example. Enough people beleived in the company, therefore the shorts got squeezed all of 2020, even though the fundamentals did not improve relative to the share price.   I am in $GME cause I like the stock.   TLDR: Dont sell cause of stupid reasons you might have read in finance 101, the market determines price, nothing else.
Don't allow the Dip to shake your faith. Hold, my fellow Smooth-Brained Apes.
We Need the Same Outrage Over Ladder Attacks As We Had Over Robinhood Limiting Purchases
Just got off the phone with both of the Nevada Senators‚Äô offices. Every one of you needs to do the same.  When Robinhood restricted trading last Thursday, the reaction across the entire country was swift. So why the fuck have short sellers been allowed to continue to engage, in plain sight, in short ladder attacks for SIX FUCKING DAYS? It‚Äôs not even like it would be hard for the SEC to investigate, but shocker, they‚Äôre clearly letting it continue.  The fact that the same fucks who defunded the country in 2008 and made these risky bets on GME in the first place are now committing illegal acts in broad daylight is the biggest slap in the face yet. Call your Senators. Representatives. Governors. Blow up Portnoy, Chamath, Elon, AOC... maybe even Ted Cruz.         Position: 16 shares GME  Edit: As this post is getting a little attention, I'm including this really quality post on the same subject that provides a template to discuss 1) what is happening and 2) the specific laws demonstrating illegality, with your representatives.
Weedmaps, is the future Shopify of cannabis and potential multibagger
(Read the article for more, I'm too lazy) With the Democratic sweep, impending national cannabis legalization turbocharges this already sexy investment. More legal states = more cannabis retailers to list on Weedmaps = more revenue. Even better? I see a future where consumers buy their cannabis from local retailers in their state online via Weedmaps. The company is already profitable and has high brand equity with those who smoke the ganja. I posted about this SPAC around two months ago at $14 and it has since reached a peak of $26. At $20 where it currently stands, this a great time to jump in before the merge/ticker switches to $WEED. I see this stock reaching $50 before this Summer. Can't buy options, so I'm long 2,000 shares or you can buy the warrants.
FUD BOTS AT FULL BLAST
There are a ton of bots currently flooding right now saying to sell, gme is just a meme, your going to loose your money etc. But at the end of the day there is no evidence to back up those claims. At the end of the day today was one of the lowest volume days and your trying to tell me that they got rid of 50% of their short positions? Dont be a retard and believe that shit, the media is shilling so hard with articles like "Looks like reddit was wrong" "Why wall st bets should cut there losses and sell" Why are they pushing so hard for us to sell and buy slv which citadel is balls deep in.  Look at this graph retards   we are in the same exact shit that we are in from Wednesday and Thursday i do believe we will drop lower than on Thursday but go back up much higher. Also funny how there are shills on here saying "you should sell i dont want to see people get hurt we should just go back to wsb how it was" EXPLAIN TO ME WHEN THE FUCK PEOPLE ON HERE CARED ABOUT PEOPLE LOOSING MONEY WE LITTLERALY LOOSE MONEY ALL THE TIME ITS CALLED LOSS PORN.   The shilling on here is getting to level that makes my blood boil. Its one thing to give a reason to sell but when we are so close to mars people saying to sell with no reason are literally paper hand retards, salty boomers or citadel interns/bots.   Im not the most educated stock trader but I know shills and bootlickers when I see them. All ive seen from this community is facts and reason why we would short squeeze gme when you look past all the memes. The only thing people that are saying to sell have quoted is media articles with no sources and stupid shit like "wElL gAmE sToP iS gOiNg OuT oF bUiSsNeS" "sElL bEcAuSe ThE eXpErTs SaId To".  And even in the daily discussion page so many bots are saying to buy some random as fucking stocks with 10% shorts lol saing its the "new" gamestop. HOLD AND BUY TOMOROW I WILL BE DOING SO Or if you dont have any money just hold but dont fall for these retard bots  Thank   Im a autist and cant read so I a do not give edvice cause i like OJ Simposn
Scared, but fuck it HOLD!!!

REINFORCEMENTS INCOMING: BALD GOD IS IN DA HOUSE RETARDS
Please stop promoting Belfort
I get it, a famous person doing memes in our favor is fun. We all love the wolf of Wall Street movie. But let‚Äôs be real here.   Belfort is the epitome of what we‚Äôre up against as retail. He‚Äôs a convicted con artist who actually did so much fucked up shit he didn‚Äôt just get a slap on wrist from the SEC, he actually went to prison.   He was just anti-GME a few days ago, and now he‚Äôs meme-ing in its favor? A meme repeating the sentiments being echoed in this sub?   It‚Äôs pretty clear to me. Belfort came to the realization that this is the next generation of decentralized hedge fund. There‚Äôs power when a bunch of apes all like the same stonk. He sees the popularity and realizes the potential and impact that crowd sourced DD will do. He knows communities like this will grow. And he wants to use you.   this is nothing more than seedy opportunist bullshit because Belfort realizes you‚Äôre the exact type of person who makes him rich- a retard who yolos into risky investments at the idea of massive % gains. he wants to capitalize on the popularity of GME and this sub. He wants to sell you his shitty motivational book and the idea that he can teach you how you can be rich and famous with his ‚ÄúmiNdSeT‚Äù when really he got rich by scamming people, and famous for being caught.   Please. Stop. He is not your friend. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see him try to leverage popularity gained here to a ‚Äútrading community‚Äù of his own:   > ‚ÄúBelfort will share his favourite market sector in ‚ÄúWolf Report‚Äù and give 10 lessons in ‚ÄúWolf Mentality‚Äù, which includes tips on ‚Äúwhat it takes to be a trader, how to handle emotions, the intangibles of success, how to take advantage of opportunities, and how to learn from your mistakes‚Äù.‚Äù     Yeah, how about you eat my stinky dick instead. I want nothing to do with this shit and this sub should not be strengthening any kind of association with criminals of the finance world.
I don't have a problem with this email - if it's true, it's true. But this shouldhave been sent out before everyone woke up to see new restrictions.
How to actually f  k the hedge funds over
Someone just posted that lots of $800 calls were bought with 3/19 expiry:      Another post mentioned that short interest is down but why it might be misleading:      What do these 2 posts have to do with what I‚Äôm abojt to say? Basically it is extremely likely that hedge funds are literally hedging their short positions by buying calls at $800 strike ($25M worth of calls according to that first post I copied).   This is a huge opportunity to make them eat even larger losses.   1. They haven‚Äôt really covered their shorts (by closing their original position). Therefore, they will continue paying interest to short GME and how long is that sustainable?  2. They ‚Äòcovered‚Äô their short position by buying $25M worth of calls, which we could make worthless if GME doesn‚Äôt reach $800 by 3/19.  But what if GME goes to $400+ or IV goes up so that they sell their options at a profit? Good question.  This is the main problem, but to counter that we do exactly what we‚Äôve been doing - HOLD AND BUY AT DIPS ONLY. This means GME‚Äôs stock price should be relatively stable and as a result hedge funds will lose on both their short and long positions.   I know this means GME won‚Äôt go to the moon until 3/19, but after 3/19, it will moon like crazy because hedge funds will take a huge hit. You‚Äôve already seen that screenshot of Melvin, Point 72 and Citadel taking double digit losses in January. Let‚Äôs make it triple digits!!  TLDR: To make the hedge funds lose, we keep GME stock price stable. To do that, hold and buy at dips only.
Fuck you Melvin I won‚Äôt do what you tell me.  ü§å
Well if I can hold so can you! Don‚Äôt let them win! But seriously guys don‚Äôt let them win... please...   üèΩü§öüèΩ

Robinhood üçÜ
A note from WSB  Hi Robinhood,  We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is r/wallstreetbets‚Äù   We understand that the temporary limits you placed on certain stocks this past week was due to the fact that you can do whatever you want and face no real consequences, especially since you built Robinhood to take advantage of young idiots like us. We have always sought to make ridiculously high risk yolo plays based on emotions and we will continue to do this because we are degenerate knuckle draggers.   To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we listed a few points about ourselves below.   For WSB to operate, we do not need a collective motive. We called u/deepfuckingvalue stupid for months before he unlocked green mode.   We dont need to have a reason to jump tits deep into a stonk, and although you want to think this was a coordinated attack, most of us can barely read. We also dont have deeper level cognitive abilities here. We had a guy drink his own urine for nothing more than fake internet points.     Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, we gained over 5 million subscribers. Despite the media narrative, this is not a political movement. This isnt occupy wall street   This is a collective of the kids who ate glue and paint chips as children, and like a blind squirrel we found this nut.    We hope you take away this: at r/wallstreetbets we are nothing more than everyday smooth-brains participating in the markets. Standing by our WSB community means this. We will die holding these shares for nothing more than the ability to say fuck you. We have done a lot more in the past for much less in return.  If you think we are scared to lose money by being dumb, you are wrong. Thats who we are.   Thank you for sucking our dicks. My wife‚Äôs boyfriend tells that feels good  Sincerely,  WSB

At least   49% of all trades from   havent been made by Retail!
So i had my little Michael Burry moment or i am just a stupid ape, but ive  . Thank god its just numbers!  As ive been sitting today from market opening and looking at   for hours on end having my small Rainman moment, ive noticed that a lot of those trades had 3 or 4 decimals, which indicates that those trades couldnt have been done by us retards.  Anyways, 1989 trades made between     today had 3/4 decimals which tells us that at least   48,99%   couldnt have been made by retail. Also not every Fund will buy/sell with 3/4 decimals, so we can probably assume the number to be higher.  Well i dont know shit about shit, but it still looks like we are holding strong and they are just still postponing the inevitable.   So boys      @
Wallstreetbets GameStop Stock Drama Becoming Two Different Movies
Why short squeeze in $slv would never work. You are being manipulated by wall st banks and hedge funds if you buy silver because you think 'wsb' has set its sights on slv for a short squeeze. The media is lying to help their hedge fund friends.
Why short squeeze in $slv would never work. You are being manipulated by wall st banks and hedge funds if you buy silver because you think 'wsb' has set its sights on slv for a short squeeze. The media is lying to help their hedge fund friends.    Slv etf is not like other stocks. They can create and retire shares at will.  The way it works is authorized investors are able to buy baskets of 50k shares in exchange for the equivalent delivery of silver bullion.   This delivery to the slv trust creates shares.   These authorized participants can also buy 50k shares and retire them in exchange for silver bullion withdrawal.  If the etf becomes over valued, an authorized participant can buy silver on the open market (or go to their vault where they have the physical silver purchased already at a lower price) and deliver it to slv trust to receive 50k shares which they can then sell at the over valued market price risk free Arbitrage.   It seems like some hedge fund is trying to unload silver in mass and is using the hype around wsb as a Catalyst for a price run-up.  Not investment advice.
Alright everyone, iv been patiently waiting for this GME ride to end so I could post this CRSR dd. It's time. Get on board the hype train.
They are currently 81% shorted and are a solid company. Earnings coming soon. Whole market down and just a handful of stocks green from last week...Corsair (CRSR) one of them  They've been trying to short corsair and keep it locked in for weeks. Probably to buy before earnings cheap. They deserve the real boost before earnings. I will admit if it goes up it would benefit me, but I also have been watching them short this for months and it's making me sick.    Watch how quickly the billionaire short bots try to spam this with negative comments

Technical Analysis of GME and Reality Check
Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, and nor am I writing this as financial advice. This is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with GME. Many of you will hate my perspective. You will call me a (insert rainbow + bear emoji (I am write these on word so yeah)), you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud. But all I am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into. And sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective.   I also want to say that I am extremely proud of this sub. This sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter. However, this is a sub that was built on Due Diligence, Degenerate Trading, and Crazy Gains and Loss Porn. And to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of.   However, the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the MOASS. Which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so. This was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading. I for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you. And like many of you I made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of January, it is life changing money.   There is an old saying in the industry and within trading, that you ‚ÄúRide the trade, until it doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore‚Äù. And I am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point. So below you will find my technical analysis on GME and why I feel like it might continue its downward trend. This is of course is subject to change, and just my observations. I hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts (Technical Analysis).   My Technical Analysis approach: I am an intermediate term momentum trader. This simply means that I am trying to trade for the next 5-15 days. The tools I use are the following:  ¬∑ RSI: Measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum.  ¬∑ MACD: This is trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security‚Äôs price, and helps you understand the momentum of a stock  ¬∑ Volume: Speaks for itself  ¬∑ MVWAP & SMA: Helps Identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorter-term trend. (MVWAP: Pink Line, SMA: Teal Line)  I usually use a mix of the 15 & 30 Minute chart paired with the 1 Hour to identify patterns within the market.  Chart (A): Below you will find the 15-minute chart, that spreads over the past five days of trading. Each data point represents a 15-minute segment of trading. The Black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent pre-market and after-hours trading.         Tuesday of Chart(A) shows extremely bullish pattern being built late Tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours. This was the culmination of Papa Elon, and Camath chipping in their two cents on twitter, along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers (This very well could have been Melvin and the early shorts covering their positions). Additionally we can see that the VWAP and SMA are diverging further apart (Bulllish). The MACD is showing the same as well, with the Histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well (Bullish). And despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on Wednesday we still managed to end the day ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù. However, we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff, and we all know what happened there after.   Ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid / ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session. Clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock and/or there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes. Either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security.   Furthermore, we can see that during the Thursday trading session that three bearish events occur; 1) the MVWAP and SMA begin to diverge, 2)MACD Plummets with a bearish signal line crossover, and 3) The RSI Plummets to sold territory as well.   To further support my hypothesis, I have included the 1 Hour chart as well        As we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term (1 hour Chart). Only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period (1 hour intervals), and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading. At this time, we can see that the MVWAP and SMA have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence. That the RSI has neared ‚Äúoversold‚Äù territory (anything below 30 is considered oversold). And finally, the longer term MACD is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside.    As I said earlier, ‚ÄúYou ride the trade until it doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore‚Äù. And based off my research I can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside. Which is why on Friday I started to trim most of my positions in GME, it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security. Today I trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from GME at this time.   I hope I am wrong. I hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon. I would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another Gamma  . But right now, from my point of view that is not where we are.  Again, these are just my observations and I know a lot of you will find this offensive. But if you are going to trade or invest, you have to remove your emotions from the picture. Be a fucking robot.   For those that are going to ask the trading platform I use is Think or Swim.   Positions: No Calls left in the hopper, only shares about 1500 @ $19.
We had to take action: email blast from Robin-YourHood
A note from Robinhood Hi CxXxXXxXx,  We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: ‚ÄúWhy did Robinhood limit certain stocks?‚Äù   We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.   To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote a letter to our customers and captured the key understandings for you below: For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades. Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm‚Äôs customers hold. If a firm‚Äôs customers‚Äô holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements. Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood‚Äôs deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks.  We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations. We didn‚Äôt want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren‚Äôt trying to help hedge funds.  We hope you take away this: at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We‚Äôll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.  Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community. Sincerely, The Robinhood Team
Holding till the end!

GME -- S3 Partners ‚ù§Ô∏è HEDGE FUNDS
The CEO of S3 Partners Bob Sloan who reported that short interest in GME went down by nearly 80% over the weekend   LOVES HEDGE FUNDS.    His book   Don't Blame the Shorts   demonstrates his position to protect Hedge Funds.  ‚ÄúThe golden age for hedge funds is gone, but it‚Äôs still three times more lucrative than working at a mutual fund and most other places on Wall Street,‚Äù said Robert Sloan, managing partner of S3 Partners, a hedge fund risk management firm. ‚ÄúBut this shouldn‚Äôt pop up on the greed meter. They made money. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre supposed to.‚Äù  "While other authors point accusing fingers, in his book, Don't Blame the Shorts, Robert Sloan leaps to the defense of short sellers..."

The case for $WISH
For transparency, I am long on WISH stock. I am also not a financial advisor.  Context Logic Inc, ticker WISH, is a stable, competitive alternative to Ali-Express, that has (since IPO) seen a steady incline despite market fluctuations.   With record unemployment:    And Biden's plan to "buy American" paired with a new, stirred sense of patriotism amongst the lower to middle class, there is going to be an overwhelming influx of cheap, low cost, alternative household and every day goods. Now you're thinking, why don't they just go to amazon? Amazon's prices would be preferred had we not been in the midst of a pandemic and economic recession. The alternative to going broke is budgeting effectively, and we do that by slapping on the American brand name over cheap overseas goods. Does it matter where it was made if its from an American company? The vast majority of people wouldn't bother checking or caring.  Improving free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019? Check. Monthly active user growth rising nicely? Yes. Active buyers up compared to the year-ago period? Yep.  After a significantly underperforming IPO, in my humble opinion, the company is a 6-8 bagger by EOY.  Position: long 300 shares @

Without getting too political, think for a second about about not only buying christmas presents for your wife and her new boyfriend but the large scale economic growth caused by this kind of wealth transfer. Mark Cuban explained that no matter how rich he got he never needed more than a couple pairs of blue Jeans. Once a wealthy person has their basic needs met, their fortune typically sits there and collects dust and interest. Whereas poor people tend to spend all of their money stimulating the economy. Youre not holding a loss today because you didnt sell at the top last week. Youre holding onto the investment that will not only make you wealthier but make WSBetters around the world wealthier stimulating the economy. The contrary argument that we are going to crash the economy and the stock market is bullshit. If Melvin capital liquidates all of their assets tomorrow to cover their asses, every other firm has the opportunity to get discounted stocks and every diamond hand gets money for their priority need in life (cars, house, food, debt repayments). We are literally restarting the global economy from a less than pleasant flu. Load up boys, the world is watching to see what we are made of. This is the hill we choose. Apes strong together.   üåõ    üåõ   üåõ   üåõ      this is not investment advice I just did a bunch of acid and am attempting to describe what sounds taste like   Edit: comment below what youre spending the first share you sell at $  on, Im gettin a model S.
I PUT EVERYTHING I HAVE (AND MORE) INTO GME, AMC, NAKD, DOG-E.
This is a message to everyone that is contemplating selling or already has sold.  I just turned 27 last week right when this all started and for my birthday I got a knife in the back from Vlad Tenev, Robinhood and the suits.   I almost didn‚Äôt go to school because of money struggles growing up. It took me six years to get my bachelors degree: first community college then transferred to a university. I graduated two years ago and I‚Äôve been struggling to find a stable job and Covid did not help. I went through many interviews this year, but was denied over and over or positions were dissolved mid-way through the hiring process because of company redirection. It has really sucked, and I‚Äôm sure many of you have gone through same thing.   For nearly 2 months I was hovering around $100 in bank account and doing grub-hub to pay for my bills. In October I started working in a distribution center...busting my ass until I get a career role. Fortunately, I am in another interview process for an awesome company and position.  I know it‚Äôs irresponsible of me to throw everything I‚Äôve made over the past few months into these companies. But I believe in what is happening and this community. This is bigger than money. What the suits have done is unforgivable. Although I am still up pretty well, it does look bad right now, but we still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs gonna happen. I‚Äôve come to terms with the potential loss and all the work I‚Äôve done to get here, but I am HOLDING.  I have been in way worse financial positions and I‚Äôve always made it out. Robinhood chose not to do what was right. I will be okay and you will be okay.   Do what you must. Money will come and go. See this through. Keep those diamond hands.  This is not financial advice I just like the stock and love you all.

$FEYE Long and their earning come out tomorrow.
FireEye mainly does incident response which is when a company gets hacked and they want someone to come and figure out what happened so it doesn't happen again.   FireEye has the best incidence response for cyber attacks in the USA and were contracted heavily during the SolarWinds attack tens to hundreds of companies last quarter. They have seen some rougher quarters while dealing with debt and company reorganizations. They should post above expected earning this quarter which are released tomorrow after hours. Call options don't have crazy premiums right now especially for the ones expiring end of the week. (Feb 12 exp, 24 strike for $  right now). I think this can come close to 30 by end of next week.   Cybersecurity is becoming more valuable and WS is catching on. Incident response, a part of cybersecurity uses multiple technologies and does not get outdated as it is the process of figuring out how an entity was attacked and doing remediation's on that. This puts FireEye in a great spot to continue gaining business in this growing sector.   I'm long here and have call options for this Friday. (strike of 21 for $  - now

Good News for Nokia (NOK) and Decoupling from GME
Hi Everyone,  This morning we got some good news for Nokia. We got an upgrade from to a buy after the Ericsson quarterly results. And other assorted good news below                 This bodes well for Nokia's quarterly report on 2/4/2021. Mind you, it doesn't automatically give us a win but this is a good sign. It also gives us a little insight into the sector and it looks to be doing well according to Ericsson.  We also got to see something a bit unusual today. Since NOK was thrust into BANG a week ago its been trading in lock-step with GME and the others.      For the first time today we saw a much needed decoupling. GME (unfortunately) was down for the day and NOK was up. They did move together at one point but then started to diverge towards EOD.  I think if the run on NOK is to be successful it needs to distance itself from GME's gravity.  As we start   up closer to earnings  I want to remind everyone try not to sell for pennies and hold. That's the only way we are going to get North of $10 and breath much needed life into this stock.   TL;DR  Gud news make NOK NOK go Brrrr   This stonk has more shorts than you think   This stonk can move like a demon when buyers jump in   Earnings on the 4th will let us know if the hype is real. A lot is riding on this   Dont sell for pennies what you can sell for DOLLARS   My position is   of stock with 5k more dry powder   ü§öü§öü§öü§ö =         I am a not a BOT.      This is also not financial advice.
Bloomberg and other media is trying to tell us that it‚Äôs over and short interest for $GME has dropped all the way from 120% to 39%. ‚ö†Ô∏èThis is false.‚ö†Ô∏è That massive amount of short closing would show as a MASSIVE increase in volumeüìà and MASSIVE increase in stock priceüìà BUY THE FUCKING DIP
Stop holding because you think you‚Äôre part of some movement.
There is no movement. Stop acting like a little bitch and lose tons of money to help some sort of cause that doesn‚Äôt exist. Yea hedge funds got fucked. That‚Äôs because they overexposed themselves to a short position on a stock that was fundamentally undervalued. At this point the short squeeze is over. If you keep holding you will lose more money. If you‚Äôre fine with losing money to support ‚Äúthe cause‚Äù then that‚Äôs okay but if you can‚Äôt afford to lose any more money then sell.
I will continue to HOLD BUT will NOT BUY more UNTIL...
Congress + SEC MUST looks into how and why they are able to borrow 100%+ shares Why old Wall street was able to prevent retail buyers from entering the auction that Old wall street was able to participate in! I feel like its an injustice and discrimination of the classes! The WORLD is looking at us right now and we are suppose to be the face of what financial markets are about. If the markets were fair and efficient the auction would continue until both parties are satisfied. Until they make that happen ! I will not buy one more single share because as it stands the market is rigged. I'm proud of us apes we where able to pull it off last week. It was taking off ! But they took out our astroNUTS !!!!!!! I'm still holding   ü§≤  my shares hoping that the day comes when they deal with the root problem that prevented us from participating. They will need to buy my shares at their true price in a transparent auction  based on shares outstanding and not MADE UP shares they are technically printing money right ???

Volume based TA
This is a quick post to show my drawings that I did with whats left of my edible crayons. The main thing I want to key in on here is how volume weighted price levels effect market psychology and momentum. I'm not really trying to make price predictions, just trying to give some basic education to the noobs.  The yellow moving average in this first chart is VWAP (volume weighted average price). For those that don't know, VWAP basically takes the average price over some period of time and then normalizes it by how much volume occurred at various levels over that same period of time. VWAP is interesting because it helps understand who is in the drivers seat w/ regards to momentum (ie if price is above VWAP then majority of bulls are ITM and feeling good but if price is below VWAP then longs are in the red and shorts are ITM). As you can see, price broke above VWAP in the pre-market on the 26th and then shit got wild. Then price broke below VWAP on the 28th and we still haven't recovered back above it.   At this point VWAP is going to act as a sort of resistance and the reason why makes sense when you consider the psychology of market participants. If you imagine VWAP representing the level where the most amount of buying has happened, then you can imagine that as we retrace back up to VWAP traders that have been in the red are suddenly coming back to break even. As they get back to break even some people might decide to cut their losses and sell. This is why we often see large moves followed by a touch back to VWAP and then resumption back in the same direction as the original move (hard to see on this chart but this happened at 9am on 1/28).     Ok, now we're going to look a slightly more fancy VWAP. In the chart below I added in an anchored VWAP which I anchored to the top of the pre-market move on the morning of the 28th. This is basically representing the obvious that since that point around $480, most buyers are underwater. Intuitively it makes sense that it is above the normal VWAP because the normal VWAP is accounting for buying that happened at lower prices (before the spike up to $480).      Ok, personally I find this final chart most interesting and IMO it suggests that we might revisit the $80 range. This is called volume profile and its basically just showing the volume of buying that occurred at different price levels. I decided to have it calculate this starting from the market open on the 26th (things really got crazy after that) through current -- admittedly starting it here was a little arbitrary but still informative.   Anyway, as you can see, the majority of the volume that has traded since then happened at $80. Then there was a secondary spike of volume around $330 and a tertiary spike around $240. These levels will also act as  sticky points moving forward for the same reason that VWAP will...psychology. Consider the current situation. price is above the 80 primary volume level but were clearly looking pretty weak and dropping back down. If you were a buyer at $80 you would still be ITM but you would maybe start to question the strength/outlook of this as you slowly watch your gains   you would even start to sell a bit while you still have profits to   think a lot of people would.  Something else to notice about this chart. Notice how there is a complete lack of volume between 190 and 150? I would expect price to move VERY quickly through this range as there isn't much prior action here. Given that we're already in the middle of this range after hours I would expect we hit 150 tomorrow (or tonight) and then maybe even closer to 80 tomorrow or the next as that will act as strong support.        TLDR: We won't see upward momentum pickup until we break above some of these key volume weighted levels. The reason is due to the psychology of market participants and the fact that most people are currently underwater and wanting to cut losses when price starts to get closer back to their cost basis.    THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER! This same psychology applies to large funds. They are so fucking deep underwater at the moment and when they start to get back to their cost basis they will take the opportunity to cover. In other words, the dip was   strong and the covering will start.      Hold strong retards. This isn't financial advice and i'm not trying to influence anybodies decisions in any capacity. These ideas are my own and you need to assess risk/opportunity for yourself.

Thinking Outside The Box
Seems like the hedge funds pulled some shenanigans on Thursday and moved their positions. I know people have some argument on trade volume but Barron's published an article wherein they discussed how Hedge Funds could have bought up ETFs in which GameStop was in and then redeemed the ETFs for all stocks in that ETF from the provider to cover their shorts.  Therefore no actual trading in $GME needed if done this way simply swapping ETF.  I have a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to the S3 release but we plummeted today - lets be clear.  From here on, it seems like we're waiting for the NASDAQ report on the 9th to have some more conclusive data on where the Hedge Funds are at. That's a long time to wait.  We need to stop posting loss porn and stop talking about holding and take an evening to discuss where we're at in this battle because it's extremely unclear in my opinion.  Would the ETF theory impact share price? Is there a way that they got out of their short positions regardless of trade volume? How will the put expiry impact price? How does the sudden influx of newcomers selling all their shares at the slightest dip reposition us? Could they create a self fulfilling prophecy against us as we did to them? How long can they bleed interest and is it cheaper than covering right now?   Seems to me that this could just be a slow bleed to the bottom if we're not careful and we begin really examining where we're at.

We all want to watch a good movie, don't we?
In these last days we saw a lot of things many of us didn't thought were possible. The free market is not free at all, the big players decide who win, the media all around the world is spreading fake news just to keep people from buying and holding GME. For history we need to be the winners of this war, otherwise a lot of hope will be lost and the boomers will never learn not to abuse their power.  What we are doing here is displaying fairness, displaying democracy, displaying that the little men can have the same or even more power than the big players. Future generations will look back at us and say ' These guys fuck' .  What they've done just shows how desperate they are. All they want you to do is to sell.  Today MGM announced, they will turn this whole thing into a movie.   Let's make it a good one.  Hold and buy my fellow retards.

This NEEDS to be answered for smooth brain   üèΩAPES like me. If the stock going down today is ‚Äújust manipulation‚Äù and not real, then how is stock going up not ‚Äújust manipulation‚Äù as well?
we may be retarded but this place is NOT an echo chamber of retarded. if people feel sad because the stock is down, then you shouldn‚Äôt be sitting here trying to convince everyone that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot real‚Äù. If it REALLY IS manipulation, then fine. I‚Äôll believe it for now...  But losing this war is something that people should be ready to deal with also. Pretending we are not losing is 10x worse than losing. But I guess it seems like we are winning. When the stock goes up that‚Äôs good right???

Email From Robinhood
A note from Robinhood  Hi Gay Bear,  We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: ‚ÄúWhy did Robinhood limit certain stocks?‚Äù   We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.   To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote a letter to our customers and captured the key understandings for you below: For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades. Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm‚Äôs customers hold. If a firm‚Äôs customers‚Äô holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements. Last week, in part due to volatility in some popular stocks, Robinhood‚Äôs deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks.  We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations.   We didn‚Äôt want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren‚Äôt trying to help hedge funds.   We hope you take away this: at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets. Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We‚Äôll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.  Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community. Sincerely, The Robinhood Team

Concerns about this sub. A cult-like mentality is starting to form. And its dangerous
So preface, I'm not a bot and my positions are short on the S&P 500. I think this GME squeeze will cause a liquidity crisis so the market corrects. So GME going up is good for my account.  I've been on this sub for a few years and its rise in popularity the last few weeks has brought some concerns to me. Namely that this sub has the potential to drive some serious cult like behavior.   This GME squeeze is an interesting story, it started out as a play to make a metric fuckton of money and has grown into some weird psuedo-social movement, or at least disguised as one. You have people new to trading (As seen by the constant questions asking basic questions about the market) on this emotional trip to steal from Wall Street and give unto themselves. In an era with a lot of uncertainty due to the rona I get it.   My concerns now is there seems to be a quickly rising culture of if you do not love GME you are a bot/dissenter/evil wrongdoer with the intent to take the ship down. And I agree there has been a lot of not so legitimate people here the culture is slowly turning to join the hivemind or go. I am already seeing people talking about "our next target" as if this is now some group intended to take down wall street from within.  This sub has made this short squeeze a little guy vs Wall Street thing, and while there is plenty of shady shit going on, people don't seem to understand there are institutions long GME, they want to take Melvins money just as much as you. It's a short vs long battle.   That whole Robinhood fiasco, it was a legitimate issue handled HORRIBLY. They ran out of money and were going to go insolvent, and they handled it quite possibly the worst way, adding even more fuel to this us vs them fire.  "It can't go tits up" -  Words someone says right before it goes tits up. A lot of you all will make life changing money off GME, and I am glad for you. But you also have to understand for a lot of yall, you're going to lose. The market giveth and the market taketh away. I've blown up my account twice so I've gone through the emotional rollercoaster before. I remember my first 10 bagger off TGT when $BECKY was memeing. I am worried that for those people this GME play goes tits up on, someone will wrongly focus that energy into being someone else's fault and not them not understanding the play they were making.  This sub has grown exponentially and the mods have been doing there best, however this one tweet definitely added fuel to the fire in my opinion,      I think this perpetuates the message that its someone else's fault GME went down today and that the "elites" are out to get us.  This is reminding me of an Alphabet soup themed cult. And we all see how that's going.  This sub was always about making money and being dipshits doing it. And I am worried that culture is going to transform into something much much worse. My biggest fear is that people who blow up their account off this play are taken advantage of by others and lead down some crazy shithead path.  Edit: I can't blame the mods for this. There is no handbook on how to handle every news outlet picking up your subreddit. They've been doing the best they can and I applaud them.
I‚Äôve see this before... Looks like we‚Äôre ABOUT TO GO TO INTERGALACTIC SPACE!!!   GME VS VW CHART. WE NOT SQUOOOOZE   SHORTS GOING TO IMPLODE!     WILL BE REWARDED!

If I had to hazard a guess I'd say that the hedgies had accounts created and ready to go as a part of the strategy, beyond buying accounts as we also have proof of.

Naked Shorts explained -- and why
Here's a possible explanation for what we're seeing:    Counterfeit shares?   Naked shorts?   5Mn Failed to Deliver shares in January?     Read: Naked Short Sales and Fails to Deliver: An Overview of Clearing and Settlement Procedures for Stock Trades in the US     "Two possible reasons for intentionally engaging in naked short selling are: (i) to short sell stocks that are difficult or impossible to borrow; and (ii) to conduct manipulative ‚Äúbear-raids‚Äù on stocks. When borrowing costs are high, market makers sometimes choose not to borrow and instead naked short   In such cases naked short selling, then failing to deliver is economically equivalent to borrowing shares at a zero-fee zero-rebate equity loan plus the expected cost of being forced to buy back the stock and deliver it (a process called ‚Äúbuying-in‚Äù). In difficult-to-borrow stocks, this amount can be less than the cost of borrowing."  "The Buy-in procedure, on the rare occasions that it is used, is unlikely to force a naked short seller to close out the FTD; the Stock Borrow Program effectively facilitates a zero-fee zero-rebate loan to the naked short seller; and the fees for failing are insignificant."  "Because the incidence of buy-ins is low and penalties for failing are small, naked short selling effectively is a way of short selling difficult or impossible to borrow stocks."     TLDR: this stuff's messed up and it could take months to unwind it all. Melvin and the other shorters get a   zero-fee loan   and can wait out for months.   And we need the SEC to look into this predatory practice.

"Don't die at the altar of what you believe should happen". Must read if you're holding GME stock
Just like you, I held my GME shares with the hopes that I would reach unfathomable gains (200%, 500%, 1000%) while profiting directly from the greed and arrogance of sleazy, fat-cat hedge funds. What a feeling.  Almost overnight, our success transformed u/deepfuckingvalue's humble internet-forum analysis into an international fucking movement and a rallying cry for billions of people to protest society's disgusting wealth inequality and for a moment, just a tiny moment, reap the rewards of a level playing field.  On Wednesday, Gamestop blew up and the stock went from 88 to 460 in a matter of two days. The MOASS was just around the corner, and tens of thousands of average joes were about make life-changing money off a ballsy play that turned out to be fucking right.  We all know what happened next.  R\ binhood, Web\ ll and other brokers halted all buying of GME, right at the very peak of the flood of buying and global unity. In other words, THEY CHANGED THE RULES OF THE GAME RIGHT BEFORE THEY LOST. We knew they would pull some shady shit (slander us on CNBC, lie about short interest, ladder attacks, etc, etc) but we never expected them to destroy the free fucking market as we know it.  And that is why I wrote this post and why I sold most of my shares Friday and today. I will die believing that GME would have hit 1000 if they did not do what they did on Thursday, but none of that matters now. What matters is that the game has changed, and anyone who hasn't caught up with the new rules are going to get screwed.  CNBC are a bunch of crooks, but when they said that people would lose money buying at the top, they weren't wrong. Even if the MOASS did happen, there would've been people buying at 800,1000 and selling on the way down.  I'm not going to tell you to sell, because you'll just accuse me of being a cuckolding Melvin intern, but if you bought in GME at 300,350,400 with money you can't afford to lose then I'm asking you to reevaluate the current situation compared to when you bought your shares and the likelihood of a MOASS.  Don't throw away your life savings just because you're angry. Don't double your student debt because you can't accept the game is rigged.     >"Don't die on the altar of what you believe should happen"  I'm still holding 25 shares and hope to God this shit still goes to $1000. But I'm no longer dreaming about 7-figure gains, I'm dreaming about Vlad, Steve Cohen, and all the other cronies involved being sent to jail. This isn't about money any more, it's about justice.  As long as we never forget what happened these past few weeks, how they fucked the law and average American in plain sight of the entire fucking world, then we are still fighting. Email your local congressperson, post about it on social media, delete R\ obinhood and W\ bull. Even if never see the MOASS, I'm still fucking proud of you lot for inspiring millions and standing your ground against all odds. For those of you still holding, good luck and godspeed.
Twinkies for Tendies: Long Thesis on Hostess Brands (TWNK) (Owner of Twinkies)
# TL;DR    Hostess Brands (TWNK)   has high (\~15%) short interest (more than AMC or BB) setting the stage for a short squeeze, additional upside from a gamma squeeze, is extremely memeable, AND has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation.    Not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade.     Twinkies to the moon:    # Intro  Sup guys. So I know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into. Unfortunately we probably won‚Äôt see a squeeze of GME‚Äôs magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare, but I think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit AND is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into. It has what the finance community call ‚Äúasymmetric upside‚Äù (more upside potential than downside risk), for the reasons I‚Äôll describe below.    So what‚Äôs the target?      Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: TWNK)   . You probably know them as the company that makes Twinkies, but they also make Cupcakes, DingDongs, HoHos, Donettes and Zingers (can‚Äôt make this up)‚Ä¶now they‚Äôre going to make us some Tendies‚Ñ¢ as well.  For some historical context, the company was private-equity owned for awhile and then went public via a SPAC in 2016 (before SPAC's were as cool as they are today). The previous owners have fully sold out now, so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and there‚Äôs no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales.  The company also has warrants from the SPAC (effectively long-dated call options) that trade under TWNKW. They trade as half warrants, so need two warrants to form one share and are ITM at $  per one full share and expire in November 2021.    So what‚Äôs the thesis?   We think there‚Äôs an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume. From a fundamental standpoint, the business is extremely stable (as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an LBO), and trades at a slight discount to its peers.  # Technical Thesis  1.   High short interest = squeeze opportunity   ‚Äì Roughly 15% short interest today, higher than AMC which is last reported at 10-15% (see end of post for reference) and BB at 5-10%. This seems low in comparison to GME, but again this company has no structural problems that we‚Äôre aware of (can‚Äôt really say the same for movie theaters or mall-based retailers right now) and has actually been performing pretty well. Also, anything above 20% short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world. This level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds. 2.   Limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover   ‚Äì Average 3-month daily trading volume of   shares (roughly 1% of the float). It would take about  13+ DAYS  for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume. Current $2bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the WSB pool of capital (especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in GME right now). If you‚Äôre looking for a bit of tendie diversification, this is the name. 3.   The potential for a Gamma squeeze is all further upside   ‚Äì There‚Äôs actually been option activity picking up on this company.    On Friday, Nasdaq reported that call options for   of underlying shares traded hands on TWNK. This is with limited mention of TWNK online thus far (based on my keyword search through reddit)    .  See  . Most of those options were sold OTM at the $  strike price. Things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity. In order to create the biggest upside, buying the highest strike call option is ideal. As the price moves closer to ITM on those options, the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge. The IV is still really low on this name.  # Fundamental Thesis  1.   Snacking continues to be king.   Large market, resilient, growing. 95% of   adults snack daily, and the average American snacks 3x-5x per day. The snacking category generates \~$150bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing mid-single-digits driven by the need for convenience as consumers (at least pre-COVID-19) are busier than ever. Lots of room for multiple winners in the industry, of which I think Hostess will continue to be one. 2.   Strong organic growth story  . Organic sales have grown \~6% per year on average over the last number of years. Hostess Brands is growing ‚Äì and likely gaining share. 3.   Strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials.   Some of you might be old enough to remember this but during 2012, when the company filed for bankruptcy (due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout), consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved Twinkies, triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of Twinkies.    At the peak Twinkies sold on Ebay for $22,000 (see article     .    4.   The acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 rides the healthy snack trend.   Voortman sells cr√®me wafers and sugar free cookies (new product categories for Hostess), and markets as having no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup, and no trans-fat (playing the ‚Äúbetter-for-you‚Äù snack trend). Voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in North America, and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging Hostess‚Äô existing distribution footprint. 5.   COVID-19 re-opening should drive a bounce-back in convenience store traffic, which is the company‚Äôs primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again (and thus snack more).   Management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel, which is a growing end-market and should rebound as the world re-opens. As consumers get back to their busy pre-COVID-19 lives, they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience.  # Potential Risks  1.   Changing consumer preferences, especially to healthy.   The recent acquisition of Voortman Cookies in 2020 allows Hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend. 2.   Pretty high leverage for a public company.   They have roughly $950mm of net debt, or \~4x leverage on Adj. EBITDA (Adj. EBITDA is a proxy for cash flow). This is pretty high leverage for a public company (but quite low in private equity land). Leverage increased to \  in the beginning of 2020 after the acquisition of Voortman Cookies (up from \  before the acquisition), but has steadily declined to \~4x today as Adj. EBITDA has grown. Given their cash flow profile, would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage. 3.   Customer concentration.   The Company‚Äôs largest customer is Walmart, which was \~24% of sales. Top ten customers accounted for \~62% of sales in 2019. Some risk with customer concentration, but Hostess Brands is such a well-known and entrenched brand that I don‚Äôt think retail stores will do anything irrational. 4.   Rebound of COVID-19.   Risk that COVID-19 cases rise again, possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores, increasing costs, or causing supply chain disruptions. On the flip side, the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more.  # Appendix      TWNK Q3'20 investor presentation  :     TWNK acquisition of Voortman Cookies investor presentation:       Reference for TWNK short interest:         Reference for AMC short interest of 10-15%:          Disclaimer: I own a position in the Stock (TWNK); Warrants (TWNKW); August 20, 2021 $  Call Options ( ; and August 20, 2021 $  Call Options (TWNK210820C20)         Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and is purely written for entertainment purposes. Please conduct your own diligence. Past performance is not indicative of future results.     # Conclusion  If you‚Äôre looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock, look no further. This stacks up as a much better opportunity than AMC or BB given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals. Also, we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices.     Again, this is not intended to distract from HOLDING THE LINE ON GME. This is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade (and hopefully does not require much capital). Bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts. More than happy to hear any feedback from you guys.
A letter from Robin Hood: More wishy-washy explanation: Let RH go broke
A note from Robinhood,     We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: ‚ÄúWhy did Robinhood limit certain stocks?‚Äù¬†     We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.¬†     To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote   and captured the key understandings for you below:    For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.   Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm‚Äôs customers hold. If a firm‚Äôs customers‚Äô holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.   Last week, in part due to   in some popular stocks, Robinhood‚Äôs deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks.¬†   We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations.   We didn‚Äôt want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren‚Äôt trying to help hedge funds  .¬†  We hope you take away this:   at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets  . Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We‚Äôll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.     Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.Sincerely,   The Robinhood Team

Why I think robinhood is lying
So robinhood supposedly ‚Äòran out of money‚Äô, and couldn‚Äôt afford to keep supplying shares, so they halted buy orders.  The problem is, if they truly ran out of money, why wasn‚Äôt buying halted altogether? Stocks like Tesla, apple, Amazon, etc, those all still continued to trade, meaning that they still had funds to clear.  Nasdaq posted an article on January 29th saying that the GameStop short interest was at    , and S3 Partners lost credibility in my eyes by contradicting themselves on the same day on a Sunday.  This is NOT financial advice, but what I believe is that the price is being manipulated as low as possible before they REALLY start to cover.  I only have 1 share, so I don‚Äôt really give a shit, I bought in at $376 on Friday and I‚Äôm okay with watching it burn to the ground.  If you have a lot of money invested, reconsider if you wanna keep all that money in there. If you wanna go full ape  üèº, go right ahead and support the cause   JUST BE READY TO RISK IT ALL

What if GUH was always right about those APL puts?
I know I'm retarded and so are all of you. I have a theory, so I'm going to need all of you to assemble your remaining brain folds and hear me out on this.  Before the GME squeeze, RH was an ally to the retarded retail trader.... Everything changed when the unthinkable happened and the ADHD autist stars aligned and we collectively found some stocks we really liked.  In light of this, it has got me thinking..... What if RH was implemented by the wealthy to see growth of this sub and open the floodgates of ridiculous trades. Not only do the wealthy profit on the retards in retail investing, but there is another key reason:  The wealthy can watch the sub and Fuck with peoples' lives as entertainment.  This brings up GUH... This hero was very vocal about his irresponsibility on his tit-leveraged YOLO. He also had lots of people telling him how bad of an idea it was for him to execute the trade, but STILL..... The man was stoich on those bad earnings report and the sanctity of his PUTs.   Now retard, listen..... Pretend you are wealthy af, watching the peasants make trades on their dinky platform and discussing them here with the other autists. Your wife is busy with her boyfriend, so you decide to open up WSB and browse. This is when you find ControlTheNarrative's thread.  You cackle maniacally and immediately start talking to your other rich friends about this retard, until it's realized that those APL puts will print because the Autist is right.  As a group of wealthy people with mr and Mrs whispers everywhere, it would be incredibly easy to imagine a scenario where they would be aware of this potential mass gain on the most retarded trade ever formulated.  Well..... As the wealthy, we can change his fate for our own entertainment.  Autists... It is imperative we recognize the information we have learned over the past week and realize that the commission free brokerage we've used has been an instrument of the people who have the capacity to control the reality of users like controlthenarrative.  What if he was right? What if that big YOLO you made that resulted in the devastation of your life was a result of your thread about the trade being read by a wealthy person who was willing to pay to a small fee to see your life go to ruins?  All the desperation I've seen from Wall Street, politicians, news outlets, etc.... I can't help but ask:  How long has this gone on for? How many lives have been affected at the hands of rich people with the same access we have and vested interests in the flagship trading platform?  You can't make me believe that the wealthy wouldn't take pleasure at bullying retail investors for their own entertainment, especially when they have the power to control the fates of any bets made.  Maybe GUH was on track to win a massive gain on ridiculous leverage and wealthy people caught wind and decided to do something about it?   Guys..... Maybe everyone should stop posting the YOLO's until after the trade is made?  Thoughts?
GME Fails-to-Deliver Trending Downward
NOTE: The most recent data is January 15th.  I was reading /u/johnnydaggers's post and wanted to mine the data myself a little. So being the sentient  I am I downloaded the SEC's fails to deliver reports and looked up GameStop and read it into an R script. The source is:      library(dplyr)     x1 <-  , sep=" ")     x2 <-  , sep=" ")     x3 <-  , sep=" ")     x <- rbind(x1, x2, x3)      failtd <- arrange(x, desc( , desc(      gme <- failtd[failtd$SYMBOL == "GME",] %>% arrange(      mean(df$ ,       plot( $ , "%Y%m%d"), gme$   And this gives    Here we see a trending downward from a rather ludicrious   million to 650,000 FTDs. Each point is the cumulative value.  Can anyone with a brain tell me what this means?
Fookin shark week over here

If I can hold 45grand. You can hold anyway. They playing with us 3 Prisoners dilemma. Stay strong and hold. I believe you retards.   üí™üí™
What is coming next  ‚ú® üèª ‚ú®
FOR RETARDS THAT CAN NOT READ: Open Google and search Volkswagen squeez. Look at the chart, look at the dates, compare to GME. We could fall even lower, we can only win by not selling! SOON  üèª   This month I have learned that the world we are living in is rigged. I have learned that the media that I was watching before are lying. I have learned that there are almost no consequences to market manipulation as it is cheaper to pay fines then actually lose.  I think as a community we have learned so much more about the financial system and who is and who is not on retail investor‚Äôs side.   I could never have imagined that the media can be so easily manipulated. Today‚Äôs news about the silver got me laughing good when I first saw it, but then I started to get worried. This kind of manipulation is hard to withstand, especially for small investors like us. A stock dropping from 350 to 188 is worrisome.   However it means only one thing, and it is that they are on their last days of existence. I have no idea what more shady manipulation they will come up with. But one thing is for sure, If everyone hold, there is just no way that they will be able to win it. I don‚Äôt care how much they manipulate us, how much they are paying others to say things. The only thing I care about now is that they lose and we win. They have not closed their positions, they have lost half of what they own. Think about stepping into their shoes, think about losing cars, yachts, wealth generally that everyday normal people will never have. I would for sure do anything in my power so that normal people would not take it all away from me. Think about how bad they will look for the rest of their lives if they lose to a bunch of retards on a Internet forum, they will not only loose money, but clients too.   What I am trying to say is that it is up to you now. It can even take a bit longer then we anticipated. However if you sell, you will lose, and if you lose other normal people will lose, and if normal people will lose then the wealthy hedge funds and wealthy greedy people will win. I could cash out now and still make about 300 percent, I have been thinking about it. I came to a conclusion that being retarded is what makes us so strong. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about small amount of money, I want to cash out big time, over 1000 USD per share big time. I want everyone of you to look at the Volkswagen chart when it squeezed. How many days it took, and how low it fell before that happened. If GameStop falls to 100 so be it, if it falls even lower, SO BE IT. you are in control, the only way out for them now is that everyone will just get tired of this and sell.  We could win big time here, we could tell this story years to come, sitting in the bars, sitting with our kids, sitting with our friends, and sitting here together. A community where people from all over the world came together and fucked over some wealthy dicks that feed on normal people like us.                           üèª  üèª  üèª  üèª  üèª  üèª  üèª  üèª  Love you all, do what you want this is not financial advice this is life advice, advice about becoming something bigger and risking it all. Thank you    Edit: grammatical errors, English is not my first language

Comprehensive GME Diamond Hand Strategy Guide
‚ÄúIf you   know   the   enemy   and   know   yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you   know   yourself but not the   enemy  , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you   know   neither the   enemy   nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù  - Sun Tzu  We're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.  What the enemy is doing:  1.    Price manipulation:    With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower. This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:    1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.     2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions.    3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.  2.    Media manipulation       1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting. They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:       1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -> We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all.       2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -> SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $  Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR.         3. "XXX IS THE NEXT GME" -> This is also a false narrative. NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!       4. Shorts have covered their position. -> Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.  3.    Breaking the law:    Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $  Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end. 4.    Social Media Manipulation:    Hedge Funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands. Some places they target is WSB itself, other stock trading subreddits, facebook, and on sites / apps like Webull and Yahoo Finance. Don't believe in random comments. Always believe in WSB posts with huge amounts of likes (top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here / by mods too to make sure they're factual)  5.    Their Current Strategy:    Wallstreet calls us "dumb money", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other "NEXT GME" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a "SQUEEZE" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse.        What we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.  1.    This is a movement:    This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.  2.    We are holding, and we're continuing to buy:    We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes. Also, we are continuing to buy calls on GME to increase upward pressure. No one here has stopped buying.   3.    Nuclear Bomb still undetonated   \ :\  Short Squeeze still coming, it hasn't happened yet. We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.  4.    Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:    It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Melvin down over 50% just this month alone. You think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees? Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired. 5.    We're not breaking the laws, they are:    Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of   6.    We're getting smarter:    Everyday we get new DD on WSB and more and more people are reading these DD's and understand how to diamond hands, and can now filter out fake news from mainstream media. We've just hit 8 mil subs; our subs are going exponential. We've recovered from the RH fiasco and we're primed and loaded on other brokerages like Fidelity. We are more ready than EVER to continue this war and this fight. 7.    An Ape's Move this week:    Again, not financial advice, but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape, the autistic ape would buy the dips, ESPECIALLY at this insane discount price of around $100. The autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the GME train past $1k, easily 10x their bananas. Those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month. The autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing, but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks. But the autistic ape will ask itself, is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas? Most apes will answer yes. But the ape knows if they buy it, they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month. But those red number are just fake numbers generated by HFT short ladder attacks, and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas, because apes together STRONK.   TL;DR =     üêµ =                                                        PS: You only lose if you sell. Stock stays down for a month, then rockets up in March = no loss, only historical profits for retail investors.
Loss porn but I'm not fucking selling
Hello friends.  Here's some loss porn to inspire you to keep fucking holding. We're all in this together, and please try to have a time horizon of more than 1 week.#DIAMONDHANDGANG
Some proper DD to explain why $NOK isn't a bot stock and you should actually pay attention to it.
I've been reading a lot of you posting about the fact that $NOK is a bot stock and that it's being posted to distract people from $GME.  Many people don't seem to realize it, but no smart investors put all their eggs into one basket.  I've got multiple large bets going at any given time, this way, if one doesn't work out, I can always bank on another one.     That said, here's why I decided to put 100k into $NOK.   This is not financial advice, do your own DD.      Let's start with financials:  The company has been working to grow FCF (Free cash flow) for the past couple of years and have delivered 5 quarters of positive FCF so far. Expected to continue this quarter.  Their operating margins have improved from breakeven in 2018 to just over 9% in 2020.  They are siting on a total cash balance of   over 8 billion dollars.    The market cap is 23 billion dollars. To put this in perspective. You're paying  $ per share for  $ in Cash + Nokia's assets.  The company's expected to reinstate their dividend.  We're paying \~1x sales to buy the company.  The board is authorized to issue or buy back up to 10% of the float. They have done neither.       The other reasons:    The Covid pandemic has actually accellerated spending on 5G infrastructure. $NOK and Ericsson have been large beneficiaries of this due to the security risks related to Huauei.  $NOK's reefshark chips help carriers reduce their costs (power demand is 64% lower for example). This has helped them sell more of their products, but they don't expect full adoption until 2022.  $NOK's been investing their money into R&D as well as into turning things around. They aren't just sitting on the side, they are working to become a major player again.  Total addressable market for this is expected to be $700 billion by 2030. It's currently $10 billion.  This is a 70x increase in addressable market, for which there are only a few major players.    The biggest risk:   Huauei is unbanned from use in the US.       TLDR:     My positions: 20k shares, with an average cost of about  $. I will be selling weekly covered calls at varying strikes, to take advantage of the high IV. I'm happy to be paid to wait.
I am not fucking selling!!!
GME long term story the media won't tell you. MUST READ!!!
Full Disclosure:  I am long 4600 shares since May 2020 and have not sold a single one.  The media is intentionally leaving out all the positive transformation information that is going on inside Game Stop.  What am I talking about you might ask.  Let me ask everyone this:  If there was a company that was experiencing 300% yoy ecommerce growth, closing unprofitable stores, start of a new console cycle, heading into a 200 billion TAM computer gaming industry and oh yeah, three new board members including Ryan Cohen would you say, "Hey this company has a great future?"   I'm pretty sure most investors would.  I know  everyone is looking for the big squeeze and you fucking retarded apes have done fantastic holding the line, however, there is a great long term story about to unfold here.  The current tradeable float is probably less than 10 million shares, more than likely closer to 5 million.  The institutions own over 100% and the current BUY AND HOLD strategy is working like a charm.  The hedge funds, market makers and brokerages have engaged in criminal activity to hold the stock down.  My point is, the company and Cohen hasn't said a word due to earnings coming up 3/25/21.  Just think what the stock might do if/when CEO Sherman steps aside and they announce Cohen as CEO.  Then Cohen announces his plan of how he's going to transform the company.  This is why I haven't sold along with the fact that I'm just a retarded ape like everyone else, but I really just like the stock.  Moral of the story is JUST BUY AND HOLD and good things are in our future.
Rolled my $gme calls into shares last week, stay strong üí™
Bought very high and have now suffered through two major loss days.... SO FAR. COME TAKE THEM FROM ME.
Baltimore is not Selling. Diamonds are forever.
I'm still in the black overall at least, I hope we can help out the people who bought high. Today's highs are tomorrow's lows?

Important to understand Equity reports to make investment decisions
I know there is a lot of misinformation on the internet, and new investors wonder how to make the right decisions. Here is some vital information that every investor should make. We hear on the mainstream media about fundamentals; they are essential financial statements that everyone should be familiar with.        Cash flow    Balance sheet    Income statement   These are like the bible to investing. Also, we can hear that equity research reports are bais information.   I recommend everyone to do their homework and read a lot about financial statements. So, you will not believe everything that is on the internet or any post, or influencer.   It is essential to have an investment strategy a portfolio well-diversified.      This is important to know:        Equity Search     Equity research is a discipline within the financial services industry, in which sell-side equity research analysts produce specialized research reports for buy-side investors and corporate leaders. Equity research plays an essential role in helping investors discover market opportunities and make informed investment decisions.           An equity research repor  t is a document prepared by an equity research analyst that often provides insight on whether investors should buy, hold, or sell shares of a public company. An analyst lays out their recommendation, target price, investment thesis, valuation, and risks in an equity research report. There are multiple forms of equity research, including (but not limited to):       COMPANY REPORTS   An update report that highlights the latest news, company announcements, earnings reports, Buy Sell Hold ratings, M&A activity, anything that impacts the value of the company       INITIATION REPORT  S A comprehensive company report compiled when an analyst or firm initiates their stock coverage. Initiation reports cover all of the company's divisions and products in-depth to provide a baseline of what the company is and how it is performing. Initiation reports can be tens to hundreds of pages long, depending on the complexity of a company.      What is Included in a Typical Equity Research Report?    Research reports don‚Äôt need to follow a specific formula. Analysts at different investment banks have some latitude in determining the look and feel of their reports. But more often than not, research reports follow a certain protocol of what investors expect them to look like. A typical equity research report includes in-depth industry research, management analysis, financial histories, trends, forecasting, valuations, and investors' recommendations. Sometimes called broker research reports or investment research reports, equity research reports are designed to provide a comprehensive snapshot that investors or corporate leaders can leverage to make informed decisions.   In conclusion: You guys have to read a lot and do your own research. Make sure it is a reliable source and learn to read between the lines.  Best of luck to everyone
Went ahead and made it a cool 100 shares. Tell me how retarded I am!
Pfizer stonk loss - yet another manipulated stonk
What is going on with GME
Source:     Im not a financial advisor this is mot advice. Just a detailed explanation of what i believe could be going on. This is not my words it is from an article. When i posted the link it was getting deleted so i posted the most important part   The Creation of Counterfeit Shares ‚Äî There are a variety of names that the securities industry has dreamed up that are euphemisms for counterfeit shares. Don't be fooled : Unless the short seller has actually borrowed a real share from the account of a long investor, the short sale is counterfeit. It doesn't matter what you call it and it may become non‚Äìcounterfeit if a share is later borrowed, but until then, there are more shares in the system than the company has sold.   The magnitude of the counterfeiting is hundreds of millions of shares every day, and it may be in the billions. The real answer is locked within the prime brokers and the DTC. Incidentally, counterfeiting of securities is as illegal as counterfeiting currency, but because it is all done electronically, has other identifiers and industry rules and practices,   naked shorts, fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, SHO exempt, etc. the industry and the regulators pretend it isn't counterfeiting. Also, because of the regulations that govern the securities, certain counterfeiting falls within the letter of the rules. The rules, by design, are fraught with loopholes and decidedly short on allowing companies and investors access to information about manipulations of their stock.   The creation of counterfeit shares falls into three general categories. Each category has a plethora of devices that are used to create counterfeit shares. Fails‚Äìto‚ÄìDeliver ‚Äî If a short seller cannot borrow a share and deliver that share to the person who purchased the (short) share within the three days allowed for settlement of the trade, it becomes a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver and hence a counterfeit share; however the share is transacted by the exchanges and the DTC as if it were real. Regulation SHO, implemented in January 2005 by the SEC, was supposed to end wholesale fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, but all it really did was cause the industry to exploit other loopholes, of which there are plenty (see 2 and 3 below). Since forced buy‚Äìins rarely occur, the other consequences of having a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver are inconsequential, so it is frequently ignored. Enough fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver in a given stock will get that stock on the SHO list, (the SEC's list of stocks that have excessive fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver) ‚Äì which should (but rarely does) see increased enforcement. Penalties amount to a slap on the wrist, so large fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver positions for victim companies have remained for months and years.   A major loophole that was intentionally left in Reg SHO was the grandfathering in of all pre‚ÄìSHO naked shorting. This rule is akin to telling bank robbers, ‚ÄúIf you make it to the front door of the bank before the cops arrive, the theft is okay.‚Äù Only the DTC knows for certain how many short shares are perpetual fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, but it is most likely in the billions. In 1998, REFCO, a large short hedge fund, filed bankruptcy and was unable to meet margin calls on their naked short shares. Under this scenario, the broker dealers are the next line of financial responsibility. The number of shares that allegedly should have been bought in was 400,000,000, but that probably never happened. The DTC ‚Äî owned by the broker dealers ‚Äî just buried 400,000,000 counterfeit shares in their system, where they allegedly remain ‚Äî grandfathered into ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù by the SEC. Because they are grandfathered into ‚Äúlegitimacy‚Äù, the SEC, DTC and prime brokers pretend they are no longer fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, even though the victim companies have permanently suffered a 400 million share dilution in their stock.   Three months prior to SHO, the aggregate fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver on the NASDAQ and the NYSE averaged about 150 million shares a day. Three months after SHO it dropped by about 20 million, as counterfeit shares found new hiding places (see 2 and 3 below). It is noteworthy that aggregate fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver are the only indices of counterfeit shares that the DTC and the prime brokers report to the SEC. The bulk of the counterfeiting remains undisclosed, so don't be deceived when the SEC and the industry minimize the fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver information. It is akin to the lookout on the Titanic reporting an ice cube ahead. Ex‚Äìclearing counterfeiting ‚Äî The second tier of counterfeiting occurs at the broker dealer level. This is called ex‚Äìclearing. Multiple tricks are utilized for the purpose of disguising naked shorts that are fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver as disclosed shorts, which means that a share has been borrowed. They also make naked shorts ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to the system so they don't become fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, which is the only thing the SEC tracks. Some of the tricks are as follows: Stock sales are either a long sale or a short sale. When a stock is transacted the broker checks the appropriate box. By mismarking the trading ticket ‚Äìchecking the long box when it is actually a short sale the short never shows up, unless they get caught, which doesn't happen often. The position usually gets reconciled when the short covers. Settlement of stock transactions is supposed to occur within three days, at which time a naked short should become a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, however the SEC routinely and automatically grants a number of extensions before the naked short gets reported as a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver. Most of the short hedge funds and broker dealers have multiple entities, many offshore, so they sell large naked short positions from entity to entity. Position rolls, as they are called, are frequently done broker to broker, or hedge fund to hedge fund, in block trades that never appear on an exchange. Each movement resets the time clock for the naked position becoming a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver and is a means of quickly getting a company off of the SHO threshold list. The prime brokers may do a buy‚Äìin of a naked short position. If they tell the short hedge fund that we are going to buy‚Äìin at 3:59 EST on Friday, the hedge fund naked shorts into their own buy‚Äìin (or has a co‚Äìconspirator do it) and rolls their position, hence circumventing Reg SHO. Most of the large broker dealers operate internationally, so when regulators come in (they almost always ‚Äúcall ahead‚Äù) or compliance people come in (ditto), large naked positions are moved out of the country and returned at a later date.   The stock lend is enormously profitable for the broker dealers who charge the short sellers large fees for the ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù shares, whether they are real or counterfeit. When shares are loaned to a short, they are supposed to remain with the short until he covers his position by purchasing real shares. The broker dealers do one‚Äìday lends, which enables the short to identify to the SEC the account that shares were borrowed from. As soon as the report is sent in, the shares are returned to the broker dealer to be loaned to the next short. This allows eight to ten shorts to borrow the same shares, resetting the SHO‚Äìfail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver clock each time, which makes all of the counterfeit shares look like legitimate shares. The broker dealers charge each short for the stock lend.   Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets ‚Äúlaundered‚Äù into a legitimate borrowed share.   Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting. This is a   of tactics used. For a company that is under attack, the counterfeit shares that exist at this ex‚Äìclearing tier can be ten or twenty times the number of fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, which is the only category tracked and policed by the SEC.   Continuous Net Settlement ‚Äî The third tier of counterfeiting occurs at the DTC level. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a holding company owned by the major broker dealers, and has four subsidiaries. The subsidiaries that are of interest are the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). The DTC has an account for each broker dealer, which is further broken down to each customer of that broker dealer. These accounts are electronic entries. Ninety seven percent of the actual stock certificates are in the vault at the DTC with the DTC nominee's name on them. The NSCC processes transactions, provides the broker dealers with a central clearing source, and operates the stock borrow program.   When a broker dealer processes the sale of a short share, the broker dealer has three days to deliver a borrowed share to the purchaser and the purchaser has three days to deliver the money. In the old days, if the buyer did not receive his shares by settlement day, three days after the trade, he took his money back and undid the transaction. When the stock borrow program and electronic transfers were put in place in 1981, this all changed. At that point the NSCC guaranteed the performance of the buyers and sellers and would settle the transaction even though the seller was now a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver on the shares he sold. The buyer has a counterfeit share in his account, but the NSCC transacts it as if it were real.   At the end of each day, if a broker dealer has sold more shares of a given stock than he has in his account with the DTC, he borrows shares from the NSCC, who borrows them from the broker dealers who have a surplus of shares. So far it sounds like the whole system is in balance, and for any given stock the net number of shares in the DTC is equal to the number of shares issued by the company. The short seller who has sold naked ‚Äì he had no borrowed shares ‚Äì can cure his fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver position and avoid the required forced buy‚Äìin by borrowing the share through the NSCC stock borrow program. Here is the hocus pocus that creates millions of counterfeit shares.   When a broker dealer has a net surplus of shares of any given company in his account with the DTC, only the net amount is deducted from his surplus position and put in the stock borrow program. However the broker dealer does not take a like number of shares from his customer's individual accounts. The net surplus position is loaned to a second broker dealer to cover his net deficit position. Let's say a customer at the second broker dealer purchased shares from a naked short seller ‚Äî counterfeit shares. His broker dealer ‚Äúdelivers‚Äù those shares to his account from the shares borrowed from the DTC. The lending broker dealer did not take the shares from any specific customers' account, but the borrowing broker dealer put the borrowed shares in specific customer's accounts. Now the customer at the second prime broker has ‚Äúreal‚Äù shares in his account. The problem is it's the same ‚Äúreal‚Äù shares that are in the customer's account at the first prime broker. The customer account at the second prime broker now has a ‚Äúreal‚Äù share, which the prime broker can lend to a short who makes a short sale and delivers that share to a third party. Now there are three investors with the same counterfeit shares in their accounts. Because the DTC stock borrow program, and the debits and credits that go back and forth between the broker dealers, only deals with the net difference, it never gets reconciled to the actual number of shares issued by the company. As long as the broker dealers don't repay the total stock borrowed and only settle their net differences, they can ‚Äúgrow‚Äù a company's issued stock.   This process is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) and it hides billions of counterfeit shares that never make it to the Reg. SHO radar screen, as the shares ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù from the DTC are treated as a legitimate borrowed shares. For companies that are under attack, the counterfeit shares that are created by the CNS program are thought to be ten or twenty times the disclosed fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, and the true CNS totals are only obtained by successfully serving the DTC with a subpoena. The SEC doesn't even get this information. The actual process is more complex and arcane than this, but the end result is accurately depicted. Ex‚Äìclearing and CNS counterfeiting are used to create an enormous reserve of counterfeit shares. The industry refers to these as ‚Äústrategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver.‚Äù Most people would refer to these as a stockpile of counterfeit shares that can be used for market manipulation. One emerging company for which we have been able to get or make reasonable estimates of the total short interest, the disclosed short interest, the available stock lend and the fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, has fifty ‚Äúburied‚Äù counterfeit shares for every fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver share, which is the only thing that the SEC tracks, consequently the SEC has not acted on shareholder complaints that the stock is being manipulated.  The Anatomy of a Short Attack ‚Äî Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail. The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain. When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.   Typical tactics include the following: Flooding the offer side of the board ‚Äî Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.   The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.   By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ‚Äústrategic fails-to-deliver‚Äù and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ‚Äúmask‚Äù the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.   Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to s  the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù parameters, the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands ‚Äî all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.   Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ‚Äúcrashing‚Äù the stock and a successful ‚Äúcrash‚Äù is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ‚Äústick‚Äù or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following: Media assault ‚Äî The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately purchase real shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These real shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.   The shorts have ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù reporters worked for The  , an Internet advisory service that hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.   One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair ‚Äî proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's  by a factor of one million times. This ‚Äúmistake‚Äù was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ‚ÄúDue to a mathematical error‚Äù appeared three days later ‚Äî after the damage was done to the stock price. Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The  , best described the media function: When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down ‚Äî it's a pretty good game.   This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air, however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The   have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.   Analyst Reports ‚Äî Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.   Planting moles in target companies ‚Äî The shorts plant ‚Äúmoles‚Äù inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media. Frivolous SEC investigations ‚Äî The shorts ‚Äúleak‚Äù tips to the SEC about ‚Äúcorporate malfeasance‚Äù by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ‚Äúconfidential inquiry‚Äù is leaked to the short media.   The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community. Class Action lawsuits ‚Äî Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors. Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. ‚Äî If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product. Pulling margin from long customers ‚Äî The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. Paid bashers ‚Äî The shorts will hire paid bashers who ‚Äúinvade‚Äù the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation.  This is not every dirty trick that the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.  TL;DR These funds will short sell the same shares over and over increasing the amount of ‚Äúconterfeit shares‚Äù and they will use all their power to use media to divert attention from illegal activities     Source

Do not fucking flinch - just advice.
Listen up, do not flinch. The price currently does not matter AT ALL - if anything, this is a plus. Just buy and diamond hand this. Citadel is currently hurting and desperate including other big firms shorting GME (keep in mind some big whales are still holding stocks for GME). What we saw today was the most obvious attempt at ping ponging the stocks between the shorters causing the price to fall even at such low volumes - Almost a disgrace to call this a volume, as it was almost no volume. Check out   for example.  The price is not reflective of the situation at all. And remember, why are all these things happening?     \- Tons of bots promoting anything other than GME.  \- Tons of news saying WSB was responsible for a surge in SLV and an apparent squeeze which will NEVER happen. Citadel holdst the 6th most shares in SLV.  \- Tons of TV-news reporting the same  \- The stock being sold way undervalue between hedge funds that have shorted the stock by over 110%.  \- Portraying us as lazy, greedy,  irrational and Alt-right people promoting GME     Do not fucking flinch. This was the most transparent the hedge funds has ever been by showing blatantly that they are naked-short selling and spam ping ponging the stocks. Fuck the funds and fuck the SEC. This is fucking it. Holding till 0 even though that is not possible.     As always this is just my opinion and I am not a financial advisor. Just a donut. Just over 40 at 140 and 142 at 330.     Edit: No need to message me. Everything you need to know is right in front of you in the front page. It is as simple as hold through it all.
Just bought more at the AH dip and my t-shirt arrived today. I‚Äôll wear it proudly as I‚Äôm NOT FUCKING SELLING.   üèΩ y‚Äôall!
It ain't much, but I am holding til' the moon and beyond!

Joke's on you Melvin, red is my favorite color
I am a boring, middle-aged man who has never bought any stock in my 40 years of life. I was inspired by y‚Äôall and decided to chip in and support y‚Äôall! I bought 10 shares today. I don‚Äôt give a shit to losing 1/3 of the value today. Together, we, the people, will win this war!!
So you‚Äôre telling me Gamestop is half off today? Thank you .

The Wolf likes the stock and is holding Posted 1:29 PM Pacific Time.
Bought in late? Up $2k in AMC at open? Holding and buying more! Down 31% on GME 45@$328? Still holding!! Keep your chump change. I‚Äôm a chimp & going to the moon!          This shit ain‚Äôt done yet.
Do you all notice the trend on WSB today? There's a lot of loss porn posts, do you know what that means?
That means that you pigs weren't happy with gains.  Downvote me, I don't care.  You guys had Melvin & Friends    down 50 BILLION DOLLARS   , and now, that sweet sweet money you   right back in their pockets, because you didn't put any in your own.  Yeah, they manipulate   Yeah, they cheat   Yeah, they are crybaby dirtbags  But, they know how to make money, and you don't.  Nobody went broke taking profits.  Before this happened, this was a sub of 600k beautiful degenerates who know how to make and lose money, in fun ways we could laugh at each other for "GUH".  Now it's full of diamond-handing sheep following a fake trend.  Bears make money, Bulls make money, Pigs get slaughtered. That used to be a motto here. Time for you new guys to learn.  This is how WSB was originally.
A reminder: Volkswagen share prices in the similar 2008 scenario saw similar rises and falls prior to peaking. Whats going on right now is nothing more than a cornered wild animal (hedge funds) fighting until their last breath.
If I can hold you can hold tooo   is with you guys.
HOLD STEADY FAM DON‚ÄôT LET ME DOWN      üèΩ
Diamond Hands is Bull Shit
Some real talk. Don‚Äôt stay married to a thesis or idea.  The only real arbiter of truth is price and your PnL.  I‚Äôm not here to shill. I‚Äôve been through this. Once everyone gets too lopsided in a trade, they get killed.   If you made your money already, great. Create a plan and stick to it.   WSB has a tendency to be hivemind and celebrate loss porn. They celebrate following consensus.   For the 1 person that has gains, there‚Äôs 1000 that got wrecked. It‚Äôs fucking hard to make money. It‚Äôs like the one kid in high school who pauses for a second to do something different and everybody loses their mind and harasses that person for not being one of them.  Once the sharks have their fill, not much is left.  People want to be a part of something more, to be part of a movement. I get it. There‚Äôs other ways of creating systematic change and leveling the playing field.
Only those with real        will be able to board the      that shoot past Melvin and RH's price BARRICADES !!
My $1700 loss on GME is < Melvin's $6,360,000,000 loss. ü§£  ü§≤

‚ÄòMeme Stock‚Äô Volatility and the Real Winners
First of all, this is somewhat of a long post and I hope you all enjoy it. I hope this can start some discussion.    Tldr:   The 'Reddit Raid' has impacted the overall economy in positive ways that we could not have predicted. We have been the lifeline that these companies needed. $AMC and $GME have benefited greatly from the rise of their common equity.   Winners: Institutional Investors, Companies, Employees, Real Estate (and local communities).    Over the past 2 weeks we have seen retail investors from around the world making significant gains on various ‚ÄòMeme stocks‚Äô. Stocks like $GME, $AMC have seen massive price appreciation as the under-served and under-represented members of society have found a new interest in investing. News outlets continue to post sensational articles on individual people becoming rich overnight because of early investments in these companies. However, the real winners out of all of this are the companies themselves, various institutional investors, employees of these companies, and real estate companies (and local communities).    Winners      Institutional Investors:    Silver Lake Partners ‚Äì Silver Lake Partners is a private equity group that up until recently, had been a credit investor with $AMC. Originally owning $600 Million worth of convertible bonds back in 2018, Silver Lake disclosed on Friday January 29th that they had converted their $600 Million worth of bonds into $AMC shares and subsequently sold those shares for a $113 Million profit. This convertible bond event also dramatically benefited $AMC through the obvious reduction in debt during a tenuous operating environment (more on that later).  $GME Shareholders ‚Äì It may be a surprise to many media outlets but institutional investors have made a sizeable gain when it comes to $GME shares. Fidelity, Black Rock, and Vanguard own  ,  , and   of shares outstanding respectively. This has led to a gain of $  Billion, $  Billion, and $  Billion respectively for each of these institutional investors.   Ontario Teachers Pension Fund ‚Äì The recent retail action in favour of mall REIT Macerich ($MAC) led to the largest shareholder; the Ontario Teachers Pension Fund, cashing out for $500 Million which has helped boost capital available for the pension obligations of the teachers paying into this pension fund.    Companies:    $AMC - Due to the convertible bond action I highlighted earlier with regards to Silver Lake Partners, AMC saw an immediate reduction in the company‚Äôs debt by $600 Million dollars as the credit investor opted to take common equity instead. This reduced AMC‚Äôs debt burden and in turn has allowed them to look more favorable in the eyes of the credit market. The reduction in debt also helps AMC navigate the challenging operating environment that has been brought about by the pandemic and the restrictions. Two weeks ago, AMC was also able to raise $917 Million by tapping debt and equity markets which helped stave off concerns of bankruptcy.   I suspect that $GME will conduct an equity offering in hopes of raising cash to pay down debt.   These developments have been extremely beneficial to both $AMC and $GME and may have prevented bankruptcy of both businesses. At the end of the day I don‚Äôt want to see either business go under because of the compounding effects it has on the livelihoods of employees, the real estate market, and general blight on communities if in fact their brick and mortar spaces became vacant.     Employees:     $GME has 14,000 full time and 42,000 part time employees (as of 2019).  $AMC has 4,408 full time and 36,000 part time employees (as of 2018).  The survival of these companies mean that these people still have a livelihood and this avoids adding more to the already substantially high unemployment numbers nationally.     Real Estate:    $GME has 5,509 brick and mortar locations.  $AMC has 1,004 brick and mortar locations.  The survival of these companies mean that real estate companies avoid large vacancies and communities avoid blighted zones of lost business.  The events of the past few weeks have been the lifeline that was needed and I hope these businesses can be turned around. Godspeed.
I‚Äôm the guy who could have pulled for 113k last week, if I can hold so can you ü§≤üèª

Due Diligence - My Resons for Going Long in Blackberry
I know that last week was a bit on the turbulent side for BB. I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.  Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.  Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that   this is in no way financal advice  , neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.    THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY    For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).  In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.  However,   not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack  .    BLACKBERRY QNX    Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.  Read more about QNX  .    PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA    Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.  NIO has a market cap of   $  bn  , XPENG has a market cap of   $  bn  , Baidu has a market cap of   $80,16  , and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping   $114,7 bn  .  Why is this good for Blackberry?  1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be  "powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng"  using... you guessed it!   QNX!   2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that  "Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology"  using... you guessed it!   QNX!   3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand "Hycan", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.  Read more  .    PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON    As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered with¬†Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.  AWS launched its IoT platform in¬†2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.  By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits,¬† advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.  This reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.    PROJECT KUIPER    I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.  From Wikipedia:    Kuiper Systems LLC   is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name "  Project Kuiper  ". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.  How could BB fit into this thing?  Well, here's my hypothesis:  Why would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?  Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way "out there". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  TL;DR:    BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.   BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper

This girl ain't fucking leaving!!!!!!!!        I LIKE THE STOCK
I'm New, Were In This Together. Bought A Little Bit Today 523 Shares $AMC. AH Price Is Manipulated Don't Worry, They Are Trying So Hard.
How Did You Think This Was Going to End?
Every single parabolic move (except TSLA so far, shout out Elon) has ended the same way: exponential up, exponential down. You philosophy guys may have heard of Occam‚Äôs Razor: The simplest explanation is usually correct.   GameStop had one of the craziest rallies of all time, $  last summer to $500. The popular opinion is ‚Äúhedge funds manipulating the price down‚Äù right? Well GameStop is down 65% from the peak last week, and a lot of you will baghold to the ground. Here‚Äôs the simplest explanation: Initial short squeeze blew up several funds (RIP Melvin), guys who got in early used the hype as an exit opportunity, new shorts entered near the peak, and the 5 million new kids here listened to Dave Portnoy and bought the top bc diamond handz.   It‚Äôs not manipulation when a stock that ran up 2000% in a week pulls back, it‚Äôs mean reversion. The manipulation was what we did pushing it all the way to $500 and wrecking shop on the way.   ‚ÄúBut the VW chart from 09!‚Äù This isn‚Äôt VW. Porsche cornered VW shares by itself and refused to sell. They controlled that squeeze single handedly. There have been 100M shares trading daily, you really think everyone here is actually holding? If they were the price never would have dropped back below $400. Smart money took profits and everyone else is holding out of hope. Hopium is a dangerous drug.  How did you think this would end? Obviously profit taking would come eventually, and it looks like it hit at $500. Posting a screenshot of your 5 shares and a   üèº meme won‚Äôt hold the price up forever. The real winners got in early and took profits as the media caught on.  This is the stock market. You come here to make money. You buy low and sell high. If you refused to sell bc you believed the hype, that‚Äôs on you and you alone. You can sell at anytime, so don‚Äôt blame others for your losses.  RIP the guy who YOLO‚Äôd at $300 today, may as well have set that money on fire. I don‚Äôt like seeing losses, I want everyone to win. But when you refuse to take profits or acknowledge a potential top, it‚Äôs on you 100% to eat the losses.  The same guys crying market manipulation now were buying SPY puts out of spite in March. Could GME have gone up more? Sure. Would SPY have crashed more without JPow in March? Probably? But guess what? What ifs don‚Äôt matter in the stock market. You trade what happens.  For the new guys here, remember this lesson next time you chase a name you read online. Diamond Hands are for losers. Take profits and compound.
+$500k in this morning, on $  existing balance. Down -50% today. Never flinched, but had a sandwich.   Not panic selling during the dip is as important as not relief selling once it bounces!
It's not about the money.
I see you paper handed fucks sitting there debating whether or not you should pull out. I see you so-called "diamond handed" fucks having your hands actively decay to regular stable carbon at rates previously deemed impossible by the laws of physics.  But you know what, this is not about the money. It's about where your values are.  Do you believe that we should have a fair financial system that should benefit everybody and not just the rich? Then hold.  Do you believe that market maker shouldn't be able to blatantly cheat and collude with the media? Then hold.  Do you believe that you believe in a just world and want to put your money where your mouth is? Then fucking hold.  We are at the precipitous of fundamentally changing how the finance system works. At the edge of rooting out the corrupt fucks that got bailed out while our parents lost their homes and jobs. This isn't about the money. It's about standing for what is just.  Diamond. Mother.

What‚Äôs happening to GME?
Credit to: u/that-possible-2402  What‚Äôs Happened the Past Few Days?: The Anatomy of a Short Ladder Attack  Published courtesy of Citizens for Securities Reform, at    Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.  When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.   Typical tactics include the following:  Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.  The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.  By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of "strategic fails-to-deliver" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will "mask" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.  Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to s  the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other "success" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.  Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.   Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called "crashing" the stock and a successful "crash" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash "stick" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:  Media Assault -  The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.  The shorts have "friendly" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the "friendly" reporters worked for The  , an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.  One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's  by a factor of one million times. This "mistake" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation "Due to a mathematical error" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.  Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The  , best described the media function:  When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.  This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The   have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.   Analyst Reports -  Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned "friendly" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.  Planting moles in target companies -  The shorts plant "moles" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.  Frivolous SEC investigations -  The shorts "leak" tips to the SEC about "corporate malfeasance" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed "confidential inquiry" is leaked to the short media.  The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.  Class Action lawsuits -  Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.  Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -  If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.   Pulling margin from long customers -  The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on Pulling Margin).  Paid bashers -  The shorts will hire paid bashers who "invade" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).  This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.  How Pervasive Is This?  At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.  The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.  The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope
I'm not scared. Me brave üêí.
ASK ME IF I'M HOLDING
Why are they so alike I wonder...
I'm small, new, and     until it's through
A year‚Äôs earnings? Not even fazed
I know everyone is feeling down about the red, but please listen to this example. This is the Prisoner's Dilemma.
Remember in The Dark Knight when the joker rigs up the two ferries with explosives and gives the ferries the detonator to blow up the other boat? Each of you has been given the detonator to other people's money. If you press it, you'll take your reduced gains/losses, but you'll be taking that from another retard, not the hedge funds.  That's where I'm noticing people are at right now. I've been tracking emotional sentiment across many spam channels and communities, and from what I've seen, traction is slowing down and the big question "Do we sell and take our loss?" is coming up. I guarantee there are a lot of people who would stand in solidarity and/or lie just to keep the mob going. That's how Prisoner's Dilemma works. MANY of you are still diamond hands and I commend your valor, but we need to rally the soldiers who don't have that kind of gumption. We need to stand united. Praise u/deepfuckingvalue for staying in the trade fully.  # Most Important Part is this paragraph:  Let me explain the Prisoner's Dilemma: 3 people are arrested. Those 3 people are then questioned individually, but the cops have nothing on them so if they can't get a confession, they all walk free. To try and intimidate them, they tell them if they rat out their friends, they can walk free, but if their friend rats them out first, they won't get that deal. "Do you really trust your friend not to rat you out?" All it takes is solidarity and all 3 walk away and win. But, if one person breaks and rats them out for selfish gains, then the whole thing breaks down.  You and I, and everyone, all knew coming into this it was a boom or bust trade. The noobies expected immediate returns and are the ones risking the integrity of this play. But we can still prevail. We just have to not rat out our fellow autists to the hedge funds.  If you overextended yourself and are about to lose your rent money, we understand. We'll buy your shares back. But, remember, we always knew this could zero out and it's important to show your solidarity, because without it, this is over.  We know the hedge funds are cheating, manipulating media, acting corruptly, and showing their true colors. That means we are winning. They wouldn't need these tactics otherwise. They had the whole weekend to come up with a new strategy to dwindle our resolve and to be honest, I can see that it's having an effect on some of you. We just got mortared something fierce and we're stuck in the trenches with our ears ringing. That doesn't mean the battle is lost.  Rest assured that the majority of us are NOT selling and if you are in, all you have to do is   hold.    This is a test of human nature. Will you be selfless or selfish? Will you trust in your fellow retard or turncoat and run away? Now you show your true nature.  GIVE THEM NOTHING, BUT TAKE FROM THEM, EVERYTHING.  Forgot to say this is not financial advice. I just like the stock :).  Edit: Added this supply/demand chart from u/Davscozal:  , but it did anyway.  Edit2: u/DivySuresh made the excellent point of saying    >The last one to cover on the HF side is going to pay the most. So they're facing the same Game Theory problem we are.    We have to reach their breaking point before they reach ours. "We can remain retarded longer than they can stay solvent." Never forget.
MY FIRST LOSS PORN  ‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING LEAVING
Ultimate XL DD
Alright autists, put down your pitchforks and stop raging at Robinhood and read about the next moonshot for 5 min...  TLDR for you retards who don‚Äôt have the patience and/or the ability to read is located at the bottom.    Summary       XL fleet is a company primarily involved with the electrification of commercial fleet vehicles across the US.  This company aims to reduce carbon emissions by vehicles by fitting vehicles with electric components to transform gas powered vehicles into hybrids.    The players      Tod Hynes- The founder and president of XL Fleet who currently is a senior professor at MIT, where he lectures a graduate course, Energy Ventures. He also co-founded the MIT Clean Energy Prize.  Dimitri Kazarinoff- Current CEO of XL fleet. He is an accomplished transportation industry executive who has led impressive growth, expansion and innovation throughout his career. Prior to joining XL as CEO, Dimitri successfully scaled the hybrid power systems division of Eaton Corporation by 15x within two years.  He also has worked at General Motors.  Needless to say, the current leadership of XL fleet has decades of experience not only in Clean Energy, but also in leadership and expansion.    Application      The Implementation of electric components to vehicles is no doubt extremely beneficial to both the customer and the environment. Here‚Äôs how:  - XL‚Äôs hybrid electric  drive system improves vehicle MPG by up to 25% and reduces CO2 emissions by up to 20% for Class 2-6 fleets.  - Their Plug-In drive system improved vehicle MPG by up to 50% and reduces CO2 emissions by 33% in Ford F-150 and F-250 pickup trucks.  - XL grid is XL‚Äôs charging and power stations, and simultaneously function as driving data site analysis and solar power sites.   These figures are pretty impressive, and saving the consumer money via gasoline consumption and saving the environment via reduced CO2 emissions is a win-win.     Other Info      - On Jan 21, 2021 XL fleet was named one of the Top 100 Impact Companies by Real Leaders Magazine  - Partners with GM and Ford, along with other well-established and successful companies such as Coca-Cola.   - The US government will replace its entire fleet of 645,000 cars and trucks with US-made electric vehicles, president Joe Biden said on Jan. 25, while signing a ‚ÄúBuy America‚Äù executive order that creates new guidelines for the government‚Äôs $600 billion in annual spending on goods and services.  XL fleet can capitalize on this opportunity to further expand their operations and boost their publicity    - This stock is currently over 70% shorted with a low float (~8,000,000). Now this is not the next GME by any means, but I believe that the foundation that this company has and the fact that the Biden Administration is focusing so heavily on EV will drive this stock upward quickly.       TLDR    XL fleet is poised to rocket to the stratosphere based on its foundation, application under the Biden administration, and its partnerships (All mentioned above).  Couple this with its low float and high short percentage (70%+) and we‚Äôve got ourselves an early boarding pass to Alpha  Centauri.   Alright retards, resume brandishing those pitchforks and rage on against Robinhood, Citadel, Melvin, and üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç  , but do so with XL fleet in mind.    Giraffe out.  Positions- 200 shares and several 8/20 25c    Sources

Think logically about silver (not a bot 420 69 heehee)
Okay guys, there's been a lot of talk here about silver being fake news to pull the momentum away from $GME. I am in no way trying to say that you guys are wrong, or that $GME is the way, I'm just an idiot with a perspective.   But hear me out.   If the media posts about WSB being in silver trying to pull a gamestop, but WSB says that they're not in silver and that it's fake news, why did the price go up today? The answer seems pretty straightforward. You guys rocked the world with $GME and the rest of the world is hungry for some action. If WSB didn't push silver up today, it must have been all of the average people watching the news that missed $GME and want to catch the next wave. Why would this buying stop?   I can't imagine a single scenario where silver doesn't go up. It's just a matter of time.  $GME is headed to the moon, no doubt. But so is silver. And it's happening regardless of how you feel about it.
HOLD GUYS DIAMOND HANDS
The secret about GME the big boys don't want you to know.....
My fellow Apes:  What happens when your order goes through and you get your shares? The broker/market maker needs to offset that position to ensure liquidity in the market. So what do they do? They buy the opposite direction - a "hedge"  What does this mean with GME right now? Well, all the share are gone, this is quite well known. So, while we are buying calls and shares into the dips, it's enabling the sale of shorts and buying of puts to hedge the positions. But what if......  You begin to buy LONG DATED AT OR IN THE MONEY put options? Well, the market makers have to hedge against that   buying shares. They have to have the shares for you to sell to the other side of those contracts. Shares that don't exist anywhere because they're all being held by us. Why long-dated? Because if they think the option contracts won't be in the money in time they just ignore them, but long dated contracts carry more time risk so they hedge them.  Right now we are fighting a battle by using strength against strength, but if we use their own strength against   are fucked.  TDLR: Hold your GME shares and long dated calls. Buy long dated puts and force the market makers to squeeze themselves.
YES, I AM SCARED, SO GIVE ME SOME HOPE, HOLDING HOLDING HOLDING
I'm so scared. Very, very scared üò®
Listen retards... this is what they want you to feel.  You should sell now!   Fuck that shit with your wife's boyfriends dick.  This is not the end. Actually it's far from it. Don't let the hedge fund cocks scare you.  We survive as a group of retards looking for our zipper to take our pathetic cocks out. Once out we swing it around like a retarded helicopter.   We knew this would happen. Fuck, we told everyone this would happen. We are grabbing them by the pussy and not apologizing.   If you're wondering if you should sell instead of buying more at a delicious discount well I have something to tell you. Congratulations! You're not retarded and you don't belong here.   As for the  ü§≤... we know. The moon is only the beginning!  üî• üî•  ü§≤ ü§≤
Emotional involvement has never been this high, please understand the risk involved.
taken from r/investing, full credit to OP u/MasterCookSwag. wanted to post it here because i love this subreddit, and i think some of y'all need to read this.      First of all, I can't wait to be berated in the comments.  I'm gonna be blunt, I have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week. A lot more than normal. And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here. So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose. Short, long, whatever. It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife. Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money.  And a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.  To the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation. I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else. What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.  So let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath. It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance. It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing  :  >Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in   stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect‚ÄîI certainly expected‚Äîto see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.   >   >But here‚Äôs what Citadel Securities‚Äô retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1   >   >    >   >Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About   of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and   were to sell.   >   >What do you make of that? One reading would be: ‚ÄúRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they‚Äôre not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.‚Äù Or as one Twitter user put it, ‚Äúpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.‚Äù  So, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.    Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover  .   You, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened. You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices. You simply don't know. You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  This thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks. You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it. Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    Emotions   The problem with this whole "strike back at wall street" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade. Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt. This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars. So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending.  Want to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet. But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.  TLDR:  1. know and understand who is playing this game. And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not. You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. 2. Short squeezes end fast. As fast as they started. If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it. 3. Get your emotions out of play here. This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes. Can't handle that? then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  Lastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole "fight the hedge funds" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back. If that's worth it to you then have at it. But don't fool yourself in to thinking otherwise.
Hold‚Äôn GME like James from ‚ÄòThe Expanse‚Äô!!Don‚Äôt let tha FUD shift ya‚Äôs to metals and other targets ..  . This belta is in for the         and I like this stonk.

Why Things Are Still Looking Good: FUTURE CATALYSTS AND OUTLOOK
Let's be real, some of you are sounding like desperate fucks. You don't need to convince anybody to hold their shares; have confidence and hold strong, here is why:  Today we shook all of the paper hands. I repeat: TODAY WE SHOOK ALL OF THE PAPER HANDS. Every single mf holding the stock has    diamond      hands and will not sell.   DFV is still in  , I'm still in, we are STILL IN. We have created a moat.  Potential upcoming catalysts:    Potential announcements from gamestop regarding their outlook and business plans   More celebrity shoutouts and support by the day.   ITM calls from friday must be settled tomorrow at the latest   Legal developments (ie SEC involvement, congressional hearings)   More people realizing silver is a fucking scam.   WSB subscribers up to 8 million (was 6-7 million last week) and continuing to rise this week.   Official/reliable government short data released feb 9 or something       Addressing doubts:      According to some sources, the short percentage has dropped:  We don't know the actual short percentage. All numbers we have are estimates, which can easily be manipulated by shorters with various tactics (using options, etc) or methodology changes (not accounting synthetic longs, etc). Even if we do accept the data from S3, the short squeeze thesis is not contested or done-- as long as people hold the shorts still lose money whether they have an absurdly pants-on-fire high amount, or a lower but still insanely high amount. The true "float" of shares gets lower and lower as more and more diamond hands enter at dips. It is even possible to short squeeze at 10% (and lower) if nobody sells and buying   up due to some catalysts. Keep in mind they could add more shorts today or at any time if they believe we are losing momentum.       What if the whales rug pull us? (or some shady under-the-table deal, etc)     The whales want to make money too, and they make the most money off of volatility and GME staying high and popular. They have the retail data, they read wsb. They know you fucks ain't selling. If they wanted us to tank the price would already be 40. They would never let short sellers off the hoo knowing they could squeeze them dry.       What if shorts never give up and continue to lower the price?  I don't know about you but I believe in the stubbornness of our community of apes (which lose nothing from holding) more than hedge funds which are losing money daily. They don't want to tie up capital on losing trades for such an extended period of time.       "Veterans" and people with "concerns"  Likely holding puts or have no better idea wtf is happening than you do. What do they hope they accomplish with these "concerns"? Are they helping you by trying to spark a panic sell?     Welcome people's doubts with open arms and offer your rebuttals: our community has a diamond will.  These are just my dumb thoughts, godspeed apes.     TLDR: GME GO UP
It needs to be said louder and more often. WE ARE KILLING IT.
I know everyone is a bit shaken by today, and I‚Äôve seen many people complaining that there must be some paper handers amongst us. But if you look at the evidence, THAT ISNT A PROBLEM.   WE ARE ACTUALLY FUCKING CRUSHING IT.  It‚Äôs genuinely incredible. And it deserves to be said. It is  astounding  the uniform resolve people are showing right now.  The price action today is complete bullshit, short ladder attacks mostly. And we are getting to the end of their bag of tricks.   I‚Äôm not even worried anymore, and I almost never trust crowds. But when you look at the volume you see that we are overwhelmingly DIAMOND HANDED MOTHERFUCKERS.  Y‚Äôall have amazed and inspired me. I am going to sleep well.   And when the hedge funds inevitably break because they basically have to, I am excited to have a beer on Mars with some of y‚Äôall.  Cheers to becoming astronauts together.

IS $AG THE NEW $GME OR IS THIS PLAIN MANIPULATION?
Many of us retards are holding $GME, I personally believe and I want to hold this stock as much as I possibly can. But the charts and the numbers are clear, today $GME was down -42% while $AG soared +22%.  The real question here.. is it time to get into the $AG train before it's too late? I am going to hold my humble 10 stocks of $GME as much as I can, but I'm really concerned.  Can someone bring a real explanation of what's going on? Why is $AG +22% today?
Thought Experiment GME
Mass media is reporting the shorts have covered. Misinformation is  . In my mind, wouldn't this be the perfect time to have the Game Stop Board of Directors call for some sort of vote and in turn force a recall of outstanding shares? If there hasn't been any naked short selling going on or illegal short ladder attacks Melvin Capital shouldn't have a problem with this, after all they've told us they closed out their short positions. But what do I know?
STILL HOLDING - They tried hard today, morons
Market Simulator 2021 : Win the game with our weapon of choice.
###  $GME FAR ITM WEEKLY OPTIONS  ###    ‚ú®    Disclaimer :  Europoor reporting for duty. Am french retard √©, can't even speak proper english, i'm just a simpleton having wet dreams of retiring early. The following is a chaotic series of bad metaphors because I like images, that's what I do.  Mods : Second time trying to post this, i'm a Reddit veteran with a 9 years account. Mostly a lurker but I want to help with this new found wrinkle on my smooth brain. This is not a financial advice, do your own DD and know your risk tolerance, especially in these wild times.   Before reading my take on the subject,         STATUS QUO       In a game of musical chairs slowing down because of a drying liquidity, both parties may be stuck for a while in an inconfortable position. Shorts are experiencing a slow burn paying interests for their borrowed shares and Longs might feel discouraged with a sense of injustice turning odds against them (especially retail investors). The problem is, paid interests are marginal (millions) when that could be much much worse with an ever increasing percentage of longs which has been quite halted since last Thursday. Shorts are then playing against the clock hoping for some backup by the SEC simply freezing the trade of $GME for ten days or more, killing momentum and scaring people away --> papers hands flying in the eye of the storm.   What can we do other than buying more shares and holding? Most of us are out of ammo and holding has its limitations too. We've gone a long way, me might have already landed in the moon unknowingly but I know we all aim for more. But lets be realistic for a second, we've just invaded Dirty Money People playground and they know every corner of it. We may be in a strong position regarding $GME, but we don't drive the narrative for the remaining   of the stock market. Shorts still can make big bucks elsewhere, even though they have to liquidate their assets to fund our Nintendos, Teslas, dildo shaped rockets to effing Mars, etc.   SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Yes we already know. SHORTED SHARES DON'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. Ok we know that too, they  only  have interests to pay.       NOT JET FUEL BUT OUT OF THIS WORLD NUCLEAR BLAST TYPE FUEL       What do we do to   FORCE   them to buy those shares NEXT WEEK? What has always been our weapon of choice? Last week we were too much focused on owning our shares and holding that we collectively agreed that options were not the best way to trigger the MOASS. The plan was followed religiously and that's still an advantage.       What my only wrinkle whispered to me while in bed this morning      ‚†Ä As you retards already now, ITM options can be exercised for shares : 100xcontracts you own. Meaning, past the expiration date, those shares HAVE TO be bought within the following week and given to you lucky retards. Unfortunately, right now, one single of those safe contract cost so much that most of us can't afford it anymore.  Wrote this half assed DD this morning and it seems like options buying has been made difficult in several brokerages, meaning they don't want us to go this way...   NOW we need bigger fishes to light a fire so hot Shorts would not have time to lose their shirts but cook instantly! We need rich kids and mad billionaires!  IF we collectively hold and harden our diamonds hands even more in this week to come, and have rich troopers coming to buy every single deep ITM and ITM calls there is, next week is going to trigger the biggest chain reaction and propel us so fast that we could attain light speed in a snap and reach $69,  ‚òÆÔ∏è       PAPA MUSK, if you are reading this poorly made DD, don't buy shares, buy far ITM options to force their hands and make us   as rich as you!! I'll definitely buy a Tesla if it goes higher than $6000       Thanks for your consideration. I don't know what I've just wrote down. I'm ape. I like bananas and I like $GME for sure.     POSITIONS : 175 shares @ $65 av     PS : I love you all fucking degenerates!

BTMFD
I know a big drop is scary. Robingay cut off the main source of buying power hence the drop. I think this is a terrific price to load up more shares. I just bought 200 more shares in the 90s. When the rest of us find a new broker or when fucking Robingay can put the new billions fundings for clearing house deposits and allows unrestricted trading again. GME will easily go up to $200 (double your money from this price)  Not a financial advice but BTMFD.
Am I doing this right?
Anyone paying attention to $FIZZ (LaCroix parent company)? 83% short interest
Edited to add screenshot of positions, sorry.  Not many here seems to have noticed $FIZZ, which I believe is second to $GME in % of float shorted at 83% (  shares shorted and   float) as shown in the below image.     It hasn't gone as crazy or gotten as much hype as some of the other recent "short squeezes". Volume is typically very low, making it hard for shorts to cover without big price swings. Last week moved almost 100% on total of like 12M volume, but has come most of the way back down on hardly any volume (  Friday when the price started to drop and   total yesterday). It's down 10% today on only 150,000 shares traded, so it has massive     üåïüåïüåïüåï potential if people start to notice it more.  I posted about it a couple of weeks ago, but $FIZZ is also just generally a good company:    Known brand (parent company of LaCroix)   Highly profitable   Upside potential (CBD-infused and/or "hard" drinks)   $6/share special dividend  Here are my posts from a couple weeks ago with more details.

Volume chart patterns
Hello fellow apes. First post here.   Listen up, I want to talk about the volume charts on GME along with everything we‚Äôre seeing right now to help you make the decision to be a    chad or paper handed b   .   My thesis: GME to the moon, and the negative price movement we‚Äôre seeing right now is a non-fucking-issue.   Some facts: -RH restricted trading for GME past few days pushing price down synthetically  -silver bots spamming WSB -simultaneous coordinated media attacks to control the narrative telling us that retail has pivoted to silver -Melvin down >50% in JANUARY (oops) -S3 data looks fishy   So back to the volume charts. ‚ÄúOh shit GME is down‚Äù whatever, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confident that this is purposeful, possibly short ladder attacks.   At open 1/28, 2/1 and 2/2 MASSIVE volume for those days both at open pushing the price down, which was followed by low volume.   My interpretation: HFs trying to dispel hype and our faith by large volume selling at open (look at counterfeit stocks, can‚Äôt find link) to depress price and kill momentum.   Not financial advice, just my interpretation and why I‚Äôm down 50% but don‚Äôt fucking care.     EDIT: Volume is WAY up since I originally posted, interpret that as you will.

Cutting Through FUD
Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,  First ‚Äì Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon    This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked.      TLDR  : My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security.   They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.   No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.  My opinion is that Shorts don‚Äôt plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don‚Äôt have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a   threshold security   (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches   13 consecutive business days  . ‚ÄúParticipants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‚Äòthreshold securities‚Äô if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.‚Äù \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)    If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.    We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING!  Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.  \ Read below here if you can or care.  1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?  Shorts weren‚Äôt required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn‚Äôt good for them, but it isn‚Äôt as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here    It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).  So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.  2. How does that help the shorts?  Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.  Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.  3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?  I don‚Äôt think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.  4. We‚Äôve heard this before. So what?  I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don‚Äôt think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker    Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don‚Äôt count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.    Threshold Securities    Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for  ¬∑ Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and  ¬∑ Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and  ¬∑ Equal to at least   of the issuer‚Äôs total shares outstanding.  If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.  Conclusion: Hold banana with diamond hands to board the rocket ship  Relevant links  SEC -    See rule 204 ‚ÄúClosing-out Requirements‚Äù        Edit: 'We must hang together or surely we shall all hang separately.' - maybe some smooth brain that has his face on money

For those still in doubt about the short ladder attacks
This link has been posted a lot but i still feel like people need to pay more attention to it. Just look you fucking retards:      Look at the recent trades , when was the last time you bought or sold a stock with fucking 4 decimal points? Thats what a short ladder attack looks like , pay attention to the volume too and dont worry about the value right now , it is FAKE it is literally made by fucking robots trading back and forth like two retarded AIs playing tennis with our balls.   Keep holding(if you like the stock of course , this is not financial advice) and they ll eventually run out of ammo. Remember that this sinking pit in your stomach and the liquid shits youve been having is exactly what the hedgies want you to feel , this is psychological warfare at its best.  tldr: ü§ñüìâüö´ and üêµ  =üí∞

GME tendies in both directions
BUY AND HOLD = DON'T SELL DON'T LOSE $GME $AMC
This is not advice, I just love these stocks!   If you don't sell, the price won't go down. Buy and hold on mass can make everyone, especially the initial investors very rich. It is the basis for the recent gains in tech. The public sentiment is creating value in many of these companies. Just look at ZM. It's a direct consequence of democratized trading and it will become more and more influential.    Everyone has the misconception that a stock's price is determined by some true value+potential of the company. In fact, the potential of a company is actually in part a function of stock price. This means that a large group of buyers of the stock can directly fund as well as motivate managers and CEOs to stay interested in building a successful company. I'm sure the new management doesn't want to squander our support. The price is a barometer of public reputation which is a strong indicator of longevity. That's what the market wants most in the end.   Democratizing trading will allow publicly popular companies to redeem themselves financially. In a sense, it is a safety net of public faith. If gamestop management can capitalize on our support, the is real potential it can turn itself around. I spoke to a relative of mine who was a former manager at a gamestop who said that the new management dreams of turning stores into social hubs like Starbuck's. By cultivating a friendly environment for gamers, they can capitalize on an open market. This will be especially successful if a roaring 20s type decade unfolds (assuming the vaccine is successful in stopping the virus, which it is poised to do so far according to researchers like Nicholas Christakis at Yale).  This would ensure gamestop becomes a physical environment of the gaming community for the foreseeable future, occupying a niche I think no other company is better positioned to seize.    I say let's fund that dream and reap the spoils.   93 shares gme and $450 $570 calls 02/05, 400 shares AMC and 5 $40 02/05 calls

Just got my first share of GME in fidelity.
At first I did not have enough in my account for GME so I picked up some AMC and NOK because they were cheaper... only one of each.   Then I couldn‚Äôt even buy fractions of shares on Robinhood. I started the transfer of stocks from Robinhood to fidelity and started the transfer from my bank to the account, and today I was able to pick up my first of GME.   I never plan on selling, on Friday (pay day) I plan to buy more.   I‚Äôm on the rocket no matter if it blows up or goes to the moon!

$GME, STILL HOLDING
My fellow autists,  Once again the world has sought to divide us. Yesterday it was with silver and short ladder attacks. Last week, with brokerages. Before that, politics, race, Android and Apple, football and football, smooth brain and smoother brain. This narrative has dragged on for as long as I can remember.   The hedge fund managers and corporate backers and media pundits who've pushed us towards failure for decades are the same who seek our failure today. To them, we're no different than the commodities and securities they so freely and fragrantly manipulate. At our expense they use our diamond hands, gorilla strength, and full tilt retardation against us, and the truth is that until now we've drooled idly by and let it happen. We let them overshort us to the brink of moral bankruptcy, economic collapse, and cultural disaster, while they sat back and stuffed their pockets with our tendies.   Until $GME.  We, in all of our smooth brained glory, came together in the name of a hopeless cause because we believed we had the power to change it for the better. We set aside our differences and agreed that despite them, we found something worth fighting for. Today we stood shoulder to shoulder with the great apes of old. We fervently beat our chests with diamond hands and shouted "HOLD" as we stared down our oppressors. Some paper hands fled in the face of this tyranny, but we HELD! In glorious revolution we lit our forges and fired that paper into endless diamonds.  Now, on the frontline of yet another bloody battlefield, we find ourselves strapped onto the backs of rockets. Ready to launch ourselves into the heavens if only to add more stars to the night sky for those below us. We do not fear death, for what's $323 worth when priced against the soul of our people? Take in the enemies terror. Look them in the eyes as we take to the stars my friends, for they'll speak of us generations from now.  Apes bring hope. Diamond hands no drive good, rockets only go up. We go too?  Make no mistake, we are here fighting for so much more than $GME, but it is absolutely $GME that we're fighting for. Believe in us. Believe in yourself. Believe in a better world for all smooth brains where the bulls  t the elites pull on us and call "protection" is brought to the dirt and burned off in the glow of our afterburners.  With hands like diamonds we sail into the tides of eternity, Monkeys amongst the stars.   WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Robinhood alternative that doesn't suck dingleberries
During the chaos of the last few days many of us tards have been left wondering where to move instead of Robinhood.  Robinhood can suck my unwashed taint, but where can I find an app that still makes my 3 brain wrinkles tingle and doesn't have a UI that looks like a hospital intranet from 1995 (sorry Fidelity but your platform is a massive piece of shit).  The answer I just found is Public. It has a nice UI that's easy to understand like Robinhood, but instead of cutting off its basic services when the going gets tough they actually pushed back on the powers at be to keep unrestricted access to our precious GME and its associates during last week's shitstorm.  So is this an advertisement for Public? Yeah I guess so. I'm not going to plug a ref link in here because I'm not an autistic garbage boy, but I will say that it's pretty dope.    HUGE ADDED PLUS    There's a social aspect to it where you can comment on trades and see what people are doing. This is most important because   you can see when people paper hand and see how much they lost  .     So they've got a built in gain/loss porn feature which is hype because that's basically what we're all about here.  TL;DR  There's a Robinhood adjacent app with a built in gain/loss porn feature called Public and it isn't one of the dinosaur platforms with a UI that looks like a 1990's book store website. Also you can buy as much GME as you want while you laugh at the people losing 70%+ after holding for 2 days.  Positions: All in GME
GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next
Hello all,  (written Monday so "tomorrow" = Tuesday 2nd")  If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD  .  Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.  Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.  But what's interesting to examine   did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.  Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.  One of two things can happen to these people:  1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able 2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.  This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.  So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.  Now, why would they do this?   This is a very interesting question.    If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?  Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple   this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.  If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.  Another question to consider:  If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.  The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go   Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.  Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually   so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but   would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.  Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:  1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption. 2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.    TL;DR:   If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go   it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.  I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.  Copied off a greaT DD    EDIT:   For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.    EDIT2:   This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one. We just do our best to guess.

$FUBO DD - Connecting the dots, this thing is going to be a MONSTER.
From u/heardme  Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.  First, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly.   Q3 Results:      Revenues were $  million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:         Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $  million.      Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $  million.   Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.   Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $ , up 14% year-over-year.   Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to   million hours.   Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.  Q4 Preliminary Results:       Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\  Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.   Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.  It smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal.    FUBO  is estimated to announce  earnings  between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021     Most of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet.   As mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:  \- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.  \- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)  \- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)  Fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent.         Now, on to the NBA:     "Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV‚Äôs formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world ‚Äì Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney."  David Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.  Why am I bringing up the NBA?     People are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform.   The NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)        Now, lets look into two key acquisitions:   \- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech.   Balto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.     Fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts    34m shares short,   of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now.   Since the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60.   Short term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.  Long term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.     TL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February). We got massive revenue growth, we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports, we have the NBA basically saying they're in as long as Fubo can execute.

IG openly admitting they're limiting purchases! GIVE ME GME OR GIVE ME DEATH!
GME Devils Advocate
I think most people can agree that based on fundamentals(what is that), GME is way over valued. So if I were a hedge fund now that the crash has started this seems like a guaranteed profit if I shorted it.  What does this mean? If short interest really did drop(no one really believes that right?) then new shorts are being opened, especially if they think they can drive the price down using ladders and other manipulation. If you continue to hold there can be a short squeeze, maybe a second stage booster if you will. The new shorts instead of being in at $20 are now in at $110. This means they will probably hold longer until they cover. Could easily go back up, not just to the moon but Mars or Pluto or another Galaxy.   I am no expert and this is pure speculation but
Buy buy buy while it‚Äôs not too late üèª   GME will go up
THIS IS AMERICA

Hold lads, GME will remember us, we will not be forgotten

The other numbers you see are calculated through some type of algorithm but they are not declared "official"

Your favorite metric can be faked - how they fake high volumes
This is not financial advice. This is not investment insight. This is not analysis. This is the smooth-brained ramblings of a post-wisdom tooth extraction anesthesia fog.   I have enjoyed the regular glut of armchair "analysts" showing that ladder attacks and slow fades have only been low volume events, implying that hedge funds are just manipulating prices for reasons (probably psychological reasons, maybe contractual ones). Maybe even doing it with counterfeit shares.   I don't know anything about that.   But don't forget, when high volume events (like the recent drop)  do  occur, that may not necessarily imply high retail involvement.   Short ladder attacks may be able to be accomplished with low quantities of shares being traded back and forth as others have described. But there's nothing stopping hedge funds from doing the same with millions of shares, especially if counterfeit shares are actually that easy to produce and then dissolve.  I really liked the movie where that one CGI monke used American Sign Language to tell the other CGI monke that APE TOGETHER STRONG.   ü§≤   ü¶ßüêí   ü§ù   ü¶ßüêí  ü§≤  You don't need encouragement.

Inhale. Exhale. Take a chill pill.
Pls dont remove this post mods.  I feel like the reason we are losing this battle is because people are getting panicked and they are selling their shares to recover their investments. A big reason for that could be the fact that so many trading platforms are banning the trade of GME and AMC which kinda sends a bad signal to the average joe trading these shares. And not to forget about the fact that the media is portraying the WSB group as a bunch of evils. So now the next question for the average joe is what should i do? I mean people need to relax a little and swallow that chill pill.  You bought some shares on platform X and cant trade them - hold hold hold and try to find platform Y where trading is not banned. If you can, buy some on platform Y but dont sell the ones on   If we can all hold together, we can win this battle and create history.  Im 10 k deep into GME and AMC and the best thing to do atm is to relax and forget about your investment.  PS. This is not a financial advice. Ima retard who is gonna hold GME to the moon
TOGETHER  ü§ö
HOPEFULLY ITS AS TIGHT AS MY BUTTHOLE
Here's the truth
This was over the minute billionaire grifters and media got in on it. After RH got hobbled last week, that was the last nail in the coffin. It resulted in 6M people joining this subreddit that refused to listen to anything that wasn't confirmation bias. Every single post was the same "This is not advice, I'm retard [rocket]". Every DD that didn't support that narrative was considered a bot post (even though they had long post history). When people start putting up billboards, that's when you know it's squoozed.    1) The short interest is still "121%" "226%" "53% is fake!"   - the actual short interest is published 2x per month with a huge delay when between the reporting date and the publish date - this means you are always getting either stale data (like the ones referenced in media) or modeled data (Ortex, S3) - with this much volatility within a few days, there is almost no way to accurately model this  2) Shorts have to cover in   days!!!   - shorts are not options, they don't have an expiration date - shorts pay interest payments to the issuer, at an annualized rate, NOT a daily rate - this means, if the interest rate is 60% for a $300 share, the interest payment per day is only $     3) Short interest is indicator of time to squeeze!   - no, short interest does not tell you the average price it was shorted at - those that shorted < $50 likely had to cover early but they reentered short positions at the top - this means that the net short interest is the same, but the average short price increases from say $50 to $250 - as long as they have buying opportunities below the current price, they can remain short    4) The VW Squeeze!   - completely different situation where 75% of the outstanding shares were unavailable  - the squeeze wasn't triggered by retail, it was triggered by porshe's announcement - 77% of GME ownership is by institutions, they can also sell OTC to shorts    5) All the Calls are ITM, Gamma Squeeze!   - most of the calls were sold as covered calls by institutions like Blackrock Fidelity etc. that were going to make money regardless of what price they sold it at - even if some of the calls were uncovered, they likely delta hedged throughout the week, not wait until Friday afternoon to buy    6) Melvin is still in!   - Citadel and Point72 didn't hand over $  so they can lose more money, they did it with an exit plan in mind - MMs don't look at trades emotionally, they have customers to appease - trade volume was far more than they needed to exit over a period of 5-7 days, they likely also shorted more on the way up

BUYING THE DIP
GME, bargain prices
WHY GME IS DOWN
Fellow retards, bag-holders, u/Lansman grandma and paper-hands,  lets look at the facts:  1) Short % according to S3 is still at 122% (   2) Robinhood is still not allowing users to trade securities freely. These include $GME, which artificially creates selling pressure. They are currently raising money to have capital on hand, or liquidity, to allow users to freely trade all positions again. As soon as this happens $GME will  , similar to Friday.  3) All users who transferred their accounts from Robinhood to other brokerages still need time, it takes 3-5 days on average. Meaning eow the first users will be able to buy stocks freely again, those will include $GME. This will create another spike in GameStop. I heard fidelity is great, I personally use TDA & eTrade.  4) Volume is low. Meaning all the restrictions they placed on users to exclude them from free market access obviously worked, but the real diamond hands aren't selling. As soon as people realize they made a mistake, people will pile in. This will happen latest eow as brokerages allow users to trade the stocks again AND call options expire. Another spike will probably trigger HF's to finally cover their short positions again, as they currently believe they have "won" the fight and successfully diverted our attention.  5) They got you right? They destroyed your believe in the short squeeze? See how you feel? That's exactly what they wanted. Don't call the fight yet, this is round 4 of 12, we will knock them out soon. Just hold tight and buy what you can. This dip will not last long and you will bite your    ass when $GME rockets to $1000.  Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, I am retarded. $GME      Positions: GME @ average $  and $AMC Calls.

"We Can Be Retarded Longer Than You Can Stay Solvent" - Someone (Part 2)
Exercising my OTM expiring Calls
I know the usual suggestion for calls is to sell to close contracts, or to let them expire worthless, rather than exercising, but i don't think that applies in the current short market.  Right now i have contracts that expire friday, and due to short ladder attacks, have fallen well short of the breakeven.  But im considering exercising them anyway.  If the currently depressed prices are real, then nothing substantial will change after I get my 100 shares per contract.  The brokers wont need to buy more at higher prices to fill my order.  They can buy it at the price it is now and walk away with profit.  But if the prices are truly gamed, and 10k other people also just happen to have my same perspective, we will force the brokers to purchase millions of shares, that may or may not be available, at asking prices.  This either ensures we both lose on the deal, or that i win.  And i win by watching their buys drive the price back to its actual cost, while i get 100 shares to instantly be able to hold or sell immediately for the proper price on the market.  Does this sound correct to anyone else, or just me?  Im not a financial expert, just trying to ask for perspective of others who really like the stock!
This will fly to the moon fellow diamond hands

Some thoughts on SILVER, GME and game changing events with dragons and stuff
# Disclaimer:  I   am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I barely   understand how the stock market works. Professionally I'm a   computational researcher -- my job is to simulate complex systems that   my smooth brain barely understands.  Okay fellow retards,  loooong time lurker and europoor autist. So excuse my spelling. Let‚Äôs brake some things down:  SILVER:  It‚Äôs   a real well played scheme on this. You have to remember there is a   dragon in the east, where people have a historically deep bonding to   silver. And the dragon looooves to take a gamble. So, number one   priority for Melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon   from GME with shiny silver. Imagine HFs did not throatfuck GME on   Thursday and the dragon banged into the marked, heavy. This uprising of   the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late   Wednesday, early Thursday. If HFs didn‚Äôt screw the market exactly this   moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets, they   would have already been toast.  Besides   that, try to find silver shorts/put options for a reasonable   spread/price which are also available to buy. I tried the whole day   yesterday but at least at my europoor broker I couldn‚Äôt find a single   one. What tells you that? Looks like   smart money is not buying the silver rush  .     ANTI GME  BOTS:  These guys are getting their   bots more and more angry and aggressive     over the last 24h. But why would they still take the effort, if they  already hit their targets? All this shows to my retarded autist smooth   brain is that they are in deep fear! Hey, bot guys I just want to quote   one of your clients: ‚ÄúWhat's your beef with me. I'm just trying to make  a  living just like you‚Äù   hope you guys got payed in advance,  because  your clients will likely go out of business!  Anyways... just to repeat   the obvious: They try to create fear among you retards   and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper!  To   close this part I just want to quote some famous investor from Omaha:   (Be) ‚Äúfearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are   fearful.‚Äù I‚Äôm an autist, I don‚Äôt feel fearful at all. I simply can‚Äôt‚Ä¶   But for some reason the bot guys are. They seem fearful as fuck to me.     SHORT INTEREST RATIOS:  So I hope most of you guys realized, they simply changed the formula to calculate   SI rates  . It‚Äôs basically   still \~120%  .     In science you would say they normalized the standardization:  You   take your observed value also into account and add it to your base   value. Eventually your maximum number can only be <=1 or in other   terms <=100%, In this specific case you take your number of shorted   stocks and add them to the float as a base value. Then you divide your   number of shorted stocks by the base value (including shorted stocks)   which can only be smaller then 1 or 100% in respective. ...inflate the   base to make things look completely different‚Ä¶ Anyways my smooth brain   is able to convert the equation to the old standard (shorts/float) which   is based on S3s latest 55% short interest rate (Just to make it easy  for your autist brains):  shorts/(shorts   + float) =   ‚Üí   shorts = float  ->   shorts = float   ‚Üí  shorts = 1/  float =   float or 123% of float.         addition you have to keep in mind, big players always have taken fines   and trials into consideration as costs. I don‚Äôt know what the fines  for  misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are, but if you  are  scared to death you should:  First   of all, not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by   recruiting bot armies, obviously lying, silver bullshit, other FUD,     name it.  AND you are   willing to take any risk to survive.   fines     this kind of   situation probably any kind of fines no matter what.        But  why would they do this? Whats their business with the Hfs? You ask  yourself? You guys are threatening soooo many business models in   finance. And this is the real   game changer  !  Keep   in mind: On stock markets you mainly trade the future. You have to  make  scenarios for the upcoming future. And there is a horrifying  scenario  for boomer financial services arising at the horizon. But  first let‚Äôs  bring it to the crucial point first:  Look for   information asymmetries  ,   google it or whatever‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about in the end. That‚Äôs   the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small   players. It‚Äôs all about information sovereignty. Or the information   monopoly‚Ä¶ however you call it. The one who is (quicker) capable to   gather more accurate information and hide it from others, wins. Like   buying your investment decisions and order limits from RobinHood.   Sometimes it‚Äôs even enough to convince your enemy that you are in   possession of better information. (By the way, this fight about   information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now. HFs   try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate   information about the whole situation.)  So, lets come back to the bullet point:  Imagine   a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more   accurate information and take investment decisions on that. Because of   declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it.   This will drastically change the current state of the market in means of   clients to financial service provider relations. Making it a more   liberated, fairer market in some kind.   whole industry would lose   trillions in the future. So yeah, you guys did it. You scared a big   chunk of the whole financial sector.  Not with GME in particular but with this way of investing.   Therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition  process MUST be stopped and delayed at any cost. This is literally the  clusterfuck for boomer financial services! And the worldwide media and   wsb are the battlegrounds right now.        But   hey, I‚Äôm just a short minded, stock loving retard, having a lot of fun  on this! GME to the moon! Planing to buy some dips today because I‚Äôm  way  to autistic to feel anxious about ridiculous 100 stocks short  ladder  ping pong.        TL;DR: GME, trillions, to the moon!

90% OF AMERICANS STILL CAN‚ÄôT BUY GME
I want to be in the trenches so bad, just know 90% of Americans still cannot buy GME.  Where is the SEC? Where is our government? They‚Äôre bought by citadel and other hedge Funds being held hostage by the lie that a GME squeeze will take down the economy. Their strategies to counter the buy pressure was totally ineffective until they shutdown Robinhood and Webull. They‚Äôve illegally counterfeited shares and manipulated the media right in front of the public eye.   Rebellions reach a tipping point, one where they stick it out against all the odds, or fold under the pressure. You wanted to know what it was like to fight Wall Street? Now you do.   Whether we go down in history as a renaissance or a failed rebellion is up to you.    üèª
BABY APE SCARED NO LONGER. I DIDNT WORK FOR THIS MONEY SO IM NOT AFRAID TO LOSE IT ALL
Bought it at all time high and everyday is red for me, but im not taking it back. Life time profits are coming!
BUY THE DIP! I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR ONE SECOND THAT THESE GREEDY FUCKS HAVE COVERED OVER 60% OF THEIR SHORT INTEREST ON THESE LOW VOLUME DOWN DAYS BUT EVEN IF THEY DID YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING THIS MORNING IS THEM DOUBLING DOWN AND NAKED SHORT SELLING ONCE AGAIN!
If you sell today you're going to regret it for the rest of your life!   These greedy HF's can only pull so many shares out of their ass before they will be out of ammo. They're just trying to lower the price so they can:  1. Cover at the lowest price possible 2. Buy the shares they need to deliver by TODAY for all the calls that were exercised Friday at the lo 3. lowest price possible       There is no way the real short interest percentage is 53% but even if it is, THATS STILL HIGH AF!   You think these greedy HF's are just going to cover and then leave the stock alone? Right now they think they have you on the ropes so they're tripling down and shorting this shit on the way down! You know what that means? They're shorting it at $115 instead of $450 which is WAYYY more risky. It's super easy to justify $115 fundamentally for GME without even taking into consideration the squeeze.          We're in a desert right now and the HF's are dying of thirst and we have the water.   Are you going to sell it them at a loss for peanut? Fuck no! These guys have screwed us over for so long and we're going to give in and let them win? There is no way in hell that if we just hold that we don't go to the moon.          How many of the sales today will turn out to be failures to deliver?   They're literally selling fake shares right now to drive the price down and we're not going to believe their BS! They're eventually going to have to pay back these shares and we're going to make them pay OUR price for them.          Buy low, sell high!   Do you have cash in your account? Buy low? When you're buying you should probably feel a little hesitant, that's how you know you're getting a good deal! Holding shares? Don't sell! You're supposed to sell high not sell low you dumb fuck.          This will be the defining moment of this sub.   You better believe that the smart money on wall street is buying right now. Are you going to join them on this rocket ship to the moon or are you going to pussy out and step off the spacecraft right before take off?        \ I'm not a financial advisor, do your own DD\      Positions: GME Shares

FDA Approval Imminent for $BLUE
Hey All,  Following up with a 3rd DD after posting these gems last year:  . Both were excellent disasters, so sorry to the degens who followed me down those holes. Nonetheless, I doubled down on my $OZK play because I still think they're shit.   Moving on, I believe $BLUE is on the verge of FDA approval for one or both of it's key gene therapy drugs. The company currently has a beta thalassemia drug conditionally approved in the EU (Zynteglo), and has a sickle cell drug that's awaiting approval. Last year was rough for the company as it struggled to get approvals, while it continued to burn through cash on its cancer drug research.  The company will be splitting off the cancer division later this year into a separate company, so it can enable both new companies to focus better on their respective applications. As a result, $BLUE is trading below 50% of where it was a year ago, despite having two fully developed drugs in the pipeline.  On to the DD: $BLUE has just posted a role on its website for a VP of US Sales for Zynteglo and the Stem Cell drug  . These roles are expensive and hard to fill in Boston, indicating that $BLUE feels like they'll need a US sales team soon.    The Play: Jan 21 2022 Call, $85 strike. It's currently trading at $  per contract. The option will pay out a 100% gain if $BLUE increases to $90 by December '21. Considering this stock reached a high of $230/share on successful trial news, an FDA approval will send this stock soaring. Obviously there's huge risk here, but $BLUE seems to think things are looking up based on their hiring.  TLDR: $BLUE is a pharma stock trading at a discount considering FDA approval may be imminent; they just posted job openings for a US sales VP.

Tell me you are not all absolute pussies as I watch AMC plummet. No heart. No hope. Should have watched a Rocky Movie before investing your monies. üôàüôàüôà who is still in there?
Remember last time when we dipped to 120 how scared you were? Then we recovered... and you said next time it dropped this low you'd buy the dip.
Nothing's changed. When this recovers you will feel the same euphoria you felt last time it recovered. And you'll once again regret not buying the dip. Don't make the same mistake twice.  I own GME, I like the stock, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. Just a suggestion and and giving you info. It's all up to you.  These are dark times. Trust each other. Your money is more than in your own hands. This community is a brotherhood. We win and lose together. And we are powerful. I woke up today and realized; it's just money. And the fear of losing went away quickly, and I calmed down. Money is so fucking stupid when you actually think about it. We're all gonna die one day. Anyway I'm getting too philosophical lol.  Again, I'm saying it could stay like this for a while. Don't watch the stock. Set your limits and step away. This is a draining game, physically and mentally. Don't let yourself lose. Meditate, workout, read, watch TV, spend time with family, I don't care, just do anything but watch the ticker.
GMC down?!? I'm buying!
Thanks for the dip / Thanks for the trip to the Moon (insert emojis)
I‚Äôm shorting GME. Unpopular opinion: GME is going down, most of this is greed, and shorting is normal
So sure sticking it to wall street and burning shorts may be ok. Big Wall Street traders do manipulate and exploit financial instruments and stock prices.   However:  -	Most of the buying movement in GME is personal greed.  -	Shorts perform an important and healthy function in a market. If they are wrong, they provide stocks at a cheaper price for you.  -	Bankruptcy doesn‚Äôt always destroy a business if the underlying is good. Instead, it reorganizes it.  Wallstreetbets used to be about young males trying to look retarded and not taking themselves too seriously.   Now it‚Äôs actual cringe, with financially illiterate straw grasping and interpretation of anything not going your way as a literal malicious conspiracy.   The market isn‚Äôt a democracy.   I‚Äôve shorted GME and trust me, the money in shorts can crush any number of regular folk.   If I am right this post is far more beneficial than these silly fan fiction grade posts about the stock market.

ME AND MY 8 SHARES ON HOLD
Bought all I could for the Retard Army. Dip -> Buy Dip -> Buy
Not a bot.. are we fucked?? Short interest from January 15th compared to February 1st. I‚Äôm not new but a rookie so can I get an explanation? Also assuming this data is accurate which it‚Äôs hard to know for sure.
I'll take the downvotes, i don't mind, but someone has to say it
While i love that gme has brought a ton of community and united many of us to a singular cause, please be responsible. I see a lot of diamond hands chatter, but the fact is that many brothers in here stand to lose a lot of cash.  There will be other opportunities. Take a moment, reset, and wait for the next stock that "we just like". The market isn't going anywhere. The GME ride has given us a glimpse of how much power retail investors have - it's better wielded as a focused effort.
ELI5: Why can't shorts cover their positions privately with longterm holders?
Say a short seller has 5% shares outstanding, and lets say they found a long-term holder that wants to get rid of their shares and capitalize on the recent price action. Is there any possible way for the short seller and long-term holder to make some private deal to prevent the short squeeze? Say the holder sells to the short seller, and the short seller returns the stock to the original lender(s)?  I'm legit not trying to troll. 55 shares of $GME $120\~ DCA.

NOK Announces 10G rollout at 9AM. Its gonna be a hell of a ride today.
So we all know that NOK is a value play. This further puts NOK as leader in the tech right now. They already have a ton of contracts dealing with 5G. They are talking about 1T, but today announced 10G rollout as well. If that doesnt mean anything I dont know what does. The down play in the market today is because of its link in the BANG gang. Most of the other 3 have dropped, pulling it down as well. But dont let that fool you. Its a long play. IT IS IN NO WAY A SHORT PLAY... We really have to drill that into peoples heads. .... and for sake of my self.... I'm not a financial advisor... LOOK AT THE NEWS....        Edit: Clarification- 10G is a fiber rollout. Its an infrastructure update. 1T is the   Network aspect.
If you want to hurt the shorts, GME is no longer the best target
The key to hurting short sellers, and triggering a squeeze, is to turn their positions into the red. Only then will they maybe get margin called or trigger their risk protocols.  This depends crucially on the price they started shorting. For example, if a HF shorts 1000 shares of GME at $4, and it is now $100, they have $4000 cash and a short interest of $100,000, with a loss of $96,000. Meanwhile a hedge fund that shorted at $300 and the stock is now $100, is sitting on $300,000 cash, a $200,000 gain, and $100,000 short interest.  Unfortunately, according to Ihor/S3's data (giving him the benefit of the doubt), the current GME short interest is   billion on 27 million shares shorted. This means the current shorts started at $325 dollars a share. For us to meaningfully hurt their books we would have to drive the share price to like $400-$600 \ without\  a short squeeze before a short squeeze happens. That takes a lot, specifically 10s of billions of dollars, so I don't see that happening soon, even with whales etc. on our side. Sadly, the broker shenanigans seem to have given them a chance to slip out.  (GME data:    So now what? The best we can do is hold and wait for material events to happen related to the turnaround. As Ryan Cohen succeeds, we will have the winds behind our back to try this again in a few months.  In the meantime, consider these stocks instead: FUBO and BBBY. Both have decent businesses and high short interest at a reasonable price.  (short data:    FUBO is a growing streaming platform that is great for live sports. It is growing and has a lot of wall street analyst support. It is heavily shorted at 67% of float, with the shorts in at $50. Wall street analysts have also recently set 50 price target, and the stock is at 50. FUBO is thus a great candidate to paint some HF books red.  BBBY is not as good of a target, but has a credible turnaround story like GME, and is currently sitting at $26 dollars, with the shorts in at $52 according to S3. This could move with an order of magnitude less capital than GME before the shorts start seeing losses.     Happy hunting.     Positions:  Long Stock: GME, FUBO, BBBY, CCL  Long LEAPS: FUBO, BBBY, CCL  Short FD: FUBO, BNBBY, CCL
ALL THIS IS, IS A HUGE FUCKING CLEARANCE SALE STAY STRONG    We together to the moon.

30 More Shares on MARGIN!!!!! We gonnna get it!
The Hedgies did not give up and suddenly change their Hedgie ways. They are doubling up on shorts everything expecting us to fold! Buy the dips!
These HFTs do not run on emotions, they run on algorithms and statistics. If they think a price is ballooning, they WILL short it. They all doubt these prices will hold and continued. They are leveraged between each other, and strategizing amongst themselves to profit off a bubble.   Every single ‚ÄúWSB stock‚Äù has been shorted out the ass over the last week. $GME, $AMC, $BB, $  all the rest. They are moving as one   Every single dip retail traders with    are acquiring an increasing share of the float. At some point the hedge funds are all just trading borrowed shares amongst each other. The more you buy and hold, the less power they have, and the more shares they‚Äôre going to need to reacquire.    They don‚Äôt want you to know it but WSB is a powerful decentralized hedge fund. An average of 4 shares each is all it will take for this sub to become the largest controlling interest of the GME float (and the rest).  Can‚Äôt afford $GME shares? Wait for a dip or buy one of the other stocks. They‚Äôre spreading their risk over all of them.    Every time you buy the dip and hold shares they are digging themselves into a deeper hole.   Remember that short interest data you‚Äôve seen until now is total bs. The firms do not report short data for last month until tonight at 6pm, and the results won‚Äôt be made public until 2/9. S3 and the others are putting  out completely arbitrary speculations based on computer models. In reality they have no idea because the numbers haven‚Äôt been reported yet!    Buy the damn dips! Hold!  . . .  this is not financial advice I‚Äôm retarded
What does that mean?? RISE $GME
Gonna try one last time to save y'all from y'allselves
Guys - the squeeze has come and gone. This is the end game now, you all just need to bail and take what you can off the table before it goes to 10 and then to zero.      I know you don't believe data etc and your bias wants you to believe the short interest stats are all nonsense, but when all available short interest indicators have collapsed after a meteoric price rise - its over. see below.     The remaininng short interest is easy to cover, and there's no reason to believe you can squeeze it higher - your powder is probably mostly shot (seriously, how many of you have anything left in the chamber? there's $1tn of hedge fund money on the other side waiting to pound you out). this is the end. the squeeze was last week. its over. get out while you still can.
Better late than never?
The case for Lemonade (LMND)
This name has been red hot and many believe it's trading higher than it's value based on optimistic projections of growth. The app is great, easy to use and the companies commitment to giving back to charity all seem like boons for a successful company. This seems like a no-brainer for disrupting the insurance market. With all of this, I've noticed there's significant short interest in this company and it is a pretty low market cap of \~8 Billion. I like the stock and seeing headlines like this in recent weeks is juicy "Lemonade drops 11% after notorious short-seller says the stock should trade 43% below current levels"     Short Percent of Float:      I'm not a financial advisor. I don't know what I'm doing just typical reddit clown with no idea what he's talking about. Do not make decisions on investing from me. I just like the stock.
Saw That Wall Street Is Trying To Suppress GME Again, So I'm Buying Roughly $17 Million In Stock
Please. Please, unless you want to hurt your WSB teammates, don't downvote this because I'm going to spill a universal truth, as truthful as saying the sky is blue and water is wet. Please let ideas be seen and let the people decide.
MEMES ARE TEMPORARY.    Is a meme from 2007 or 2014 or even 2020 worth a damn today?  No. That's what Gamestop stock is, a meme, and it'll go away into irrelevance like all memes.  Don't invest in "Chocolate Rain" or "nyan cat" thinking they have permanent relevance. They don't. They're just memes. This was an amazing run and an amazing occurrence in history. You literally destroyed a hedge fund. But all memes pass.  I posted this this morning and had you listened then you'd be up.    You need to get out of this. It's going to the teens. Please, don't hurt yourself for a stupid meme. And before you point to DFV, HE SOLD $15 MILLION. He's not dumb. He made a fortune because his meme went viral but he's not going to be left holding the bag. Don't you be left with that either.  Right now you can get out a winner. Do that. Don't be a loser holding the bag and thinking you gained anything by that. You don't even know the people on WSB. You know your real-world friends, you know your coworkers, you know your family. You don't know the WSB people!  PLEASE. THIS IS JUST TRUTH. MEMES DIE. DONT' DIE WITH IT.

Not Surprising
It's not surprising that both $GME and $AMC are dipping so much when they have cut off the ability for common, small buy people to purchase the stocks.  Only being able to sell is scaring people and falsely pushing the market down.  Plus I'm sure none of the HF are selling off to try and make it look even worse.  HOLD!!
DONT LET OUR POSITIVITY BECOME THAT RED LINE!!
Everything we have is being taken away from us. We aren't going to let this beat us though! We need to stay positive and sing (tendie man song of course) and hold each other up. Sure, Yes, it would be great if we get money and win in the long run and personally I think we will. Obviously its the reason so much shady stuff going on, too try and limit their loses. I found out through WSB I'm retarded though so I could be wrong. THE ONE THING I KNOW IS AN ABSOLUTE IS, OUR POSITIVTY MUST NOT END UP LIKE THAT RED LINE!!!!! BE HAPPY BE POSITIVE. This is really about so much more than money now and it has opened up so many of your eyes. For newcomers to trading think about how much you have learned in the last few days! Mini stocks crash course for sure. There is definite value in that. Stay positive. Keep calm. BUY AND HOLD if you financially can and lets take this to the end together smiling! This is so big and we are doing amazing!  I LOVE YOU ALL
Holding Melvin Capital, Citadel and Robinhood accountable
I just left a complaint with the FBI. On their website it says to contact them when.    Financial crimes that involve fraud, especially corporate fraud, mortgage fraud, or other investment fraud schemes where significant dollar losses have occurred, including those impacting you or your place of work;  Seeing this has in fact been happening. You can leave a tip with the FBI about Melvin Capitals Securities Fraud scam. The exact definition of Securities Fraud is "a deceptive practice in the stock or commodities markets that induces investors to make purchase or sale decisions on the basis of false information". I for one am sure sick of watching my money wither away because of these fake ladder attacks toying with us. While also telling us its a good idea to invest in SILVER. If the fucking FBI just sits back while the largest Securities Fraud scam ever takes place our country has no justice.   Apes Unite!   HOLD!!!     Here's FBI Links to Contact
Comment below if you are a teenager and your mom worried about you investing in GME!
Admittedly I know very little other than holding DRIP investments - But why does one chart show the spike while the other doesn't even register a spike over 400 on the same day?
The ladder attacks start working in reverse at some point. Why would anyone sell at -97%??? To ‚Äûsafe‚Äú the last 3%???
At some point, people will just not bother selling at the ‚Äûloss‚Äú because the upside grows bigger and bigger.  Remember from the countless other posts you‚Äôve seen here that the chart is completely manipulated and there is no volume attached to these drops in prices. This is just a scare tactic to get you to sell!

We know the media is corrupt, Melvin is awful, and that SLVR is a joke.       Now seriously, what else can we do to make sure WSB holds the line and keeps our collective shits together.

Why WSB and the GME short squeeze are actually more important than they seem
WSB and the GME short squeeze are actually incredibly important to how the stock market might work in the near future because it shows that retail investors who want to invest in a certain stock (  they hear about a company they value that's shutting down) can cooperate into a larger investing unit - on the scale of corporate blocs if they have enough people - effectively influencing the fate of businesses while spreading out the costs and benefits among the individual investors to minimize risk and maximize reward (allowing everyday people to save a company they enjoy and potentially earn money for doing it without fear of bankruptcy, or defund corporations they dislike using shorts and also potentially earn money for it). It shows that the field is actually even if retail investors are allowed to conglomerate, and that the citizenry can have almost equal will over the fate of the economy as corporate investors by communicating and uniting with each other. Even though I only make $1600 per month as a full time, $10/hr employee, if I like a business that is going down due to what I feel is undervaluation - or even if I dislike a business that I think is overvalued (either due to overestimation of benefit to society or underestimation of cost \ cough\  \ cough\  every large Wall Street backed social media company \ cough\  \ cough\  blights to society) - I can come here and tell other retail investors like you guys why I think they should invest in/short the company I like/dislike too and turn the $100 I can safely invest every paycheck into something much more influential depending on how much of a case I can make for/against that business. When retail investors work together, we act as the correcting force to the over- and undervaluation forces created by corporate investors like what is happening with GME and all of the other undervalued stocks that are rising right now because of WSB.

DONT GET FOOLED
This is just another cheap manipulation of the market. This is call a ladder attack and it wont work unless u sell your shares. For those who are not familiar with this kind of terms: they are basically tradding a couple thousand between Melvin Capital and their friends lowering the prices each time they trade shares. By doing this they just push the price lower and lower, and you will ask: but can they just push it lower and whenever its enought low but all the short shares that are in debt? Technically yes, but no, I mean they can push it till 1$ if they wish, but it wont work unless somebody sell some shares. So do not be afraid my darlings just check the   "Trading Volume"   stat and you will notice the trap. Stay calm and dont be smooth brains, just remember we are some autists diamonds hands    and buy the dip.        Disclaimer: not financial advice just like the STONKS.

Some Motivation for GME Spoken by WBS very own Mark Cuban. "If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do." - Mark Cuban
\ \ This keeps getting removed... hopefully it will stick.\ \ \ \   From Today's AMA with Mark Cuban, READ THIS.  "If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street."  I see some WSB posts that are totally panicked. We need to remember why we are here in the first place. Do you want to see the Hedge funds win? NO! then HOLD THE LINE AND DON'T SELL!!!!  ü§≤       Spoken by a fellow autist, this is not financial advice, I just like this stock     EDIT: Fidelity Investments has held true for me this whole time. Check them out.

We need to find a trading platform that...
won't limit sales, wont cut off trades, and not shut off or stop working during peak trading hours.  Mark Cuban was clear that this dip is happening due to the "Robinhood Dive", they shut off our power to trade which is letting the suits rule the market at the moment. What do you guys think is a good platform? TD Ameritrade? E-trade? Moving to a platform that wont limit us is key right now!     My last post was deleted, not sure why but finding a trading platform that won't kill our buying power is extremely important, lets brainstorm WSB!
Do not let them divide and conquer
Their strategy is simple. Restrict buying inflow which allows low volume sell pressure to crater the stock. Not only does this kill morale, it also triggers a bunch of margin calls allowing them to take away more shares that they desperately need.   What to do? I‚Äôm holding. But that may not be enough. There seems to be a lot noise about if they closed their shorts or not. No one will know definitively until the official numbers are out. There was huge volume at the end of Friday, I assume it‚Äôs possible a portion was covered then. If they continue to restrict shares we are looking to buy over a long enough period of time, they will win. UNLESS we buy the fucking dip and hold to our convictions; war isn‚Äôt pretty. I know that we‚Äôve made a statement but so many times has the world forgotten about the latest social movement just because the higher ups know that time kills unity and motivation in times of FUD. Buy if you can, hold at will, and continue to learn. Most importantly, don‚Äôt lose what you can‚Äôt afford to. Good luck everyone.   GME
STOP SELLING
Who the fuck is selling??? I‚Äôm pretty sure most of you didn‚Äôt average in at $50 and taking profits the people selling at giving Melvin exactly what they want!!! And most of you are selling for huge losses. If you‚Äôre still holding down 65% of your port like me I salute you my brother. Don‚Äôt be a bitch and buy in at a discount price!!!
U Mad? Go File a complaint with the SEC.
Instead of counting Tendies that you should be Giga Holding, Go File a complaint to the SEC. Any number of great posts describe what a short ladder attack is and who stands to gain. The tactics have been obvious for a long time now, day in and day out.    Do your own research and submit a complaint!   If you feeling the GUH, go empty that into the SEC's ear. The NUMBER of complaints WILL matter when this goes to court/Hearings.
$AMC   $GMC - Down 50% on both   STILL BUYING

From Wendy's to Tendies: A Story of how I got my   ü§ö
I never really make "story time" posts like this, but it feels appropriate and cathartic today...  Once upon a time I made over a million dollars from a very early investment (off a Wendy's paycheck) into fairly well known digital  currency  (automod preventing the name). No, that's not where the money came from in my other posts. I lost that million, completely. I was wallstreetbets before this existed. I literally found out and learned about said  currency  from 4chan /b/. I lost it because when it peaked and fell, I sold for other  currencies , then those fell. I didn't trust my gut. If I held I would have multi millions by today's price. That said... I didn't have my    yet.  I got into GME because of extensive research throughout last year. I bought in and kept averaging since November. I liked Michael Burry's viewpoint, I like Ryan Cohen and believe he can do big things and I love games/tech.   Basically, I like this stock!    I never once viewed this stock as a short squeeze play or anything like that. Being overly shorted was what made me confident I had a good entry point in a future value company, something the public had not yet accepted. People still thought it was brick-and-mortar only.  That said, Something smells.  There is plenty of DD on this sub and others, so I really don't need to restate things, but I'll briefly break it down...  \- The numbers here don't add up.  \- The volume and price don't make sense.  \- The story is still wrong (brick and mortar... how can they push this still)  \- The media lies (silver being pushed by reddit  )  I really have no true clue what the outcome will be. Everyone at this time is hoping for a short squeeze, and maybe it will come to that. I hope it does, that will be pretty fun to watch and maybe I'll get to be in the movie. But if it doesn't, do some other kinds of research, you might find that GME has a future outside of being a meme. Quite frankly it's NOT a meme, even now. So I knew I could do this, I knew I found my   .    Stay strong, you might have a smooth brain but you have a strong gut! Believe in your gut and follow your conviction.    Lastly a quote I read last year that feels appropriate now...   ‚ÄúDon't ever take a fence down until you know why it was put up.‚Äù    ‚Äï   Robert Frost    WSB took a fence down and maybe, just maybe, we are starting to see why it was put up in the first place.
On discount today, got more bang for my buck (I was gonna buy regardless)
GME Gains on PUTS (Don't come at me, let's be realistic)
Look its very simple, GME is sliding to its inevitable death. Hold if you want but if you're losing a shit ton of money sell and switch to PUTS for 2/5 just make sure to sell them by EOD today or tomorrow. I'm in for $90 puts exp. 2/5 and I've already made a $1000 back.
Anyone else get this bullshit, canned, lie from Robinhood?
FUCK THEM for going against their Business Statement to help the traders that dabble.       A note from Robinhood  Hi    peasant   ,     We wanted to reach out to you after a transformative week in the markets to answer a question we know many of you are asking: ‚ÄúWhy did Robinhood limit certain stocks?‚Äù¬†     We understand that the temporary limits we placed on certain stocks this past week were frustrating for many, especially since we built Robinhood to expand access to investing. We have always sought to put our customers first and we want you to be able to invest on your own terms.¬†     To help explain what happened and why we had to take action, we wrote   and captured the key understandings for you below:    For Robinhood to operate, we must meet clearinghouse deposit requirements to support customer trades.   Deposit requirements are determined in part by how much stock a firm‚Äôs customers hold. If a firm‚Äôs customers‚Äô holdings are volatile, a broker (in this instance Robinhood) is obligated to meet higher deposit requirements.   Last week, in part due to   in some popular stocks, Robinhood‚Äôs deposit requirements rose tenfold. The combination of the deposit increase and the extraordinary increase in volume on these particular symbols led us to put temporary buying restrictions in place on a small number of those stocks.¬†   We had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile stocks to ensure we could comfortably meet our deposit obligations.   We didn‚Äôt want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren‚Äôt trying to help hedge funds  .¬†  We hope you take away this:   at Robinhood, we stand with everyday investors participating in the markets  . Standing by our Robinhood community means being there for our customers through any trading environment. We‚Äôll continue to improve as we break down barriers in the financial system to open it for all.     Thank you for being a part of the Robinhood community.Sincerely,   The Robinhood Team

6 Real Discussion Questions about GME
First, I have 300 shares and 2/5 call options in GME, so my answers to these are biased. I am honestly trying to get others' points of view on these.    1) Why is Ryan Cohen Silent?    Opinion: He doesn't want the risk of potential market manipulation    2) Why hasn't GameStop issued shares?    Opinion: They think it will go higher.  At this point, I don't see any reason this company should not issue shares if they want to thrive long-term.    3) Why is the price having 50 dollar swings in microseconds? See post by   u/MindF_ck  Opinion: The shorts are trying to trigger stop losses to buy shares. They are also trying to create artificial volatility so RH and others have an excuse to limit buying.    4) Why isn't the SEC enforcing the ridiculous number of GME "Fail-to-Deliver" shares?    Opinion: They haven't been pressured enough. See #DeliverTheShares on twitter to help the cause.     5) GME is going on a week of heavy news coverage and not slowing. When is the last time anything was covered to this extent and for so long in what is typically a 24-48 hour news cycle?    Opinion: It ain't squoze. Scare retail into selling    6) What vehicle should I buy when (if lol) it squeezes?    Opinion: Falcon 9 rocket (used)

Hey Melvin Capital, Robinhood, and any other broker partaking in market manipulation RIGHT NOW, here's a big FUCK YOU!
We all know this battle is being drug out by big money; they're losing, they're scared. They're calming down right now because the price is artificially driving down. Revolt, Robinhood, and other brokers are aiding the bears; they're making sure the common (wo)man can't purchase in. It's blatant fucking market manipulation. Do not give up. We will find a way to prevail. If you didn't sell your shares at $450, then DO NOT FUCKING SELL THEM NOW.   These bears are going to try any and all tactics they can to win, but DO NOT FUCKING GIVE IN. This is probably (definitely) the most OBVIOUS market manipulation we'll see in our life time. The average investor is winning. We will continue to win. They wouldn't go to such great lengths if they weren't shitting there big ass diapers. FIND A BROKER AND BUY. THE. DIP.      APES STRONG TOGETHER

I understand, in a way, why organizations are restricting the sell of GME. I‚Äôm not smart but platforms and organizations didn‚Äôt learn anything from 2008.   They always find a way to bail out wall street

Hi Y‚Äôall,  Long time lurker here but wanted to give everyone a heads up that RH stopped blocking my buy orders so far today (holding 5 before now holding 15). Maybe there is no limit again?  Obligatory post that I am not a financial professional and don‚Äôt listen to me as I am a full blown retard.

I'm down from $310 to $90 a share. This is a very harsh reality.
I'm a new retard and I need to know a few things from any og retards
I'm new, I traded in super late at ¬£200, got a few shares and now im broke. I didnt trade anything I'm not prepared to lose.  Everything I've seen here about a brotherhood, sentiment and standing up for the little guy goes against everything I've learnt about the stock market but whatever.  I just need the cold, hard truth of whether or not I'm going to make a profit. Obviously nobodys an oracle but a seasoned trader comes pretty damn close to my definition of one.  I'm not in this to show the big bad hedge funds a thing or two. I'm in this purely fo make a disgustingly selfish profit and that's it. If it covers my debts then i'll give the rest to aids research or something.  Blaze me all you want, but make sure to leave an answer to my question at the end.  Thanks for reading
Revolut no longer has buy option on $GME. Any other alternatives for us from EU? I don't want to miss this dip.

Revolut restricting $GME and $AMC trading
From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE:   GME  ) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:   AMC  ) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.     ### What does this mean for me?  You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday‚Äôs (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.  None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.     For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you‚Äôre not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you‚Äôll be able to see them in the app.  ### Why is this happening?  When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.     The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners.     This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.  ### When will they be available again to buy?  This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.     Team Revolut    Capital at Risk    The value of a stock may fall as well as rise and you may get back less than what you initially paid, and in some cases the stock may lose its entire value and you may lose your initial investment.

Hi I have 10k to invest into anything right now what would you guys recommend will go up this next week?
This is what ya get when to try to buy AMC on Cashapp.
Just bought 2 GME shares with the money I had left to feed my family for the rest of the year. This is on discount right?
What's the argument for GME at this point?
GME went to the moon, and like one of Elon's shiny rockets, it is coming back to earth. I have no idea how all you apes can see 60% losses in two days and not panic like Harambe himself when the baby dropped into his exhibit. That's really what's going on here. You all had a shiny new thing in your zoo exhibit, and now the hedge funds are here to put you down. Good luck and godspeed my fellow apes. I wish the best.
The smart people sold Thursday.
It's a sinking ship. Squeeze is ending. A majority of the shorts have been bought. Buy puts
Why GME and AMC holders need to be looking at on balance volume to have an idea of what's going on with these volume and price movements. A little helpful DD
Newbies  , skip this paragraph.   Non-newbies   (and people who actually bothered to do 5 minutes of research about volume price movements), the   tl;dr   is that the gradient for OBV is not proportional to the gradient of the price decrease, indicating a bullish divergence.   I got a few PMs about my   and what that little blue line called on balance volume, or OBV means. OBV basically gets a positive or negative value based on if the prices are going up, or going down at that time. So in theory, when price rises, OBV should rise at the same rate to that increase, and vice versa.   However, the useful thing about OBV is in the name - it's weighted by volume. This means the more shares that are bought/sold, the steeper the OBV line (or gradient). So in this gamestop selling run, we would expect such a crazy price decrease to be followed by a similarly crazy decrease in on balance volume, since a lot of shares would not be in the hands of retail investors, theoretically. However, the OBV line has barely moved. What this means is that the price has decreased far below what most people are holding it for, comparing it to the first OBV rise last week when everyone bought into GME. This in turn means that the price is being changed by barely anything, and it really hangs in the balance of a few trades right now.    But what are the statistics???    In today's price drop we saw 5 million shares negatively impact OBV against a total balance of   billion, that's a factor of   and is microscopic compared to a daily increasing rate of 25% last week. That's why everyone here is going on about volume - there isn't any. If you're still confused, go on tradingview and bring up the on balance volume indicator, and look at the past 7 trading days.  Just trying to prevent y'all from panicking so much.
GME FIRESALE! BUY BUY BUY HOLD THE LINE.

STOP SELLING. I KNOW YOU PAPER HANDS ARE DOING IT
There has been a lot of selling going on in the last 20 minutes. The volumes have gone up and up. Stop selling you paper hand mother fuckers.  Edit: I have been watching the Time and Sales for the last 30 minutes and its been a surge of retail investors selling. Its not been the same as yesterday. So I know you assholes are selling. Also, lots of people buying WAY OUT OF THE MONEY put contracts as well. I see lots of Feb 5, $6, $7, $8 strikes being bought at 1 contract. Have some Bull Balls
I feel like i owe it to   was 6k, gonna spend the rest doin therapy

Revolut set to Sell only the GME and AMC Stocks!
We cannot buy anymore GME and AMC, just sell! Unfortunately i have just heard about this horrible news for us fellow Europeans! But We cannot give up, I belive in Us!

WTF IS GOING ON?!
Please really dumb it down. I'm not sure why this is happening. Are we selling now? If so, why wasn't there a fucking signal that wouldn't be detected by the enemy?!
Write off Losses on Taxes
This might be a dumb statement cause I'm a retard like a lot of y'all but to give you all an extra motivation to hold is.. you can declare losses up to $3,000 in your taxes anyways even if you lose. JUST SAYING. Wait am I correct or wrong? I'm not a financial advisor. Me an APE   üèª
Broke ape helping where he can.
You know what frustrates me the most about GME? Is that after a year of getting the crap beat out of us, they can't even let us win just this once‚Äã...
This year has sucked. Covid, sky rocket unemployment, people losing their homes, people dying, people having to choose between their health and putting food on the table, a government not giving a shit about us and thinking 1800 bucks was enough to survive off of for 10 months....   Then we get lucky, and yes it was luck, no one thought GME would break $100, and they even decided to take that from us. If they had just let us cash in last week, most likely everyone would have sold and gone home by Friday. The end. But no, they couldn't let us common people even have a crumb of the pie...   So that why I'm holding. Not bc I think I'll make mass profits off my nine shares, but bc after all the other bs I have had endure this year, this is the end of my rope. So fuck it, I'm here to stay.

How to blowup Hedgefund Trading Books
Congrats, y‚Äôall did it, you stuck it to a few hedge   in reality you did very   you know who the largest lobbyists and contributors are to the current system? Vanguard and Blackrock are the 800lb   , but any other passive fund manager like State Street, Pimco, Capital Group, Fidelity etc... hedge funds are long all the same crap, you sell you market funds and just move to cash, you take all the passive cash inflow momentum out of the market  These massive Trillion+ asset managers make the rules, they run the market. These are the same companies you willingly contribute money to monthly, paycheck after paycheck. By blindly giving your money to them every month, YOU AND I PERPETUATE THE CURRENT MARKET STRUCTURE AND SYSTEM THAT KEEPS 100s OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN DEBT SLAVERY, WHILE DENYING AMERICANS HEALTHCARE THAT WONT BANKRUPT THEM AND COST OF LIVING THAT DOESNT ALLOW THEM TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE.   If millions of of GEN-Z, GEN-Y AND MILLENIALS  liquidate their holdings, take profits and sit on the sidelines, markets might wake up.   Trillions of $ from 10s of millions of boomers and 10s of millions of younger Americans (Genz, millennials  etc) all go to passively buying and supporting the system boomers want you to support.  If you really want to stick it to the suits, pull your money from your 401k, park it in cash or a money market fund, actually stick it to the suits by not participating in the market.   Taking down one smash and grab short-seller isn‚Äôt going to change anything.   This will wake up the government that the young, the generations expected to shoulder the burden of the terrible economic, social and healthcare-related decisions made by PowerBoomer class, demand a more equal shake. We shouldn‚Äôt be expected to pay 5x what Boomers paid for their rent and housing, 20x what they paid for their education, 5x what they paid for cars and so much more.   The lobbyists at Vanguard and Blackrock are  , they took down Melvin and exposed   this will only increase their dominance, control and power over the markets. They pretend to care, pushing Environmental social governance BS and other strategies, but in reality, all they care about is the accumulation of power, via their capture of the US Gov‚Äôt, US Senators and Representatives and US capital markets
Buy the DIP!!!
Apps to use other than robinhood
Yes yes yes ‚ÄúROBIN HOOD BAD‚Äù but i have stock in it. Now I want to buy at the dip but out of $200 it only gives me access to $40 which is blatantly to keep me from buying gme. What are the apps you guys have been using?
Buying the dip? Yes, please! $GME!
Our Viking whale deleted his twitter again, where did he go to?
Good morning
Oh shit, I overslept. So, anything happening yet today?
GME lots tell a different story
I know you broke idiots don‚Äôt sell in 100, 200, 2000 stock lots. That‚Äôs all I see in the bid/ask spreads. Where are the 1s, 42s and 69s? This is all manipulation by the big guys to cause FUD.  Holding          Edit 2:   I'm starting to see real paper-handed lots now (odd numbers, small lots) and the stock stopped dropping. But then these even 100s/200s pop up and bring it down from time to time. Obvious trickery    Edit:   Please don't take this as a reason to YOLO money you can't lose. There's still a real risk of losing money. Hold the stock because you like it. I've invested what I can afford to lose and will take my losses over the years to pay less taxes (US, what the hedgies do anyways) or win big with the squeeze.
HOLDING & BUYING MORE. ARE YOU?
I added 1 x GME @ $135 and 6 x AMC @ $  to my portfolio during premarket. How did we go from 780K GME shares outstanding in premarket to   outstanding when the market opened??? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?
BY GOLLY WE'RE IN THE THICK OF IT! HOLD FELLOW RETARDS!
Holding 6 shared in Dubai ! Till the end !
Not much but all I could do
So this just happened on CashApp. Can't buy AMC
Yall What Do You Guys Think About Ticker BIOL? Is It A Buy?
Ppl believe GME to 1000 are none the better than Trump thinking he still won the election
Right comaprison?
It‚Äôs not a lose till I sell!!!!
Holding the Line = ‚ÄúBagholding‚Äù
There is no ways this world would ever allow everybody to cash a winning ticket at the same time. Algos are taking over this trade and smell blood.
We are spread too thin
We are loosing this fight by fellow retards recommending stocks that are never going to squeeze. Amc isn‚Äôt going to squeeze, they just did a stock offering. Nokia isn‚Äôt going to squeeze, too many shares with too big of a valuation.   The only two stocks that will realistically squeeze are GME and SPCE. Spce just had a downgrade, has a lower float than gme and is highly shorted. GME is questionable at this point due to the manipulation. Just look at the charts for all the ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù stocks, they are practically the same at this point, meaning shorts are winning.  Tldr, focus on gme and spce  Positions SPCE 2/5 60c GME shares
I didn‚Äôt hear no bell ü•ä üçø
Lost? Here is what you do - BUY!
Down 60% but STILL HOLDING.
Morons stonks go up because of positive revenue and growth.
What you are seeing with GME is part David vs Goliath and part fraud pump and dump at this point. Save your Trump bucks. Go to casino.
Salary buying GME again!!
The price has fallen it‚Äôs a great time to get back into GME if you sold and made your money! We need to get the price back up because there‚Äôs no way these shorts have covered  Edit: Start  buying GME again!!

Revolut in UK not letting me buy
From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE:¬†GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:¬†AMC) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  What does this mean for me?  You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday‚Äôs (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.  None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you‚Äôre not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you‚Äôll be able to see them in the app.  Why is this happening?  When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners.  This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.  When will they be available again to buy?  This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.  Team Revolut
Actual question
Yea yea, GME to the moon,     and stuff. Obligatory I‚Äôm holding my GME and not selling.  I know little about stock, less than many of you. I have GME and AMC, but I want to learn how to stock market. Let‚Äôs step out of the war on wall street for a minute.  1. The general rule of thumb is buy low, sell high, right? 2. AMC is dipping hard. I don‚Äôt want to sell my GME, but I want to experiment with AMC. We all know the dip is fake, so does anyone know when the stocks rise back up? I want to be able to turn my 4 stocks of AMC (I don‚Äôt have much to invest, stfu) into 8 or more. Does the stock rise in after hours, or do we need to wait for another wave of people to buy AMC for it to rise?
Don‚Äôt sell!
The most important thing to do rn is not sell. If you can buy at the dip then do it but if not just hold. By selling you‚Äôre saving the hedge funds and at this point probably losing money so hold on it until it goes back up.  I‚Äôm not giving advice this is just my opinion and I love the stock.
Where to buy now??
it's obvious that RH is still pulling their classic BS, so I suggest buying GME/AMC/ other short stocks over at Fidelity or Cashapp!!! Come on let's all go to the moon and leave RH behind!!!
at revolut have taken $GME ticker off their stock offering at open this morning. More restrictions on buying for retail but not for HFs
GME depressed
No Buy in cash app
So how‚Äôs Fidelity?
Getting out of RH now to someone that won‚Äôt fyck over all of their users in their greatest time of need. Do y‚Äôall like fidelity? Is it user friendly or just 1000% boomer
ANYONE GOT THE LINK FOR AN SEC COMPLAINT?
Might as well
Still holding $GME
If others can lose 100s of thousands, what's my paltry sum. Diamond hands forever!!
i appreciate you guys
unfortunately, im 17 at the moment, so im not able to buy or hold stocks (though if i could,  ü§≤) but i do just want to say thank you to everyone in here for informing me on both the stock market and how easily it can be manipulated. i‚Äôve always had an interest in stocks and how they work but i never had a clear understanding of them, and this sub has taught me more than i ever thought i would know. seeing all the details come into play and having people who are willing to explain the situations and what specific terms mean, gives me a better knowledge of something that might play a key role in my future. i know it isn‚Äôt much because im not buying anything, but thank all of you in this sub for showing me what those lines and numbers mean. it‚Äôll impact me in more ways than you‚Äôll ever know, at least later in life. im rooting for all of you, have fun on the moon boys
Am I doing it right? (Need advice - poor but trying with my last beans!)
BUY AND HOLD GME - DO NOT SELL
We need to HOLD GME, no matter how much the price has gone down. If you are thinking about selling due to feeling scared about the price drop, then you have taken the bait from the hedge funds. Selling helps the hedge funds and screws us. We are all monkeys together, we need to all buy and hold so we can win. My portfolio is down 52% and I am going to hold my GME shares no matter what.
Amc buyers! Hold!!!
Come on ladies and gentlemen.  Hold the line, don't be fooled.  Don't sell, fight these bastards!

Down 16K. I'm not selling, so it's not a loss.  ‚úä
Oof
What should i use to get started trading? I was going to use robin hood but i think they might not be around soon...
A message to anyone new to this sub who joined in the last week and is now selling because of the dip.
Fuck you. Seriously. Get the fuck off this sub.
Sold all my $BB to buy as much $GME as possible
Bought high. Bought low. Still holding.
ü§ö This is it Boys ! üòé There is no more going back.   holds

Lol, these hedgefunds think they can scare me away from gme, tbeyre just discounting the stock i like
Slid in @ $85
After cancelling my after hours buy for GME last week just for me to wake up and robin hood denying anyone from buying. My fidelity account finally authorized me to trade. Bought 2 @ 85. Been a long time coming....

where is the help with GME
GME in South America
Is there any app in SA that GME buying is still available?
Everyone here is trying to save their own investment by forcing other people to buy sayin shit like 'We knew this day would come'
Buy the dip. I did buy the dip and I escaped before it hit below 150 because I could see people here doing the same old pretending to not look at the situation pragmatically, instead using emotions to make their investment go up. Beware, they're gonna sell when it goes up because they know that it's over now. It was a great run, but it's done now. I know people with 07 karma is gonna call me a bot but all of us know what the truth is. We did make a dent in the financial market and it makes me feel hopeful for the future of retail investors.
Cash app restricting buys?
Cash app pulling a RH by not letting people purchase $AMC. What is going on???
I trust you guys!
I just bought 13 at 115 it‚Äôs not much but it‚Äôs all I could, and I‚Äôm gonna hold, I hope you guys are right, I believe!  Also question, when is it time for Nokia and AMC?
Im color blind. Is it green or red? It all looks the same to me.
I had one share of GME. Saw it drop to $110. Bought one more. I hope the end game is nigh.
I don't know what is going to happen. I'm hope I'm helping to doing my part. 100% portfolio in GME. Let's go, folks.
I joined the war boys!
For our European regards you can still buy using etoro and 212T!
$GME below $100 BUY THE DIP
currently GME is at $86 a share, BUY THE DIP YOU APES!!!  not stock advice, i'm as retarded as you are
All you      are bagholders now
True apes still holding $GME for the dividend. Dividend diamond hands
Some loss porn for you animals - anyone think this still might go up any?
Owwww....
Chomsky and Herman developed the idea of manufactured consent. This is the exact strategy the media is using against us in their fight to reshape the narrative to the public about GME and AMC
Being a smooth brained individual myself, I was surprised at the visceral negative reaction the large (and only the large) media outlets had to us fucking up Shitron. Naturally, I began to do some digging and I realized how stupid I was for not putting two and two together. The only correct response to us has to be a hissy fit by dominant mass media outlets. They are owned by huge players with big financial interests in the market. Being profit-making corporations, they must cater to the financial interests of the owners at the end of the day so of course, they would lash out in an attempt to mitigate the financial downside to their masters.   My point here is that if we had grown up rich and gotten greedy then some mouthbreathers came out of the woodwork and called me out for my illegal immoral actions, we would lash out too.      TL;DR Feel sorry for the poor media for being big mad at us for messing with their owners
üá´üáÆFinnish autist still holding. I don't care if I loose all my money. I will hold.ü§≤ üá´üáÆ

Hitting $500 was the squeeze we all waited for. This is it. It‚Äôs over. We missed out. We held the bag.
Won‚Äôt stop can‚Äôt stop
Just a reminder
Low GME
Well, thanks to whatevers happening with GME currently, was finally able to invest in a stock I‚Äôve liked for awhile. Only 3 shares for now but i think ill hold on to it and see where it goes.
Head you guys were missing some loss porn?
Buy the dip, but not yet.
Hello, to whoever reads this in the 5s before it gets deleted by mods, here's an idea.  For all of you who are considering buying in or buying the dip, does it not make sense that as long as trading restrictions are in place, the price will continue to fall?  Therefore, if you were going to buy in, would it not make more sense to wait for restrictions to be lifted? Especially given that the amount of available shares being traded right now is ridiculously low so if the shorts were to try and cover now they would still not be able to.  Anyway I'm just a fellow retard, so if someone would like to explain why I'm wrong about this, please go ahead.  tl;dr  if you have GME, hold  if you're planning to buy, wait  (not financial advice, not a professional etc. etc.)
Not a YOLO
Y'all know what? I"ve got 1 share of $GME that I bought on Robinhood last week at $  that is currently at $104, I have opened an account at fidelity and put in an order for 1 $GME limit at $95 and just bought it and have already lost value  on it. As soon as I am able I will be moving my 1 share from Robinhood and closing my account with them.   I'm just a stupid   with a brain so smooth that when in the light is a blinding mirror that doesn't know what he is doing but       Sorry, forgot to say I really love this stock and this is not investing advice.
For those that can't buy AMC on CashApp (get Fidelity)
It was instant for my application for an account to get approved. I was able to add my bank account, transfer funds, and start buying stock. The money isn't technically posted to my account, but it allows you to buy AMC at the sale price. (just make sure it goes through). This isn't any investment advice     Also, I just like the stock
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a loss until you sell‚Äù-old investor guy
Get Schwab
I know that RH and a lot of brokerage firms are doing their best to drive GME down and prevent us from buying more shares. Charles Schwab had continued to allow the purchase of these stocks. Let the market decide the best firm- try Schwab.
SLV!!!
SLV!!!!

MODS PLEASE STICKY THE GME THREAD
Mark Cuban ama is so terribly and suspiciously timed. Doesn‚Äôt make sense to pull more momentum from gme. Please sticky it!!
My favorite paragraph from the Mark Cuban AMA this morning
In response to someone asking why the stocks are falling this morning   Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand.  They created a RobinHood Dive.  No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers.  Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls.  When that margin call happens, its brutal.  They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular   So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.
OUCH!!!
GME down to $90. OUCH!!! A friend bought one share at $360 last week and was very unhappy this morning. Told him to hold, he has lost most of it already anyway.
Let‚Äôs drive up GBLX! They patented the treatment to fight Covid and need the money to mass produce!!
We can be part of something so much bigger with GBLX!!
This is mad
‚ÄúI have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.‚Äù -Mark Cuban
‚ÄúIf you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would   have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.‚Äù -Mark Cuban   I wasn‚Äôt originally going to say anything prior to reading Mark‚Äôs AMA but since he brought it up I thought I‚Äôd just confirm.   It‚Äôs true. Hedge funds have been shorting GME this entire time. Especially on the way up. Though I can‚Äôt say for the really big names like Melvin, my dad used to work in this industry and his friends still manage and own some smaller hedge funds. These past weeks they‚Äôve been basically gloating to him about shorting the stock as it kept hitting all time highs. They think we‚Äôre idiots and are capitalizing on all of this waiting for us to fumble.   Considering I don‚Äôt have literal phone records of these conversations I get why many of you might not believe me but for those of you who care I thought I‚Äôd share.   Anyway...   Obligatory rocket:
I‚Äôm kinda worried but still holding!
GME & AMC... the squeeze is getting stronger. Hold the line!  üëä
GME down to $85, is it best to buy the stock or an option?
Considering YOLOing it, need OPINIONS fast lol. Thanks in advance
Smooth brained dumb-dumb question?
I'm new to this whole thing, but decided I wanted to be a dumb-dumb too, can someone explain to me how volume (which I'm assuming is amount of shares being bought?) goes up, but prices on stock goes down? I'm about as smooth brain as they come
Stake also stopped buys on GME, AMC & NOK. All hidden on watchlist & search
The ape motivation for dark days
"I don't know what to say, really. Two days to the biggest battle of our ape lives. All comes down to today, and either, we heal as a team, or we're gonna crumble.  Drop by drop, dip by dip. Until we're finished.   We're in hell right now, gentlemen. Believe me. And, we can stay here, get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell... one dollar at a time.  Now I can't do it for ya, I'm too broke. I look around, I see these rich faces and I think, I mean, I've made every wrong choice a middle-aged ape can make. I, uh, I've pissed away all my money, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who's ever told me to sell. And lately, I can't even stand the number I see in my portfolio.   You know, when you get old, in life, things get taken from you. I mean, that's... that's... that's a part of life.  The dollars we need are everywhere around us. They're in every dip we buy, every minute, every second. On this team, we fight for that tendie . On this subredit we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that tendie . We claw with our fingernails for that tendie.  Because we know when add up all those tendies, that's gonna make the fucking difference between being rich and being hungry ! Between living and dying! I'll tell you this, in any fight, it's the guy who's willing to buy who's gonna win that tendie.  And I know, if I'm gonna have any life anymore it's because I'm still willing to fight and die for that tendie, because that's what living is.  Now I can't make you do it. You've got to look at the guy next to you, look into his eyes. Now I think ya going to see a guy who will buy that dip with you. You are  gonna see a retarded ape who will sacrifice himself for this team, because he knows when it comes down to it your gonna do the same for him.   That's a team, gentlemen, and either, we heal, now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That's the stock market guys, that's all it is. Now, what are you gonna do?"

NMRK is dipping but it‚Äôs the only big money today

Do we hold amc
Look idk what a short is. I need to know is there a possibility it goes up?
What about Nokia?
I bought some Nokia stock and it keeps dropping.
What‚Äôs the deal with AMC? Is this hedge funds or people with paper hands?
Even if we were to expose them for what they did, what would happen to us?
Genuine question,   Sure the price is like 85 bucks a share now coming down from about 475, but even if the SEC found that these guys were manipulating the market (which I don‚Äôt think will happen), how will we get the share price back into the 500 range?
I‚Äôm a stupid   but please help me understand laddering. Can the Hedgefunds just keep doing it until they reach their goal? I‚Äôm gonna hold   but how does holding stop them?
I‚Äôm holding for forever cuz fuck them! But HOW does it fuck them if they are driving the price down anyways????
No idea what I'm doing so I'm just gonna hold on to these till the day I die
I'll hold until they are bankrupt if I have to.
This is only the beginning.
So my balance went into negative lol. It was all money I could live without so no big deal. I won't be in debt or eating  rat shit for dinner.  It was fun fighting with you guys. I felt alive for once in many years of boring day-to-day work and got used to it.  Jumping in this fight reminded me that I'm still alive. The extasy when the stonks went up, the losses that made me want to fucking throw up. I tasted the bitter and the sweet and I could notice that my heart's still beating. I had a lot of fun.     Wish you best, I'm gonna keep supporting you guys from the distance now.     APES TOGETHER STRONG! üëä.
Been reading about the fight, thought I'd join in. Their lies can't reach an Ape on the moon.

Down what I (we) can't afford, but why doesn't it hurt?
I'm down $500 today, which for me is a LOT. Many people are far worse off than me, so it's just a number.  I'm in this. I hardly knew why, but I am. It must be said that I initially just wanted to pocket. Yea sure, fuck the system and all and I liked what this stood for, but I honestly wanted to get in, grab some for myself, and get out.   Well. Now I can't sell. I can't bring myself to do it. And it doesn't hurt, YET.  I see now that it will only hurt if we lose. I don't want to lose to the HF, not my money. If we win, I don't care about the money. A lot of us put up a cost to fight. I'm paying mine. But if it's all for nothing and we all crumble and sell, that's where the real loss lies now.   It isn't 2008, it's 2021. They've only gotten richer since. They have all the tools at their disposal to fuck us, more than they did in 2008, and they're fucking with us  I don't want to lose. I don't think how they're causing us to lose is legal, so that pisses me off.   Let's fucking win. For the cost of all of us monke-headed diamond balls, saddle your keister back in that gorilla and ride with us.   I'm ready to lose if it means we win.
I'm doing my part!

I'll Die On This Hill (GME)
In 2008 my dad lost his job, he lost his retirement, and damn near lost his house. I was 18 when that happened and it tore me up to watch it. By now we all know the story of the excessive risk taking and the bailouts of banks. There's never any consequences for them. I still feel the anger when I think of the pain we went through for their greed.  This whole GME boondoggle has a similar ring to it. Large fund tries to short a company into the ground, selling more shares than are in existence with hopes that they bust the company and no one ever finds out how many of those shares were real and how many were fake. DFV and WSB picks up on it and what does the fund do? They double fucking down (excessive risk taking). Why? Because they need GME to go bankrupt. Never mind the lives ruined by demolishing the company. The company in this scenario is GME but this tactic is used across the board on a daily basis with no regard to the effect they're having on peoples lives.   I don't care if my position goes to $0. I'm in this to keep this in the headlines and to drive change. SEC needs to start looking at selling shares naked. SEC needs to put regulations on swapping failed to deliver shares resting the clock for funds. SEC needs to investigate why we weren't allowed to trade this stock.   84 shares of GME at $118.  Godspeed. Hold the fucking line, ignore the price.
They are rejecting my BUY orders, motherfuckers!

This is the final test, if we get through this, we will be a global force with a potential to change the world, many times!
The stocks are going down, really down and downfall won't stop for some time. I know a lot of us are seeing all   if we somehow hold and pull through this, we'll have completed the full cycle. We'll be a unit that is powerful enough to change anything in the world and we'll create tremendous wealth for each other. I don't mind if this group becomes all powerful, because it started with the right cause.  Let's fight  's go for the glory! We can make history here..

Short laddering at it's finest. I would love to punch them in their f   king faces
They don‚Äôt want us to win :(
Revolut (DriveWealth) is restricting buying of GME and AMC from 02/02/21. Read the email i just received below. They are essentially doing what Robinhood did last week.
‚ÄúTrading Update for GME & AMC Hi,  From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.  What does this mean for me? You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday‚Äôs (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.  None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.  For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don't want to show you stocks you‚Äôre not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you‚Äôll be able to see them in the app.  Why is this happening? When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.  The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security‚Äôs holdings on broker‚Äôs books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth‚Äôs clearing partners.  This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.  When will they be available again to buy? This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.  Team Revolut‚Äù   HOLD  üèº
I know you sick fucks enjoy this so here ya go. HOLD THE LINE!!!
Is it time to drop nokia?
Nokia seems to have normalized back to where it was before all of the hype around it. Is it time to dump or should we hold on to it? I'd love to put that money elsewhere but I'm having trouble selling it through my interface.

$GME - f  the hedge funds short, INSERT GTC SELL ORDERS
Hello,   Few disclosures and what could be a massive tip to turn this around   Disclosures:    \-I'm not a financial advisor, research and do your DD etc.. you're responsible for your trades    \-I'm also a short seller sometimes, and I don't get the hate against them as a category (we can happily chat sometimes and clear this out)    \-That said, I am long GME stocks, and I'm holding! You guys did something really remarkable here!   What I learned through trading:      Your brokers are lending all of your shares, which empowers short pressure! But if you have an OPEN SELL order, they need to get them back from shorts!   They can't have a sell order from you and still have stocks borrowed.   So here's what I'd do:   insert sell order at $1000 USD   (or whatever insane high price), Good til cleared, and enjoy!

GEVO will be a winner in 2021
\ not a financial advisor - just my personal opinion\   Mad about what happened today and trying to recoup losses into and then some throughout the rest of the year? I might have a play for you that could 4x your current investment. I consider myself in a lot of ways to be an investor that spends a lot of time research high-growth stocks that have a clear market fit/product that will grow into the future. I was actually an early investor in NIO at $12 a share and sold around the $55 dollar mark with 4x profits. I like NIO, but I feel that the general EV market is in a bubble considering we are still years and years away from EV adoption in all cars. If you asked the EV manufacturers to supply the entire American public with EV cars and infrastructure - it would be impossible as they cannot scale and produce that rapidly. With NIO in particular - I mainly sold because I see the renewable energy stocks to have a more promising future in 2021 than EV cars since it's going to take them time to scale, and I don't expect them to repeat the same success in 2021.  Where did I put that profit? I put it right into GEVO as I believe BioFuels are the most sensible short-medium term solution for the world we live in. I am not crazy how GEVOs revenue numbers have been in the last few years, but I'm going to let that slide because of environmental/political factors that will sure to make it a major player in the future. On top of that, Biden elected the former co-founder of GEVO into his science cabinet which only increases my confidence. Right now, GEVO has $500M+ in cash on hand, zero debt, and over a billion dollars worth in potential contract value.  If you've been following the news - you would see how the big oil companies are growing concerned regarding regulations on the new administration - as even they see the writing on the wall. What I predict is, GEVO has the renewable patent technology they could license to these oil companies. Big Oil will partner with proven technologies before trying to re-invent the wheel (look at what happened with FCEL and Exxon). Big Oils conversion to clean energy is going to need to happen - and I'm expecting GEVO to land some partners soon.  I am currently holding 1600 shares at a cost average in the high 9s and feel that GEVO on the low end is $30 by end of year, and $60-70 on the high end. I think a lot of partnerships will start popping up soon and new adoptions in the green energy space by the Biden administration will cause this to really pop.
I panicked!!!  bought more!
Heard you guys are into this
I am down on my AMC and NOK, still hold right?!ü•≤
The Truth
We‚Äôve been affected by a false-positive of thinking this was because of us, the little guys. That‚Äôs just the catchy media narrative at first.  It wasn‚Äôt because of us, you and I both know that. Squeeze was predicted in summer and stayed flat for a long time. It was never about the hedge funds, we just wanted some fuckin tendies and calls. No one even mentioned the names Melvin and Citron back then, just that it‚Äôs shorted.  Living under the disguise that because of diamond hands we can change what‚Äôs happening won‚Äôt be pretty. There‚Äôs no way we catch back up to the MOMENTUM of mass worldwide media coverage, Elon tweeting, every celebrity/grandma talking about it.  And even if we did, the clearing house, sec, dtcc, brokers, will do everything to prevent it again.
Keep on going!
I cant join in the mess, but I can at least encourage all y'all! Hold until they break!
I want to remember the name Mudrick Capital and Jason Mudrick, who made $200mn from selling OTM calls on $AMC and $GME... at our expense... your time will come
Am I doing this right ?

LONG on NRZ - Sorry no short squeeze
New residential absolutely obliterated their dividends at the beginning of the pandemic, dropping from .50ps to .05ps. Their stock prices dropped accordingly as well. The thing is, there eps hasn't dropped which makes me think the divided decrease was reactionary to covid. Each quarter they've been increasing by .05 cents and their press conference is scheduled for Feb 9th. What I'm hoping is the div will increase from .20 to .25 or even better... if they restored it back to .50 per share. That would be great because I've been buying every dip while the shares are down and hoping to get some nice quarterlys in the future. I'm definitely long on this which is why I'm posting here and please let me know if I'm way off base. This will not get you rich over night but I need something stable in my life to counter act some of these other plays. Ath is around $18 and currently it's hovering around $  I'd say we have a good chance to make it to $13 after the news. Please share you thoughts!

In the stock market, the greatest sin is marrying your position
Take it from me, newbies; I lost $700k a year ago betting against the S&P. I rode the market crash to a 300% gain, but continued holding as the market recovered. I was so certain that surging COVID cases and record unemployment would bring the SPX crumbling down again that I held my puts all the way to -90%.  My conviction had blinded me to a simple truth: I had become more invested in being right than in making money. We're all wrong sometimes, that's just part of being human, and unless you factor this into your investment strategy, your portfolio will eventually go to 0.  So never marry your positions. Know why you went in and know when you're going out. If circumstances change, your plan has to change as well. Cause otherwise, the market will just turn your diamond hands into dust.

This subreddit contains the majority of the board of directors with being high quantity shareholders of $GME.
Yes, we like the stock but this is also a side effect of having people like u/deepfuckingvalues and u/potato_in_my_ass who hold tens of thousands of shares.  $GME has to connect with all who own a large enough position within the company, even if they bought the stock just because they like the stock. That shows that the shareholders are more likely to want to help $GME to grow and grow the company‚Äôs profits.   To those waiting on the GME board making some sort of statement, this is likely why it‚Äôs not happened yet.   I am not a financial advisor, just a recent college grad with two bachelors in Business Admin.  Edit: I remember u/potato_in_my_ass being one of the big guys with DFV at the beginning. I mayve wrote the username incorrectly. It was mentioned in an article I read a week ago or so.

Sofi sold all my shares without my permission today. Had a sell limit at 10k, no it was not a leverage account.
Do not be the LAST person holding the bag
Seriously folks, I have been around and seen many wild and crazy markets. I have been around this board when it was few hundred thousands. The short squeeze is most likely over, it‚Äôs now a bunch of redditors and retail investors left, the shorts have likely covered and moved on and funds won‚Äôt touch this with a 10 ft pole. Where is the fuel for the rocket ship to $$$ gonna come from?   I have lost my share of money over the years and I hate to see people losing their shirt because of disinformation and manipulations. Be careful out there.    I have no position in GME, AMC or any of these shorted stocks, and would never buy it even if it drops to single digits because the fundamentals are not there.  Downvote away...
86 @ 280 average (2 accounts). 50% down. Not selling
It ain‚Äôt much, but it‚Äôs honest work.
This says the short interest of GME is 36%, as of 2pm. If that‚Äôs true, what‚Äôs the actual play if you‚Äôre holding?
I‚Äôm not a bot.   I like the stock.   I‚Äôm holding my measly handful of shares of GME to be a part of the movement.   I tuned into Mark Cuban‚Äôs AMA and got wood at him saying hold if you can afford to.   That all being, if the short interest truly is 36%, what is left of the original play toward a gamma squeeze. The only reason this play was ever a play to begin with was because of the 120%+ short interest GME originally had.   Some say the squeeze is yet to come, some say it happened last Thursday.   To those truly holding, how truly confident are you that this will still rise? And, if it‚Äôs not about the short interest, then what is your play for holding?
Holding till the end
I did my part and I'm not selling. -21000 so far. Only play with what you can afford to lose.
The reality of the GME situation is that we don't know for sure what's going to happen. The people who are saying that it's definitely going to zero are acting on just as much hopium (dreadium?) as those saying it's going to $10,000.
NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.    Alright guys and gals, I know that the very essence of this sub is meant for circlejerking the massive gains and losses that only the truest ~~gambling addicts~~ geniuses of the stock market have cooked up over time, but most of you need a reality check.  Calm down, gay bears. I'm talking about you too. Put your bear dicks back in your bear pants and listen up.  Here's the reality of the situation:  nobody knows exactly how this is going to play out . Unless we've got some Ms. Cleo ass motherfucker out there with tomorrow's lottery numbers and the Superbowl results in the palm of their hand, there's not one person who can definitively say how this is going to go.  When you jump on here looking for reassurance of your position, you're going to find that. It's called confirmation bias. If you think GME is going to the moon still, you'll see that. If you think GME stock is about to be sold next to the discount toilet paper and $1 pregnancy tests at the local Dollar Tree, then you're going to see that too.  I probably don't need to tell you that you shouldn't have spent your life savings to buy into a meme stonk at its height. That's just some free general life advice. Since you're reading this, though, let's assume that you did, and you're currently trying to decide between $ROPE and $BRIDGE. Take a breath and calm down. There  is  evidence of short laddering. There  is  evidence that the volume here strongly favors buying. It's entirely possible that they're actually setting themselves up for a massive resurgence.  On the other hand, it's also very possible that this stock is well and truly toast. As much as I've enjoyed watching the comradery around here and the exultation of the truly retarded among us, some of you need to face the reality that there are millions of subs here and only thousands of comments. There are plenty-- plenty-- of people who hopped in at $50 and cashed out at $500. If you think the  only  factor in the steady price decrease since last Thursday is Melvin, then I have bridge to sell you (but please don't jump off it- come on, you can always make more money, but you only get one life).  Do you know why it feels so good to be a part of this, no matter what side you're on? Two reasons: one, social cohesion, which most of us have been missing for a long fucking time because of this shitass pandemic. Two, psychologists have known for decades that unexpected rewards trigger a much higher release of sweet, sweet dopamine and serotonin. When you don't know for sure a good thing is going to happen, and then it does, it literally feels better than when you are expecting a good thing to happen and then see it come to fruition. This is why gambling is addictive. And if this is your first time being introduced to the addiction centers in your brain, well, welcome aboard- hopefully it has been a lesson for you of the good and bad power of your own mind and what it can do.  So   GME still moon? Yes. Could it crash and burn? Yes. Both of those circumstances require the right combination of factors to happen. If you're sitting here all day staring at the chart and tearing your hair out-- stop. For real, stop. Close the tab. Go outside. Go hug your wife or her boyfriend and tell them you love them.   You have already paid the admission price for this ride, so you may as well ride it. If you can't take the heat and want/ need  to sell because you have a life to live, then do that if that's what you need to do. Don't hang on just because some rando on the internet posted some fucking gorilla emojis. On the other hand, if you consider your investment to be money you were truly willing to lose and want to see how this plays out, then that could be fun too. It really  could  rally. It's not over just yet, but you gotta fucking be honest with yourself about your limits and tolerances here.   Apes together strong, but billionaire hedge funds also strong. Do your  own  research, come to your  own  conclusions, and quit sucking on the hopium/dreadium teat long enough to make a decision on what to do from here.  Edit: forgot my positions: 36 GME @  , not planning on selling but  I can afford the price of this ride .
IM NOT SELLING...     STRONG TOGETHER
$GME should buy Dave & Busters
This is not DD, this is smooth brain speculation, but hear me out:  Part of the vision of GME's future is their takeover of the esports industry. It could be a lounge for casual/competetive gaming, a training studio, and of course, a retail giant for all kinds of games, collectibles?, and PC's. What do you need for this? Space. Dave & Buster's already has the infrastructure - hell, they've already done 3/4 of the work for you. All GME has to do is some light renovations/remodeling, add/remove games, and change the signs (what kind of name is "Dave & Buster's" anyway?).   mean D&B... also has food/drink, areas for the kiddos to play, and is a spot to go watch live events (MMA/Boxing, Superbowl, etc). More revenue streams for GME.     PLAY's market cap is currently   There are 140 locations (89 currently open from a quick google search). The others are currently shut down due to Covid, so it would be a perfect time to start renovation on those. Many of these locations are in Malls (can't find the exact number). Malls may seem like they are dying, and many of the stores in them are. I believe malls are here to stay, but they won't exist as the retail experience we remember from our childhood. Many malls are still thriving, and those that are have adapted to become experiential social zones, with retail as an added bonus.  Let me know if this is retarded. Thanks.

For the smooth brained normies who bit off more than they can chew (seriously though)
This also   isn't   financial advice as I am also a smooth brained normie- possibly even a monke  Many of you got way too invested in the hype of the idea of a short squeeze and bought more than you can financially handle in the long and short term.  If you really believe in your stock, and love it, and love the movie theater experience and that weird smell when you're walking down the blue carpet with weird little multicolored squiggly lines. And you love the in-person experience of trading in your console games for a dollar and playing crappy demos with the controller attached to a wall. AND love(d) playing brick breaker on the most underrated smartphone ever with that little scrolly ball thing instead of a touch screen, then   trade it as such  .  The stock market has recovered from every major crash in history (inflation-adjusted too) .  If you can't hold, you can't hold- but a great way to ensure break-even is to place a sell order for   half   your shares at,   at least   2x the price bought at.  for those who have smoother brains than me (impossible) it means this:  "I bought 5000 XYZ shares at $10 and oh shit I need money to live long-term oops"  \- instead of blowing it all when XYZ is $6, place a limit sell order for   at least   $20 for 2500 XYZ which   should   ensure break even   if   it is filled (depending on brokerage fees). Let the other 2500 XYZ ride 'til you die. Obviously, you can hope the price will double in a day, but it's always good to make the limit order GoodTillCanceled so it doesn't expire after a day.  That being said, this is not financial advice cause I have now come to the conclusion that I am a monke  to the moon!

The event that made a needed correction.
For those that feel the pressure of being down 70% on whatever value you put in, you bought into a movement that is shining the largest spotlight on a long standing problem. We are in the part of the movie where even long time, fair play market professionals are finding that corruption really has infiltrated every facet of the process. The business of short selling is to feed on death. You make sure you‚Äôre in the will, and then you go to work on killing Grandma. The practice has ruined a lot of business hopes, but no one is there to protect Grandma anymore. Even the night shift watch gets a payout. But they over reached this time and someone noticed. A junior player said, why even hide what we do, there is no stopping it, and literally started injecting Grandma right in the middle of the community game time. And they got asked, ‚Äòhey, what‚Äôs in the needle?  Are you a doctor?‚Äô  There may be a significant loss between 60% and 90%, but you did join the rare opportunity to join a community outcry to require a hard look, and hopefully a correction to an industry that once again is out of control. Hopefully that means something to you.   I‚Äôm thankful that my money was already in position. That I could join this gathering, and that through the worry of losing it all, that it could result in some oversight on a business of promoting a good company by investing in its future, not have its head cut off by the machete wielding bully right out in broad daylight.   77 GME @ $89 214 TSLA @ $50 (  and yes I‚Äôm still pissed off about how hard they went after Tesla too)     üèª +   +

WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?
As I write this GME is trading at \~$103/sh with a $  market cap.  I'm writing this to talk about GME objectively, not that "to the moon"  or "10k isn't a meme" bullshit or some stupid misplaced crusade against wall street. I'm here to make money.  Right now GME has $586M in CACE ($140M of which is restricted so really $446M to do whatever they want with). Their assets have shrunk most notably from writing down almost $2 BILLION in goodwill over the last couple years. Right now the company has ZERO in goodwill, basically saying it's brand is worthless. I disagree with this after the hype WSB has created for this company. On the liability side, as of Q320, they have $224M and $216M in s-t and l-t debt, respectively, for total debt of $450M.    GME PLEASE ISSUE STOCK.    I know it will dilute the shit out of SHs and drop the price but I think it would be a huge buying opportunity. The fact that they haven't already is incomprehensible and arguably negligent. They could've issued 4-5M shares when this thing was over $300 at $200-250/sh and brought in $1B cash. But that's irrelevant now. What they could do is still issue stock, I'm not sure what price they could get for it but I'd be a buyer. Let's say they issue 5M shares at $100/sh, that's $500M cash... $500M would be HUGE in transforming the business. Up that to 10M shares and they bring in $1B. I think $1B is > than $500M but I'm wetahded.  So I titled this "WSB POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVISM IN GME?" because collectively we own a shitload of shares. Could we not push for the company to issue stock here? Could we not send a letter to GME like HFs do but with           üèΩ.  They could use $250M to pay down debt and the other half to really catalyze the transformation.  Video gaming is a growth industry and yes, brick and mortar is slowing dying, but as DFV said in his original thesis, that's a long way off.  GME needs to use the hype that WSB CULTIVATED for its brand and capitalize on it. The company couldn't have asked for a better xmas present than what's happening now. People are buying fucking billboards for GME. The company could be to gaming, what Chewy (a >$40B market cap) is to the pet industry. And clearly Ryan Cohen feels this way, too. GME needs to entrench itself into the gamer lifestyle and I really think raising funds now would accelerate this.    Financials    Right now I'm estimating GME will make $5B in revenues in 2020, so we're trading at   depressed revenues. For comparison CHWY trades at \~6x revenue, per yahoo finance. This is a company that made >$8B in 2018 and 2017.  They recently reported holiday sales (Nov and Dec) of $ , down   yoy with 11% less stores open. SSS comps   yoy. But here's the most positive, digital sales were +309% yoy, and $  ytd. As digital sales grow, this should help alleviate SG&A expenses which have historically crushed profitability. In 2017, 2018, and 2019 SG&A was $2B, and for 2020 it's looking like it'll be \~$     Valuation    This is a very basic back-of-envelope calculation. But if GME can return to \~$8B in revenues (which is entirely possible and reasonable IF they can execute). And maintains historic GM's of \~30%, we get $  in gross profit. And if digital sales continue to make up a larger chunks of revenues and they close redundant stores, they should be able to keep that SG&A expense under $2B. Let's say they can get it to $ , which is about $100-150M above what SG&A will probably be this year (accounting for store reopenings).  So $8B revenues, 30% GM, $  gross profit, $  SG&A = $800M in operating income.  Assuming \~30% tax rate => $560M in net income.  If this plays out, we're currently trading at \  ($ $560M) what could be a reasonable net income # in the next couple years. My point is that GME might not be as overvalued as people think...  Anyways, please call me out on any bullshit in my thinking/logic.

Not coming from money has made it easy to hold
I don't know if anyone else can relate but I'm not used to having a lot of money in my bank account.  I'm turning 33 this year and before 31 years old, I never had more than maybe $2K in the bank.  Ever since I started making "a little bit more" money, I never felt right. It was weird seeing all this money in my account and not doing anything with it. I never even knew I was supposed to be investing the money and not letting it sit stagnant in a chequing account.  So I put more than half of my savings into an ETF and threw $10K into the BANG stocks. That's right, I did BB, AMC, NOK and GME all at once.  Seeing my BANG investment drop today didn't even phase me. But I'm not rich whatsoever. I guess I'm so used to not having any money that it just didn't matter, lol.

Each $GME share is basically a blank check
The billionaires and hedge funds screwed up big time and they know they're fucked. The autists of wallstreetbets here are battle hardened vets that have been through wars. A lot of us have lost 99% before. These dips are when we buy more. We're in a historic moment here. The hedge funds know they're fucked.  Theoretically each share could be worth an infinite amount of dollars. If no one sells, that's the price they'll have to pay. I think it's time these hedge funds billionaires lost their yachts and mansions and have to live in a normal house like the rest us. This is a moment where we're taking back what they took.  Realistically we can probably get $35,000 a share on average. This would put GameStop roughly around the same market cap as Apple. It could go up to $50,000 a share. Anything is possible.  This is not investment advice and is for entertainment purposes only.

Every reason why running a stop-loss order is bad right now.
If they keep us diving a wave of stop-loss orders will trigger, which means the price will really plummet HARD soon.   They can see your stop-loss order in the public order book right now   and know how much they need to ladder to make your sell order trigger. We should consider turning off our stop losses NOW or else they will keep doing this till we are in the ground. There isn't much time left. If we do this then we can hold out till the next series of covering.   Hold   and let the interest on their margin compound against them. People need to hear about this now, please. Not financial advice, I'm not an advisor.  This is why it's so important to only play with money that you are literally 100%%% fine with losing right now. It's stupid to buy if you plan to daytrade, panic sell, not hold over the weekend, or for any reason other than faithfully holding. It doesn't matter if all you can afford is one share. Everyday you hold is another day the interest builds up for them.  This is the 6th time I'm trying to upload, admins literally fuck off. We need to get the word out now. I had to made this so vanilla to get it up  Don't show them you're hand              These pictures are not from me. I'm not taking creds for them

Purchase of GME in settlement?
I purchased an additional 10 shares of GME at the dip on my Chase brokerage account   The money was taken from my account, but my positions remained the same and there is a little "p" next to my funds.  I called Chase asking about this and they said that they don't know why this is going on and that they can confirm that I did in fact buy 10 more shares.  They asked if I wanted to sell these shares and I said no, but that I wanted to make sure I could if I wanted to(at the moon). They said that if I needed to sell, I was going to have to call them and have them place the order for me.  Is this shady or am I overreacting? This never happened with my previous GME purchases.
It ain't much but it's an honest loss
Loss Porn for y'all. This shit hurts so bad but I'm still holding

Are you guys willing to buy but unable, or are you guys out of GME for good?
The recent dip in GME was caused by so many brokers disabling buying, not necessarily people selling.   We all saw what happened, brokers fucking over their audience because of hedge funds, and they cite "Volatility" as an issue, in that case, all we have to do to be able to buy, is to hold, and the volatility will diminish.  Things is: if brokers allow buying, how high are we going to go?   This is a discussion so we can see if GME is meant to moon after brokers allow buying , or if the short squeeze is dead.  Leave your opinion below
These "paper hands" are filled with money.
Reverse gamma squeeze incoming
Hello fellow bag holders  Here's my shitty DD, take it with a ton of salt cause I actually, truly have no idea what I'm talking about       Thesis:     This Friday and next Monday/Tues is going to experience the drop of all drops for GME due to expiring options being HEAVILY skewed towards puts     Looking at the yahoo options chain ( :     Total calls expiring ITM (strike price <= 105) : 16,337  Total puts expiring ITM (strike price >= 110) : 25,797  Net difference : 9460 more put contracts expire ITM, leading to an added   946,000 shares worth of selling pressure     On top of this selling pressure, similar to the gamma squeeze we saw on the way up with MMs buying shares as prices increase to cover the calls they wrote,   they will be selling shares as prices drop   to cover/hedge puts they wrote which are now ITM     I have no idea if this makes sense    Position:   GME 19Feb21 110 P   Lost money on the way up, lets see if I can lose money on the way down also
I would gladly do it again. Thanks for sticking together you crazy bastards. üëâ  ü¶ß

Why we need a $GME flair
(Repost)  WallStreetBets has become mostly $GME posts which is understandable because we are in  a  historical battle against hedge funds and every post can make a difference. But, WSB is not only about GME. Some people can't afford it and others don't want to invest in it anymore. So, I   propose making a flair or filtering system   for all new posts related to $GME to preserve  the quality of this SubReddit like it used to be in preWW3 phase.  WSB is much more than $GME and no matter how it ends, we still have other high quality posts buried underneath all of the $GME posts. Have people   forgotten how we raised $AMD and $TSLA from the ashes to what they  have  become today? and there are many other plays like that which we started  right here.   Bottom line is, This community shouldn't be reduced to a GME  only community because it's much more than that...    EDIT:  Some Melvin type of bullshit is happening in here... This post was previously banned the first time it was posted. In addition, some comments are being hidden by the mods. Now tell me, What's the difference between us and them if we pull the same shit when we get the same power? silencing me is against all what  we are standing for...
Hehehe
A spark
Retards, Autists, Brothers and Sisters.  Today we have lost a comrade. Someone who has given everything he had to support us. Someone who believed in doing the right thing, and standing up for it.  I am talking about the ViKING.  On friday, he fought the short ladder rigorously. But their schemes have come to haunt him, and deal a devastating blow to him. Still, his spirit and wishes for a free market still exists in every single share you retards are holding preciously.  Make sure to pay him the respect he deserves. Also, make sure to stand your ground, no matter what. We may have lost this round, but as long as we do not falter, we are going to win the war and avenge our fallen brother.   No matter what, do never accept being treated as the ‚Äölittle man‚Äò. Fight. Even if it takes your last breath.  Take the last bit of spark left in your soul and turn it into a devastating fire.  Hold in this war and those to come. Hold like you would hold your firstborn. Hold like there‚Äòs no tomorrow.  Hold til‚Äò fucking VALHALLA!  //EDIT:

VW & GME volume charts. Time to end the Qspiracies and sanity to come back. The mysterious Viking has left the battle, shorts are largely covered and retail is selling/ losing interest. What is there left to hold for?
Ok listen up retards
The market is fraudulent. If you‚Äôve seen The Big Short you know what I mean. Wall Street, the SEC, rating agencies, the media, and politicians all collude to maintain power for themselves while we are left to fight in the dark for scraps. That‚Äôs why GME and WSB scared them so much. They are beginning to realize their grasp on power is slipping and are going to do it everything they can to take back control.   Think back to the housing collapse and Occupy Wall Street. Wall Street broke the entire economy by offering as many loans as people would take, it didn‚Äôt matter if the person applying for their sixth housing loan was working part time at Wendy‚Äôs with $100k in student debt. They were making so much money, they didn‚Äôt care, and the revolving door between Wall Street and the SEC meant there was absolutely no accountability. Then comes Occupy, where idealist people came together and said ENOUGH! You can‚Äôt just destroy millions of families and then get bailed out for your trouble!  THIS SCARED THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF THE ‚ÄúELITES‚Äù  They saw that the veil was briefly lifted and everyday people that they treated like retarded filth could see the corruption and that the system was corroded from the inside out. They knew that CLASS WARFARE was  coming and soon the plebs would kick out all of them from their ivory towers and rebuild the system to better suit the majority. They couldn‚Äôt allow this.  They needed to divide us so that we could be more easily controlled. This is when identity politics and intersectionality began to be pushed in our society and culture. Instead of us being divided between common people and the elites who control our system, we had to be divided based on race, gender, sexual orientation etc. so that THEY could maintain power as we squabbled amongst ourselves. Left and right alike our politicians SOLD US OUT. No matter what you think of Trump, he was a reaction to all of this, not the cause (although he did make the division much worse).  Now once again the veil has been lifted. We can see the blatant lies and misinformation pushed by the media to keep us at each other‚Äôs throats. We can see Janet Yellen has made hundreds of thousands of dollars from speaking on Wall Street. That Jen Psaki‚Äôs brother is a portfolio manager at Citadel. That Wall Street will manipulate the markets right in front of our eyes and the SEC won‚Äôt lift a finger to do anything about it (unless it‚Äôs to regulate us retail traders).  The system has been broken for a long time and now that everyday people can see the corruption, they must stop us.  Well FUCK them! They just stirred the hornets nest and we WILL fight back and we WILL win. This is only the beginning.   TLDR: the system has been corrupt and broken for decades but now everyday people can see it clearly. The elites in power are on borrowed time.  TRCR:  üí™üèª

Of course hold GME    but it's always a good idea to stay aware of other things that are going on.\   I am a simple man. I will make a simple case for EXPI.   1- If any industry is primed for disruption it is real estate brokerages. Information is becoming more and more available. Who the fuck wants to keep paying 6% commission so some college drop out can unlock a door and read some info off of a sheet? Nobody. Real estate agents can go get in the go fuck yourself line right behind the investment firms. We don't need them anymore. It's not 1985 anymore.   2- Lets look at EXPI and how it's financials compare to two of its peers. Redfin and Zillow.  # Market Caps  Expi-    RDFN-    Z- 34b  # Net income  Expi- Profitable  RDFN- Not profitable  Z- Not profitable  # Revenue  RDFN's has half the revenue of EXPI  Z has slightly less then double the revenue of expi  # Simpleton's Math  Redfin has half the revenue and is not profitable and yet it has the same market cap as expi.  Z has 4x expi's market cap but only 2x the revenue. And its not profitable.  Even a dumbass like me can see that expi is trading way below the value of it's peers. A fair market cap would be around 16b which would put the stock price around $240. It's currently trading at $120
It's not much, but I'm doing my part!
I love a good porno. I think I need more.
Buying Put Options On GME?
I know, I know,   I KNOW, I might not be the most popular person here saying this, but   what about Buying Put Options On GME? I was thinking of buying put options which of course profit on the stock going down, but the risk is limited to the price of the options instead of this shorting crap. Short-term put options seem like a possibility here, EVEN FOR THOSE FOLKS HOLDING GME.  Buying puts could limit your losses and hedge your risk too! Buying puts by themselves, well, that's high risk but I'm thinking of going for it too!
Who Really Benefited From the GameStop Bubble?

The Journey To Green TENDIES Through Green Energy (ICLN) - Jan 2021
Alright, attention fellow autists. After a year of lurking in this sub, I've decided that it is finally my time to start a YOLO journey. Now, to make tendies in the future what do we need? That's right, fucking clean energy to cook my tendies of course. I don't want no tendies from fucking dirty oil and pollution, that shit's disgusting. Only boomers eat that tendies. May the power of fresh wind, sunlight, water and energy cook up the finest of tendies for me.  My positions in ICLN:        I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but here's my Ding Dong:    ICLN debuted in 2008 with the highest price of 60$/share during the time of oil fear but quickly got dumped back down over several years. The stock is currently trading at around 30$, only half from the peak.         But here's the catch  . Back in 2008, the renewable energy industry was literal trash. The technologies at the time were expensive and inefficient. Miniscule progress was made even with huge subsidies from many countries. Fast forward 12+ years and with improvement in technologies, prices for renewable energy have been significantly reduced -> more adoptions from the average households.       Many companies in the industry are quickly growing in size and turning profitable. Amongst ICLN's holdings, there are: Enphase Energy $ENPH (which doubled in size from 2018-2019), Verbund AG (largest hydropower provider in Austria), big solar players like First Solar $FSLR, SolarEdge $SEDG, Sunrun $RUN, and some other foreign companies.     Biden's Green Energy policies include plans to move the United States to 100% clean energy by 2050, boost jobs in the renewable energy industry, and up to $5 TRILLION incentives over the next 10 years.     Search results for 'clean energy' on the rise worldwide according to Google Trend.       Premiums still cheap as fuck with 2023 call options only around $500-800$.  I will be holding this position for at least a year and will be adding more on major dips. I will also update this position monthly to the sub. Join me on this crusade for a brighter, greener, and richer future. This shit literally can't go tits up.  TLDR and positions:  Buy $ICLN and HOLD to GREEN TENDIES   ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è. ICLN $45 Call Jan 20, 2023     Edit: Spellings

Dr. Burry calls out possible TSLA insider trading and gamma squeeze manipulation
Basically, Dr. Burry is very skeptical about TSLA's options trading  . We all know TSLA benefited from similar short squeeze dynamics to GME - with MMs hedging large amounts of OTM call options and putting pressure on shorts to cover. Anyway, Dr. Burry now thinks there could be foul-play involved in short term TSLA calls...        What do people think? I am not familiar with the Bloomberg abbreviations, but clearly he thinks there is some short term manipulation worthy of SEC attention.  There is also the mystery of why Musk is off Twitter. Not sure its sensible to make any connection, but it is curious for $TSLA bulls.

GME valuation DD
Confirmation bias incoming:  GME Is currently valued at   USD  The gaming industry was valued at 151Bn in 2019 according to grand view research.   GME made   Bn in revenue last year with no new consoles to sell.   Now let‚Äôs compare this to Chewy. (You all know about Ryan Cohen).   Chewy is currently worth  !!!!  The pet care market according to the same analyst is about   in 2019. (Was 131 in 2016 with a CAGR at    Chewy had a revenue of 6Bn last year.   So what does this mean?????????  GME is fairly valued at 41Bn if not more.   That translates to  $ a share.    This is not financial advice yadayada I is smooth brains I just like the stock.

Short Sale Fails in a Nutshell - MM Perspective
Saw a lengthy write-up about 'shady' short failure coverage tactics so I wanted to update you guys on what that actually looks like in practice for a trader.  This is prefaced by the idea that traders hold stock proportionally against their positions to get   Delta Neutral  , so they are not making directional bets on what stock does.  In situations like GME, traders get extremely short stock through their positions as a result of trading the other side of what paper is doing.  As market makers they have short stock sale exemptions due to their status as a liquidity provider, meaning they can sell stock short in all conditions to allow them to continue trading and 'providing liquidity' in the options markets.  Due to this, they will often encounter a   FAIL   on their short stock position if the short float is big enough and it is difficult to acquire stock.  They are told by their clearing firm that they need to buy in a % of their short position by the end of the day, determined by the size of the fail.  A fail is considered a short term problem for these guys, so this requires a short term solution.  In some cases the traders will get long stock through a   CONVERSION  , where they buy put, sell call, buy stock.  While this seems like a cop out there is an entire market around how they price rev/cons depending on the expiration of the options and the interest rates being charged.  The other main method to get long stock is to   EXERCISE YOUR CALLS  .  Very often market makers will have large call positions as a result of natural trading, and many of these calls can be in the money at the time of a fail.  Due to how expensive it is to hold short stock against these very ITM calls it can make sense to exercise these early, as the savings from the short stock position outweigh the benefits of having the position open.  This is doubly true when you're using the exercise to cover a fail, as you save money by exercising the calls early and prevent yourself from having to make a disadvantageous trade to cover.  Additionally, the market maker may try and prioritize trades in the open market that get them long stock, but that is usually at the cost of putting on trades for bad prices.  This is probably the least favored option for that reason, as it is a long-term solution that is often the least cost-effective.  Now this mainly applies to traders who are short stock as a hedge on their positions, but hedge funds that are naked short likely use conversions to cover a fail as well.  As you can guess from the fact that you're using options to get synthetic short stock while buying long stock to cover your fail, you will still be on the hook when those options expire.  Additionally, this   COSTS MONEY  .  Aint no freebies allowed in the trading world, so whoever you're trading those conversions with is taking their pound of flesh while you're putting a band-aid on your other boo-boo.  If the stock remains very hard-to-borrow and at a decent price level long term you'll continue to make the firms eat shit on their short stock, even if the price doesn't moon in the near future.     TLDR - covering your fails short term with options still costs money; if you keep holding, they keep paying
Mark Cuban Reddit on GME       üåï
To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:
All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.  Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).  But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:  ¬´If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.¬ª  This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?  They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to   HOLD   this is precisely what they fucking meant.   TO FUCKING HOLD  .   THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.    You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?  Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover,   patience is key.   Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good):    ¬´Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line¬ª.     Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart,   Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to   HOLD!   This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to   HOLD!   This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to   FUCKING KEEP HOLDING  .    JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?    MAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE       Not my post, but I had to share the word

$MACE - Mace Security International DD
My first DD post. Sources in comments.  tl;dr: Given current situation and positive changes implemented by the management team I see $ MACE  having a great future (personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of   Growth is fueled by political changes, worsening climate situation and changes in human behavior). This is one is to hold for long time. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.  Longer Version  My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, civil unrests, green revolution, semiconductors scarcity). Today I‚Äôll share my opinion about personal safety and security industry in light of current events.  Guns in USA ‚Äì Democrats have control, RNA went bankrupt, society at large agrees on stricter gun laws. In near future this might result in policy changes that makes it more difficult for people to get lethal weapons as means of self defense. However, a need for self defense is not going away any time soon and here‚Äôs why:  ¬∑ We have seen that during the recent civil unrest weapons and ammunitions sales skyrocketed. I think that fundamental issues which fueled these events are not going away anytime soon. Portland still rumbling in protests and Q is searching for space lasers‚Ä¶ People will want to protect themselves ‚Äì pepper spray or stun gun is better than nothing if gun laws change.  ¬∑ Covid lockdowns and restrictions pushed people to spend more alone in the nature. You know who else is in the nature? Bears! Demand in animal deterrent sprays should increase.  ¬∑ All the talks about defunding and rebuilding police. Sounds like there is a room to expand use of non-lethal weapons in most situations.  ¬∑ Dating world. Online dating accounts for most dates out there and that introduces risk of meeting some creepy person. Demand for personal safety alarms should increase. Good LinkedIn post on this:   Source 1    ¬∑ Climate change creates a lot of wealth disparity that fuels societal disorder. Throw on top of that explosive mix of economical, Covid, political issues and in my opinion what we are seeing now around the world is just the beginning of new normal. Critical mass of anger is achieved and this won‚Äôt go down so smoothly. When there‚Äôs anger on the streets people look to defend themselves.  In my opinion all of these are external catalysts for personal safety industry. Now about $ MACE , one of the old timers in this industry.    Company  : Mace Security International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells personal defense and security products to retailers, distributors, and individual consumers worldwide. Brands: Mace, Tornado, Vigilant and Take Down. The company distributes and supports its branded products and services through mass market retailers, wholesale distributors, independent dealers, e-commerce channels, and installation service providers. Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio.      History:   Founded in 1965, but it looks like company has lost its way at some point ‚Äì $ MACE  had carwashes as their line of business up till 2013 (  Source 2  ). Old management team neglected company‚Äôs online presence, so brand and sales suffered. Not much else to say here.    Now  : new management team since 2019. Has been working on changes and got struck with Covid shenanigans, but is adapting quickly to a current environment. Recognizes missed online opportunities and now is focusing on online sales. Q3 increase in online sales compared to Q2 is in triple digits (meaning 100%+) (  Source 3  ,   Source 4  )  Check out their amazon shop ‚Äì has lots of positive reviews.  When searching for ‚Äòbest pepper spray‚Äô, ‚Äòbest animal deterrent‚Äô I find articles, posts with Mace products. That leads me to think that online exposure has improved a lot and there will be large number of people getting same results when looking for self-defense products.    Latest Financial Results  : Q3 2020  Net sales increased $2,310,000 or 94% versus prior year, primarily driven by organic growth, addition of new customers both in retail and e-commerce segments and new product line extensions at retailers.   Gross profit for the third quarter increased by $1,016,000 or 108% over the same period in the prior year, driven primarily by increased sales volume, labor efficiencies, and higher margin digital sales.   SG&A expenses increased by $177,000 to $1,183,000 for the quarter, or 25% of net sales, driven primarily by higher variable sales commissions and performance-related incentives. Net income increased by $843,000.   Cash and cash equivalents increased to $549,000 as of September 30, 2020, an increase of $242,000 over the $307,000 on hand on December 31, 2019. Working capital increased by $1,860,000 compared to December 31, 2019. The company paid off its loan in the amount of $600,000 on September 30, 2020.   Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $889,000 (  cents per share on an undiluted basis for the quarter).   From earnings call transcript:   Source 5   (I recommend to go through it ‚Äì gives nice outlook on new management team results and their future plans)    Recent Catalyst  : Protest in US and increased demand in personal defense products, 94% revenue increase in Q3 vs last year, ‚Äò2021 OTCQX Best 50‚Äò award (  Source 6  ), one-year $  million Revolving Credit Agreement with Fifth Third Bank (meaning cash on tap:   Source 7  )    Upcoming $     MACE      Catalysts  : New product launch in Q1 2021 (mentioned in call transcript above), FY 2020 results (which due to all recent political tensions should show even better results than those reported for Q2 and Q3)    Upcoming Industry Catalysts  : Personal safety and security industry is projected to reach USD 5,5kkk by the end of 2025, registering annual CAGR of            Stock Performance  : short and little unfair comparison against industry leader Saber:        $ MACE  just touched 5 months bottom resistance point. In January after Capitol riots stock soared due to the whole industry (guns, ammo, self-defense) gains. I think that end of the month drop-off is due to people taking gains from speculation on January events.     Summary: I don‚Äôt expect here SPAC or pharma level returns, but steady growth instead. Would like to see $ MACE  trade in $ $2 by Q3 and consolidate there by the end of year. It also used to pay dividends, but that has stopped in 2011. Who know maybe good results will reward investors with some dividends? :)  My position:   shares at $      Few other good sources for your research:  Q2 slides, has SWOT analysis, discusses financial results and future strategies:   Source 8    Latest investor presentation:   Source 9    That‚Äôs it. Now do your own DD. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.
[GME] - Past Week in Review
Guys, I was a firm believer in the squeeze until I finished my DD last night. I hate to say it, but I think the jig is up and I'll show you my reasoning. In this document:  1. Melvin was telling the truth about covering their entire short position last week (. 2. Why the GME chart doesn't match the VW chart 3. If all the shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?  # 1. Melvin Capital DID close their shorts last Monday   . There is more than enough evidence they accomplished this last Monday.  First, check out GME price action and volume last Monday (1/25). I want you to pay close attention to the period between 10am and 11am.     Now take a  .  For their top owned holding (  of shares owned)    L Brands   (ticker LB), notice the price action on 1/25. They liquidated their holdings from \~10am-11am, which coincides directly with the jump in GME price.     Furthermore, we can get a very rough estimate at how much Melvin raised to cover their GME shorts. From   we can see LB volume on 1/25 was 17M shares. If we look across the previous 4 Mondays, the average volume on a Monday is <3M shares. It's likely that when Melvin offloaded their shares, they caused stop losses to trigger and unintentionally caused others to sell their shares, but if we assume Melvin raised the cash from all the sales, they made \~$200M from LB sales alone.  Here's another holding (  Ownership) American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) with the same price and volume action. The volume on 1/25 was 13M vs 3-5M for previous Mondays. Using the same napkin math as above, we get \~$200M netted above average volume.  Extrapolating this across their 119 holdings they could easily have raised the capital required to close at least most of their GME position. Although there is no data on their short position, assuming it was 10x their reported position in GME puts (50M), they could have easily covered the position in trading volume that day (178M)     Although I checked for quite a few of their holdings and saw the same pattern, I'm a retard when it comes to making these graphs and I'll leave it as an exercise to further validate.  # 2. Why isn't GME going to rebound like VW?  Most of you have likely seen the below graph used to describe the VW squeeze in 2008. One of the most notable parts about the graph is the massive drop in VW price right before the squeeze - why did that happen?       The great financial crisis crashed markets globally and VW followed suite - in fact, when VW stock began to fall, short sellers doubled down on their bets as VW was not in great financial shape which caused the very noticeable down spike in the graph above. Porsche had other plans, however, and announced to the world that it had stealthily accumulated shares and now \~90% of VW stock was out of circulation. This caused the sharp uptick and I would point out that there are no further rebounds following the initial squeeze.  Although GME still has many shorts, many of these shorts are likely not the ones that started before the squeeze and instead sold near the top with a much better cost basis. In fact, one of my subscribed newsletters sent out the below sage advice 4 days ago - and if I was smarter I would have listened :)  >"GME is one of the greatest shorts of all time. If you can get the borrow‚Ä¶ short it he told me. "  # 3. If all the major shorts have covered, then why are there no shares available to short?  This was another thing that had not been sitting well with me. If there are no shares available to short sell, then how has the number of shorts decreased?   First, touching on above - the current short sellers likely have a much higher cost basis and are unlikely to be squeezed like those caught in the initial squeeze.   Second, it's not clear how shares are made available for borrowing. I found   which gives the meaningful lines of text  >If you want to short sell a stock, your broker needs to call his or her firm's loan desk to see if the shares are available for lending... If the firm does not own it in their own portfolio they have to attempt to borrow the stock from other firms.  As a client of a firm,   your shares cannot be lent out to someone who is looking to short sell  . Shares are held in trust for each client and are kept on separate books.   If this is true, then the GME squeeze was likely a victim of its own success. By retail investors buying all the stocks, we prevented a continuous short squeeze by evaporating the supply of shortable shares.

TTCF Long and Potential Earnings Play
I came across an article about BYND where the author suggested that TTCF (Tattooed Chef)  is a competitor to BYND. Now I may be a smooth-brained autist but it seems that TTCF is actually quite different from BYND and has a niche in that it offers other popular food shit like stuff with cauliflower flour substitutes as well as plant-based meat. Also, in case you didn‚Äôt know, Beyond Meat‚Äôs ingredients lists are longer than your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs dick, and health-conscious people don‚Äôt like that. TTCF pushes a more ‚Äúfarm to table‚Äù notion that makes its products seem closer to the source, so it also differentiates itself from BYND that way.   Last quarter's net income was shitty compared to previous quarters (loss of   for Sept 2020 compared to 916K and   for June and March 2020 respectively). They said that the major loss last quarter was due to a ‚Äúnon-recurring‚Äù expense, which is not unexpected considering these plant-based companies have a lot of innovative shit to deal with in order to scale and preserve food made from natural ingredients that naturally go bad.   Another major thing to consider is their revenue last quarter compared to BYND: DESPITE THE FACT THAT TTCF HAS NEARLY 1/10 THE MARKET CAP OF BYND (  compared to \~11B ), ITS REVENUE LAST QUARTER WAS ONLY ¬Ω THAT OF BYND (41M compared to     Also, given that unlike BYND the big institutions haven‚Äôt jumped on board for this one yet, there is solid room for growth. Their earnings will be at the end of the month or at the very beginning of March. The last earnings report moved the price up big time despite net loss and this upcoming one likely will too.   I have a long position as well as 3/19 $30c and  3/19 $25c.
GME IS A FUCKING PYRAMID SCHEME
GME is a fucking pyramid scheme at this point. Even Mark Cuban, who everyone is fawning over in this sub, commented that it‚Äôs fucking over and people don‚Äôt understand how the shorts jumped in and covered last week. It‚Äôs fucking over people. I‚Äôm 4 shares in and down ~$600 and fully expect GME to hit $10 by next week.
Last week I thought I was one of you. This week I know I'm one of you. HOLD
It‚Äôs not much but APE TOGETHER STRONG
I bought 3 more! HOLD!!

CRSR Earnings Next Week, Could Mean
First things first, I'm not a Melvin or Citadel bot trying to divert your attention from the squeeze play. I've posted on here a couple times before, I'm just interested in continuing to exchange quality plays to keep our tendies flowing. If you have any doubts, check out my last DD on $SRNE from a few weeks ago:     Now, I know everyone is kinda busy right now with GME, AMC, BB, and the rest. However, if you do happen to be out of those names (or missed the ride and never got in), I have another stock that I would like to bring to your collective attention. Corsair Gaming (CRSR).  I've seen DD about this stock on here before, but it's been a little while and I feel like it deserves some more hype. For those who are not familiar, Corsair makes keyboards, headsets, and other peripherals for use in PC gaming and livestreaming, which is a rapidly growing market, especially in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns.  Corsair IPO'd back in September, and they crushed their Q3 earnings report. Their quarterly revenue increased 60% year-over-year, and their net income was up   384%.    They also released full-year guidance, and they expect to finish the year with $  in revenue and $187M in EBITDA. These are huge numbers when you consider their market cap is only $ ! At this revenue level, they would only be trading 2X sales, which is not high at all considering the current market and the high-growth industry they operate in. It's also possible that they see a revenue boost due to the recent console cycle. This brought increased attention to gaming equipment, and generated a demand that other major players couldn't keep up with. If you wanted to buy the new PS5 at any point since it was released in November, odds are that you couldn't. I don't really have any data to back this point up, but in my personal opinion, that factor could have lead more people to invest in computer gaming in order to play the new next-gen games that were released with the new consoles.  Holiday shopping season + console cycle + low supply of competing hardware could equal a blowout quarterly report.  After the recent events with GameStop, I am surprised that this stock isn't getting more hype because its situation should be right up this sub's alley. Corsair has about 90 million shares outstanding, but most of those are owned by company insiders until the lockup period expires at the end of this month. Right now, the float is only 25 million shares, and half of that float is owned by institutions and another 2 million of those shares are sold short.     In other words, there are only about 10-15M shares available to freely trade on a daily basis. This low float means that this stock can be easily manipulated by the big players, but this scarcity also means that in the event of good news, this stock could fly. Even if enough people try to pile in before earnings, the price could jump $5-$10 like it did last Wednesday.   Corsair is going to report their Q4 earnings on February 9th, and I think that leading into that report, they could move back into the $40 range. After their last earnings they ran from $21-$51, so another move over $50 is not out of the question. I still haven't figured out options, so I have no idea what strike price or expiration date you should be looking at, if any. I'm playing this the only way I know how, accumulating some shares while it's under $40 and holding 'till next week.  TLDR: High-growth gaming stock could crush earnings next Tuesday. Low float = high volatility, so any good news could shoot it up.  This is   NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE  , please do your own research before entering into a trade. Simply presenting a trade that I‚Äôm excited about, and I‚Äôd love some feedback.  Positions: I don't understand options, 250 shares @    Obligatory       for good luck

Can I sell now and buy back later at a lower price? (SPOILER - You most likely cannot)
Raise your hands if this is not your first rodeo and you too believed you could time the market with that much precision at one time or another?   üèª     People that are trading for the first time(s): When we start out we do this thing where we get some small profits (the lucky ones do at least) and then we think without respecting the big daddy in the room that shall later be named:   "Hey, this shit is easy! I can probably earn conservatively like 1% a day and I will be set for life in X years."   Menawhile...    Narrator:   COULD NOT.      Then, in a stroke of genius we think: "Ha! I am being greedy, I should be smart. I can EASILY make   a day and then I will be set in 2X years, but that is fine! Lol... those suckers that don't have any patience..."     And at every step you find out you really are way shittier at this trading thing than you previously thought. To either one or the other happens. You quit, or the market just whoops your ass so fucking hard with money that your greedy ass could not afford to lose that you actually learn something for a change.  Markets are brutal and merciless my dudes and gals.     The big daddy in the room I mentioned before it is called TIME. We want things fast and they usually happen slower than we'd like. We get anxious and then that magic button... MARGIN starts seeming like an appealing shortcut. You no longer need to wait for the market to move THAT much, you can have it move 10 times less than that and make the same money. That is another trap.     Look. I am not an investor. I am mostly a gambler that tells himself he is an investor because I have some sweet REIT dividends dropping in my account every month and once made 130% blindly trading creepto. Markets are brutal and you should only put in what you are comfortable losing. Not just in GME but anything with a short(ish) time frame in mind.     To answer the post title's question: You most likely cannot time the market going down RELIABLY than you can time it going up. You might get lucky. But don't attribute that to confidence. Anyone can be right on a casino where the bets are only GREEN or RED and nothing else. The thing is being right most of the time, and I certainly cannot help you with that. But if you put the time in, study something for a change and allow yourself to pay "the market's tuition". You just might make it.     Just please, don't believe that you are already there.

The courts have screwed so many with AMRN, lets get it all back
For many of us that invested into the new miracle heart disease drug from Amarin, the courts stripped us of our money and dignity by approving it for FDA, but not giving it their due by not allowing generics to sell their proprietary drug. This screwed alot of us over dropping the stock from the 20s to 4 per share overnight last year. Let's make them pay and get this stock to its glory.

Man up! Taken from other dude
Macadelicious 58m (sorry to hijack top comment)  To everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:  All of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.  Big hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).  But, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:  ¬´If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.¬ª This is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?  They are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to HOLD this is precisely what they fucking meant. TO FUCKING HOLD. THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.  You genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?  Hold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, patience is key. Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): ¬´Patience. Disruption is never easy or straight line¬ª.  Guys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart,   Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to HOLD! This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to HOLD! This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to FUCKING KEEP HOLDING.  JUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?  MAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE  Position: 15 shares supported by Europoor  (someone post this, please. Keeps getting removed)
Wow! A discount price so I can get the max amount of shares allowed on RH? Nice    boys!

MUDRICK CAPITAL GAINS $200 MILLION ON AMC, GAMESTOP BETS
(Bloomberg) -  Jason Mudrick‚Äôs hedge fund reaped almost $200 million on its stakes in firms that skyrocketed during a Reddit-fueled trading frenzy in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Mudrick Capital Management earned   in January, one of its best months ever, making the bulk of its gains on debt and equity options of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn‚Äôt public. The firm also profited from the volatility in shares of GameStop Corp. The $  billion hedge fund booked most of the gains on its debt holdings in AMC and about $50 million selling out-of-the-money call options on the stock last week, the person said. The shares surged more than 500% in January before retreating sharply Tuesday. Mudrick also profited by selling out-of-the-money call options on GameStop, the person said. A spokesman for New York-based Mudrick declined to comment. AMC‚Äôs Sudden Surge Makes Winners of Silver Lake, Mudrick Capital had provided $100 million of new financing to AMC in December to help keep the beleaguered movie-theater chain afloat.

So I just sold a GME share on etrade for $3200?
I've been waiting a long time for this moment
Sir, this is a casino.
Bought $10,000 GME at open yesterday. My only regret is that I didn't buy $1k an hour instead.
I have no idea how this is going to turn out, and I have to admit I've been rattled by the ladder attacks, but I don't see any change in the logic of the position.   My $10k buy put me up to 84 shares, at an average cost of $300. This was a lot of money for me -- the most I've ever risked on one trade -- but it's not so big that it would change my life if I lost it.   The way I see it, it makes no sense to fold now. In poker terms, I'm pot committed:   For simplicity's sake, I'm imagining only two "bad" out comes:      A.   no squeeze ever happens, and it goes to $5 -> I wind up with $400 at the end.     B.   a squeeze happens, and I'm so dumb I completely miss it, but manage to cash out (or just hold) afterward at $500. -> I wind up with $40k at the end.  Subtract the money I could "save" by folding now, and I lose about 9k in scenario A, and make about 30k in scenario B.   Even in this simple "pessimistic" model, if I believe there is at least a 33% chance that scenario B happens, I have a positive expected value here, and I should stay in. If I believe the price will go to $1000,  I only need a need a 13% chance of a squeeze to justify staying, and so on.  I think that's pretty much the situation that a lot of people here are in: it'll hurt to lose, but nowhere near as much as it will rock to win. So why would any of us back down?  The \ only\  thing I wish I'd done differently (other than getting in 2 months ago :D) is applying some dollar cost averaging when I bought, and broken it into a $1k purchase every hour. Assuming the ladder attack played out the same way, I would have wound up with more shares. (No ladder attack, and I'd be in the same position as I am now because the price wouldn't have dropped -- or if I missed the squeeze at some point, I might have fewer shares, but I'd still be enjoying the squeeze...)  Anyway, this isn't meant as financial advice. Just something I wish I'd thought through earlier...

Diamond hands are forged by smart decisions
Ok maybe this is unnecessary, but as we come into the 11th hour here, and the true paper hands are starting to come out, I think its important to talk about how to prevent paper handing in the future.  Sure, you can just have ABSOLUTE IRON NUTS and tank your way through all the tough shit, but its so much easier to do that with a real strategy. Yeah I get it were all retarded, but don't let performative retardation get in the way of genuine good decision making.  Maybe some of you will just call me a pussy, but you know what I did yesterday? At 300 in the morning I was feeling nervous. I had gained a lot there, but ill admit, My faith is in my brethren was being shaken. So I trimmed my position. NOT SOLD ENTIRELY. Just trimmed. Take some profit. Sold 15 out of 65 shares.  I know our lord and savior DFV has no exit strategy, and if that works for you thats great, but for most of us its important to note, WE WILL NOT PROFIT DOING THE SAME STUPID BULLSHIT HEDGE FUNDS DID TO GET THEM HERE.  They were probably profiting a fuck ton considering the price was down to sub 5$.  Instead of taking profit they kept riding it to stupid levels and utterly fucked themselves.  I know its fun to be retarded apes, I like to do it to.  But at the end of the day you hopefully aren't ACTUALLY a fucking idiot.  Hopefully you aren't ACTUALLY yoloing your savings because someone else told you to, and you're a dipshit lemming.  Have all the retard fun you want, but do so with genuine conviction.  BE THE SMART MONEY. We didn't get here by accident.  Were not going to the moon      on one 100% luck. Were lucky to be trading when the MOASS presented itself. We were smart to take the opportunity. Remember why you're here, and fucking  ‚úä     EDIT:  I only use reddit for porn and stonks so if im suspicious that why. Been commenting since GME was at like 20$ though, so do what you will. But hey, if you think im a bot, good on you. Think for yourself. Take in the evidence around you.

Addressing GME FUD & current situation
Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,  First ‚Äì Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon    This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked.      TLDR  : My opinion is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security.   They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday. If they get even 1 day without aggregate Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts. They need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.   No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.  My opinion is that Shorts don‚Äôt plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don‚Äôt have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a   threshold security   (see below) for 10 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). Shorts need to break that chain before it reaches   13 consecutive business days  . ‚ÄúParticipants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‚Äòthreshold securities‚Äô if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.‚Äù \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)    If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, then the shorts will have to cover the position by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity. If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13. Ape hold strong.    We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING!  Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.  \ Read below here if you can or care.  1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?  Shorts weren‚Äôt required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn‚Äôt good for them, but it isn‚Äôt as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a security threshold. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here    It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a security threshold before the positions must be closed (If the rules still apply to them).  So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.  2. How does that help the shorts?  Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.  Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.  3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?  I don‚Äôt think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.  4. We‚Äôve heard this before. So what?  I agree with the idea that adding RC & friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don‚Äôt think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker    Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don‚Äôt count weekends so the count resumes January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th. Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th. I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now they are in a similar position closing in on the 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.    Threshold Securities    Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for  ¬∑ Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and  ¬∑ Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and  ¬∑ Equal to at least   of the issuer‚Äôs total shares outstanding.  If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.  Conclusion: Hold banana with diamond hands to board the rocket ship  Relevant links  SEC -    See rule 204 ‚ÄúClosing-out Requirements‚Äù  Edit: 'We must hang together or surely we shall all hang separately.' - maybe some smooth brain that has his face on money     Edit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.

Guys and girls.  Beautiful apes with diamond hands.  I just wanted to post some encouragement.  This is actually my first post on Reddit.  I got an account long ago to join r/freefolk after the disappointing end of Thrones.  Good or bad.  Agree or disagree.  That forum taught me the power of the internet.  I decided in August of this year that I needed to take control of my own financial future.  That, win or lose, I should own it.  I bought some regular stocks.  Got my Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.  Stuff I believed in.  Then I started learning things.  My risk tolerance grew.  I learned I liked some digital currencies I can‚Äôt mention and got in with what funds I could back in September as they started to climb.  They treated me well.  I started following other subreddits like this one in the background.  I was thirsty to learn and willing to lose some money (and make it if the gods smiled).  I‚Äôve followed the logic with these stocks.  This is all a gamble.  I know that.  What has been exposed to the mainstream is that it‚Äôs all a gamble.  I think the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù hate that the most.  But this is a damn good gamble.  I missed the boat to get on GME last week but I jumped into as much AMC as Robinhood would let me.  I‚Äôve eaten my shirt on it but I continue to hold with diamond fucking hands.  I‚Äôm recently divorced and on my own.  There‚Äôs a lot I could do with that money.  It‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt afford to lose but I could use it elsewhere.  I won‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs to the moon or to the ground.  I thought I missed the GME bandwagon for good but then it started dropping.  I almost let the naysayers get to me and didn‚Äôt go in.  I‚Äôm already eating it on AMC but you know what?  I‚ÄôM IN AND I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING LEAVING!  Bought this morning at 114. Only a couple of shares but it‚Äôs what I can do.  I want on this rocket with you.  We go to the moon or crash together.  I can‚Äôt help but think there are others out there like me and there‚Äôs been such negativity.  No negative here.  Let‚Äôs do this!  My diamond fists are closed.  I‚Äôm strapped into the rocket and I love this stock!  To the moon!

Aphria/Tilray Merger Arbitrage Opportunity, Plus APHA vs. CGC
Well my fellow degens, I have an interesting one for you. Aphria (  $APHA  ) and Tilray (  $TLRY  ) are merging to create the world‚Äôs biggest cannabis company. Close to 1B (874M to be exact) in annualized revenues which will only grow.  Anyways the merger states:  ‚ÄúUnder the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the ‚ÄúAphria Shareholders‚Äù)   will receive   shares (the ‚ÄúExchange Ratio‚Äù) of Tilray for each Aphria common share   (each, an ‚ÄúAphria Share‚Äù), while holders of Tilray shares (the ‚ÄúTilray Stockholders‚Äù) will continue to hold their Tilray shares (the ‚ÄúTilray Shares‚Äù) with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares.‚Äù    This means Aphria should be trading at   .8381   of Tilray‚Äôs share price. Tilray is at $  x .8381 =   $   . Aphria should be trading at   $   , yet it‚Äôs only at   $    That‚Äôs a whopping   34%   difference.  Considering Aphria is the stronger company and controls 62% of the combined company, it‚Äôs very rare for it to be trading so far away from the merger ratio. I‚Äôve never seen a merger discrepancy like this before. If anything, Aphria should have the premium. Also, Tilray has high short interest so I doubt it will dip as shorts have to cover, it's most likely Aphria should catch up to Tilray's level.    Aphria/Tilray vs. CGC    Now let‚Äôs compare Aphria/Tilray to Canopy Growth. Canopy did 135M revenue last quarter which is approximately 540M annualized revenue along with a 96M net loss and a whopping adj. EBITDA loss of negative 85M. Furthermore, Canopy has -190M free cash flow, (   Aphria did   revenue with Adj EBITDA of   This will only increase as their next financials will have SweetWater Brewing on them.    Aphria expected to potentially be cash flow positive either this Q or next. ‚ÄúAnd we continue to work to be free cash flow positive in Q3, all subject to the intensity of COVID-19 restrictions in the markets where we operate. ‚Äú  Canopy is valued at     USD  . Aphria/Tilray will be close to 1B annualized revenue, is EBITDA positive, and is valued at only   and   respectively. Not necessarily hating on CGC, the backing from Constellation is definitely solid, but when comparing the two Aphria should be valued higher.  Aphria leads Canada in market share ahead of CGC:     Aphria also has a solid presence in the United States thanks to their EBITDA positive craft beer company, SweetWater who sells  .  Lastly, the   gov could act on some sort of cannabis legislature soon:        TL;DR:   Aphria should be trading 34  % higher   than its current SP due to the .8381 merger ratio with Tilray.  If you are interested in cannabis, I believe there is much better value in Aphria/Tilray compared to CGC.  Disclaimer: Not a financial advisor, not buy/sell advice, cannabis stocks are volatile. Do your own DD.   I wish everyone amazing success in their investing endeavors.

GME   Set Sell Limit In Your Account To Prevent Your Broker From Loaning Out Your Shares to Shorters
Friendly, reminder to set high sell limits in your account.  If you don't your shares can be loaned out to shorts for short ladder attack.  Make sure you check that the sell limits order was not cancelled or rejected.  I set mine to 600/share and was rejected.  I had to come back to the page to make sure it wasn't cancelled or rejected. The only level that worked was $500/share for the specific date of like 2 months from now.  This is how they are gaming the system to help the shorts and fucking you over.  Do it and tell 2 friends and tell those friends to tell 2 friends.     Note:     If you folks do nothing, kiss your money goodbye as they hammer the price lower and soft hands panic sell.

Weedmaps, is the future Shopify of cannabis and potential multibagger
(Read the article for more, I'm too lazy) With the Democratic sweep, impending national cannabis legalization turbocharges this already sexy investment. More legal states = more cannabis retailers to list on Weedmaps = more revenue. Even better? I see a future where consumers buy their cannabis from local retailers in their state online via Weedmaps. The company is already profitable and has high brand equity with those who smoke the ganja. I posted about this SPAC around two months ago at $14 and it has since reached a peak of $26. At $20 where it currently stands, this a great time to jump in before the merge/ticker switches to $WEED. I see this stock reaching $50 before this Summer. Can't buy options, so I'm long 2,000 shares or you can buy the warrants.
I'm Holding Because I Put Down What I Could Lose
I currently own 30 shares @ $214.  This is money that I was okay losing from the beginning.  It certainly wasn't fuck-you money but it was money I was willing to part with.  Don't fucking invest money that you need for bare necessities.  I'm writing this as a warning to you fucks.  I am not selling.  I am HOLDING.  If you aren't okay with the potential of seeing your money gone, don't fucking toss it into the government's casino.  That is all.  I'm HOLDING to $0 if I have to.  This was never about the money - it was always about getting a fairer shake in this country.  Money's nice but a fairer world for all is really what I want.  Buy and hold apes.  Do your own DD, and for fuck's sake, live your life.  This money may be in for a long while.  Take a WSB break if you need to but do not sell.  Selling = loss of any potential to make it big.  This is not financial advice, I am a broke ass ape with a computer.

No FUD, discuss outlets claiming GME now at 38% short and today‚Äôs short ladder dip and rise
I see a lot of people still talking about 120% short position report from Jan 15, however we are now Feb 2nd and I see reports from multiple sources that short percentage of GME is now high 30% or low 40%.  Couple this with the ladder attacks, including today‚Äôs where it dropped to almost $80 at open and then popped up to $150.  Is it not possible that shorts have been covering during the short ladder bottoms and popping it back up (today‚Äôs especially) to cover and then re-shorting the stock to profit as it drops?  Just thinking aloud and would like to discuss this. I am still holding 50 GME @ $140 and 40 AMC @        üèªü§öüèª

Has anyone done the math? Short position vs interest cost?
Any fellow smooth-brains ask their wives' boyfriend to do the math on what the HF's are losing in interest and how it correlates to the price of the stock?  As I understand it, if a company sold a share for 100 bucks that they borrowed for 6 months from their 'buddy' for $5 in interest doesn't expire.  If I was a HF, I'd be thinking:  There's a specific market price at which I'm willing to close my short positions.  Let's call the delta between what they sold the borrowed stock at and what they had to rebuy it at: X.  There's also a known interest fee for borrowing those shares.  Let's call that Y.  So long as Y remains lower than X, can't they just continue to pay the interest fee?  What am I missing here?

Why holding GME will cause $rope to gamma squeeze
Since my last comments got buried, I figured I‚Äôd do my autists who haven‚Äôt gone full qanon a favor and paint you the bigger picture of how this shit will go down. It‚Äôs long so strap in kiddos.    The squeeze is over. It‚Äôs happened. It happened on Wednesday into Thursday when it hit the intraday high of 483. This squeeze was when we fucked over Melvin to the tune of 50% of their portfolio who were shorting at a fucking ridiculous $3 entry. We did it. We won.    Now where you retards went wrong is you failed to realize that there was a whole new flood of shorts at $400. This is why short interest (more on short interest later) stayed at roughly 60m shares short which is where you get your divine 110% short number.    This is when all hell broke loose and wall st. did their usual fuck the retails and the poors tactic, and guess what. It worked. It went from intraday highs of $483 down into the 200s for a lot of Thursday and Friday. THIS IS WHEN THEY COVERED. Let‚Äôs get one thing straight. Wsb‚Äôs greatest advantage AND weakness is diamond handing. You either hold to become DFV or you hold to become the guy who lost 500k on luckin coffee. HFs don‚Äôt give a shit about diamond handing. They drool over .001% alpha on volume trading so no fucking shit they‚Äôre going to cover from 400 to 200.    So now the short interest sits at roughly 50%, but probably closer to 30% when you take into account various hedges. It means these new shorts fucked you all to the tune of over 6b when they covered. Daily interest rates are a fucking joke when they‚Äôve made their profits already. The remaining shares short are their yolos.    Now here‚Äôs where you retards really fucked up. You keep expecting the same short squeeze potential when we first squoze. That pressure was legitimate as Melvin was sitting on shorts initiated at $3. Every move upwards fucked them hard. Anyone who‚Äôs held ITM options knows the joy of high delta. But you retards don‚Äôt realize that these new shorts are initiated at $400. HOW THE FUCK IS RETAIL GOING TO PUSH THIS TO 400 WITHOUT A SQUEEZE? The only reason it got there was the squeeze from the $3 short. Diamond handing at these levels does fucking zero. You fucks need to purchase at 400 - then push beyond that to 500-600 to put any sort of pressure on these new shorts. Diamond handing does literally NOTHING because they‚Äôre under no pressure besides laughable interest rates.    In a way, it‚Äôs actually beautiful. You‚Äôre all holding OTM options with a delta of .005 with zero catalysts and zero hope for a squeeze. It‚Äôs wsb at its finest. At this point, aside from the automated ladder attacks, you‚Äôre all just bidding against each other and there‚Äôs not enough momentum to turn the tide. One last time for you dense motherfuckers out there - diamond handing does not pressure these new shorts. You need to buy to $350+ and then buy again at those levels. Buying dips does jack shit.    Now, a quick primer on short interest. The only reliable info on short interest is the SEC report that comes out every 15 days. There are a stupid number of outlets reporting 15 day old (all melvin) figures. Which brings us to the slimy fucks at S3. Yes they have citron-like marketing, but it‚Äôs the only publicly available model for short interest. They showed that during wed/thurs, short interest was still at 110%. The problem was that you yards thought it was Melvin instead of the new shorts. They then updated again to show that short interest was now down to 50% levels or 30% if you take into the hedges I mentioned earlier. You can reeeeee all you want, and accuse them of being shills, but just take a look at this price action. Is it possible they‚Äôre lying out of their teeth? Sure. But It‚Äôs pretty fucking clear what is taking place so just fucking Occam‚Äôs razor it you tards. You‚Äôre all bagholding for ‚Äúideals‚Äù and ‚Äújustice‚Äù. If you all want to sacrifice your money to these   fucks out of your unwavering sense of virtue, be my guest. Just post some loss porn for the rest of us.    Throwaway account from the martymoho micron days because you fucks are all a mix of Bernie bros who want to take down capitalism and qanon trump supporters who can‚Äôt believe they lost the election. Fuck you all very much.

First time seeing green in my portfolio in a year. Thanks GME
Mark Cuban basically said the squeeze has not been   NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!! (This is more than half of all my life savings.)
Why I will continue to    GME- This one is for the noobs and true smooth brains.
There are 2 types of people that LOVE to give their opinions in money/finance/investing.   Type 1- Poor people who think they‚Äôre smarter than you. These people love to give unsolicited advice and you shouldn‚Äôt listen to these people, well because they‚Äôre poor.  If that reasoning isn‚Äôt good enough, I want you to answer these questions.   Would you ask someone who is obese how to lose weight?  Would you ask someone who has filed for bankruptcy how to get out of debt?  Type 2- People who have had great success with money in their life, such as Mark Cuban. These people don‚Äôt just offer advice, but are happy to answer.   Now mark gave us all some damned good advice today in his AMA. For the people who missed it, HE SAID HE WOULD HOLD.   Mark knows what it takes to be successful. Listen to him, rather than your friends that are worth nothing.   GME TO THE FUCKING MOON      This is not financial advice, I am retarded and I really like the stock.

ROBINHOOD FREEZES STOCK AS SOON AS SHORT LADDER ATTACKS FAIL
Hey fellow diamond hands, I've been following this group of autists for about three weeks now and I never expected all this craziness to happen when I joined on whim just to check it out. Now I'm in pretty deep and been following the story relentlessly.  Robinhood replaced restrictions on the stock RIGHT AS THE SHORT LADDER ATTACKS STOPPED. They seem to only place restrictions on trade when it goes up, never when it plummets. They're trying everything to freeze the price or lower it at any cost to stop its momentum. Robinhood restricting last Thursday could've been a fluke in market manipulation since they were completely broke and literally couldn't afford to buy anymore stock. But THIS, THIS IS BLATANT MARKET MANIPULATION WITH NO ROOM FOR SPECULATION. They now have  funding as seen in their stupid ass tweets and the correlation between NYSE stopping short ladder attacks and them placing a max cap on how many GME stocks can possibly buy is just TOO MUCH! They're doing everything in their power to stop this stock and it's actually scaring me a little. If they can pull this illegal crap with no punishment, I've completely lost faith in our free market. I've already filed a complaint to the SEC about this issue and I hope you guys do the same. This war is far from over.  (Edit): I know that exchanges freeze stocks not brokers. Robinhood is contributing to the price stagnation right now (a price freeze in my mind) by putting restrictions on how much you can buy yet again.
GME just added to NYSE short sale restriction list
The short ladder attacks are coming to an end my fellow retards!     The sun is beginning to rise over the battlefield and the hedgies will soon have to collect their dead and wounded and retreat back to their hidey holes from which they came. For those of you still holding stay strong! Even if they win a battle or two they will not win the war.

Exercise Options.
I know a lot of you have been cranking off to the glorious loss porn. Me too. Hedge Funds and short sell sellers are trying every single trick in the book to get us to sell. The solution to this is exercise your GME /AMC options if the capital is available. This will only further the squeeze and increase the WSB pressure on the Hedge Fund short sellers.    #Diamond Hands + #Sticky feet + #Vibranium balls  =  #Tendies  What do I know though? Just a fellow smooth brained ape here. This isn‚Äôt financial advice.
Didn't have much to spare but when I saw the price this morning, I had to buy.
I wont sell! APES TOGETHER STRONGER
Deleted earlier post with better picture. I'm not selling.
its all i could spare, but it's enough to make the hedgies screech! to the moon we go!
Hold the fucking line. We got this!
Still holding here in Norway. Diamonds are forged under pressure.
Switch to a not meme brokerage.
I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice.  Per Cuban's AMA I agree strongly that Robinhood's buying restrictions have hurt the momentum. They are going to have the same liquidity issue again and again as the price is driven up. It's a deadlock.  Fidelity and Vanguard have access to assets that make RH look like an ant in comparison and they will have no problem backing you up.  > BuT i DoNt WaNt To PaY fEeS tO tRaDe  Shut the fuck up. A free brokerage was too good to be true and WSB should have known better. But we didn't. And now we're paying the price of being reliant on an institution which can't or won't support us. It doesn't matter  why  this happened, it did and it will again.  Open a Fidelity account and wire money into it. You could be up an running in a day or two. BTFD and hold. This is a prolonged war on an unimaginably powerful and resourceful institution. It was never going to be all sunshine and rainbows with a victory parade after. It's going to take weeks and it's going to be hard. Think of today not as the end, but as a lost battle where we now know we need to make a strategic retreat. The war is not over.  200 shares and holding.  edit: Hold the shares you do have in RH. I don't foresee problems selling them (150 of my shares are there so I hope to hell we won't), and it could take 2 weeks to move them. You don't want your shares inaccessible for 2 weeks.  edit2: Fidelity is free for trading shares, you only pay a small fee to trade options.
Even YAHOO FINANCE knows what's up. Recommend to HOLD. So you know what will I do then.
Saw   mil profit and said nah. I‚Äôm not fucking selling. 10,000/share or bust.
Threw 2 Grand in at The Dip. Let's get this! HOLD
Doing my part. Did Melvin really completely exit all their shorts? Are they trying to make the 3 billion back by shorting these again? Is the squeeze squoze? I dont know any of these things. Buy buy buy
Theory vs Practice
Not a bot trying to get anyone to sell or take another position, just a smooth brained autist with a thought...   So, what we've all seen over the last two weeks is the short squeeze "theory" at play. We watched the shorts try to cover, the price came up as it should, the massive buy frenzy, and we're holding. The mechanics of the market at play, and in a truly free market, things were working as everyone theorized they should. Now comes the practice of stopping our ability to buy, gamma squeezes, ladder attacks, etc. The point is, whatever we think "should" happen, can be defeated by the simple fact that we're playing this game on someone else's field, and its their ball.   The theory is that they will have to cover at some point, but do they have to do it in the way we all expect? The evidence shows they do not right now. They have so much power they can get away with dirty tactics to cover their asses. It seems like what "should" happen, isn't going to because    this isn't a fair fight   .     Cuban says he would hold, so we hold. DFV looks like he's gonna hold, so we hold. We hold because we want to on our own volition. I'm not selling, and I'm not backing down.     But, maybe its time we shift our perspective from "buy whatever we can and hold, because they have to cover" to getting down and dirty and fighting them with their own tactics... what that means? I don't know I'm just a retard with a drool bib. We've gone from an active position of being able to buy the momentum and rally, to a passive one. Yes it has been forced on us due to the buy limits and price manipulation, but we can't let that stop us. Lawsuits don't matter, its cheaper to pay fines and settle than go bankrupt. What can we even do? Are we stuck buying and holding? I mean I'm in, I can handle the pressure, but most people bought in really high and are about to lose everything again if things don't work out in our favor. I'm not running scared, I'm a realist the price HAS to come down and stay down at some point. Is now that point? Even if it spikes hard and we see the moon fly by on our warp speed trajectory to infinity, they will chop our knees out from under us to stop that from happening.   I guess what I'm trying to say, we might have to pivot our strategy and play dirty to actually win this. I'm not advocating anything illegal. This is not investment advice. I am literally retarded as you can all see by the fact I wrote this out and submitted it. Good luck and I'll see you all in tendy town.

The psychology of having Diamond Hands
Sup retards. You're reading this which means one of two things. You either think you have Diamond hands, and want to know how that happened, or two, you're afraid your hands may be turning into paper and want to know how to stop it from happening. Luckily I'm here to provide some non-investment related advice that you can apply to all facets of your life.  Some smart people a long time ago did a study of some kids. They put a cookie in front of the kids and said "if you don't eat the cookie, I'll give you another cookie at the end." Then they left the room. Know what happened? Some kids ate the cookie, some kids didn't. Stocks are cookies we own, in a way. And if we hold onto them and don't eat the cookie now, we get more cookies later.  So what was the difference between the kids who ate the cookie now, and the kids who got all the cookies later? Some kids would stare at the cookie. watch it, Obsess over it like it was their fucking Precious. They would hold the cookie, turn it over and look at the other side, maybe lick the cookie. Their world became the cookie for the duration of that experiment.  Other kids distracted themselves. Hid the cookie under the plate, played games with their hands, some kids took a nap.  Guess which kids ate the cookie before the time was up? That's right, the kids who just watched the cookie the whole damn time. Those kids worked soo hard to have diamond hands, and fucked it up for themselves. The other kids took a break and relaxed and got the extra cookies in the end.  What can you learn from this? Out of sight, out of mind. If you really need to have diamond hands and you're not sure if you can do it, take a break. Unplug. And I really mean distract yourself fully. Disengage. When you're done upvoting this shit close reddit and go for a walk. Don't just stop staring at the ticker, I mean really move your brain onto another topic. If it helps, set a 2-hour timer and only check in 2-hour increments.  It's the minute-to-minute drama your mind will be weak to. It caused me to paper hand at the worst possible minute last Thursday. Of course I got right back in when I could though. But if I had taken a shit or something instead of getting obsessed with watching the line go up and down, I'd be much richer than I am right now.  So learn something from those kids, retards. And have diamond-hands by not even trying. Success is inevitable.    Edit: TL;DR:    Smart kids stop staring at the cookie, ended up getting another cookie. Dumb kids obsessed over the ticker all day and paper-handed when things got too scary.

$AMZN holding for earnings 2 calls Feb 19th $3140

Wanting to know if these will print tendies
I know it's not much but every one counts
Have FUN you retarded üêµ's! Think longer term, pay what YOU believe to be a fair price to watch the show and buy AT GameStop.
Did another post on this but realized that there are core questions that need to be emphasized...     # To win this battle we have to think LONGER TERM here:  HFs can afford to carry their shorts for MONTHS before it becomes truly unprofitable for them. But they are still paying to be in that position. You on the other hand can carry your shares TIL THE DAY YOU DIE and you will get dividends for doing so.   I know most of you have never seen a floppy disk or tube television in your life but let me tell you something. LET TIME DO THE WORK FOR YOU.     # Think less like a trader and more like a SHAREHOLDER:  Instant gratification is great but know what else is great? A big fucking I TOLD YOU SO down the line.  Buy the stock. Buy at GameStop. Help their earnings. Arguably you are doing more of a favor to the endgame of this by buying   at   GameStop than buying   GameStock  . Hold the stock like a boomer because while valuations might tell you it is overpriced, fact is that the shorts push valuation UP because in the end they are BUYERS of the stock at some point, and see #1 about time working in your favor...  Go to a boomer mindset. It is the right tool for the job.  #   # If you cannot have fun watching the whole thing. You probably have too much money on the line...  Kinda obvious ain't it? But here is my advice... if you can't handle the heat. Don't put any more money into it. If you still can't handle it. Be humble and accept that this is not healthy for you and exit at a loss. Mind you, that selling low and buying high is a motto for a reason.   Go out (to your yard because pandemic), make some love with your hand, go out and then make love with your hands. The possibilities are endless. There is a world out there outside the stock market you know. Just   üèª by default by not looking at your portfolio all day. Set a limit order on pluto if you must to feel at ease. I know I do.  And even if you are not comfortable with buying GME now. Even if you paperhands don't allow you to be in peace with your position. At least go on to spend some of what you liquidate on a GameStop store near you. And then let's watch Q1 numbers rolling in together!

IFF - Update - Great short Squeeze opportunity.
Hey you guys - Sloth  Just wanted to give you an update on the IFF Short and gamma squeeze opportunity I brought to WSB yesterday.  It is great news! The cost to borrow shares continues  rocket upwards ( , and they continue to use borrowed shares to try and keep down the price.     There is a good options ladder this week (at $135 and $150), and there is a monstrous option gamma squeeze at $150 for Feb 19.  This is also a very valuable company, which will see significant growth in their price to sales multiple, now that their acquisition of DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences is complete.  Here is the Ortex data, showing the current number of borrowed (short) shares is at 61m:    And yes, I own a position in this stock. This is not investment advice, and all that other stuff. Do your own DD, and please, tell me why I am wrong.

Geely (GELYY) already designs, produces and sells EV and other cars all around the world. While a lot of this is priced in, they are profitable and they have spare capacity in their factories. Also, their PE Ratio is only   meaning there is a lot of room to grow.

Quick disclaimer, I have no concrete info to back this up, just a series of questions I want RH and Citadel to answer.  I do not believe Citadel ever "told" RH to stop trading.  That would be so flagrantly illegal that if anything ever came out about it people would actually go to jail.  These people are smart enough to know how to skirt the law so something like that never even comes into play.  I also don't believe they ever had to tell RH to do anything, because they were well aware what to expect.  What do we know about RH and Citadel?  Citadel buys more information from RH than any other customer.  They're also an investor.  I'm not sure exactly what data they purchase/are privy to, but I cannot imagine it does not include a potential liquidity crisis should certain events in the market take place.  Remember how u/DeepFuckingValue was telling us to be aware of increased short activity back in early December as it would be an attempt to drive the share price down?  Are we supposed to believe that some of the most sophisticated financial institutions on Earth did not notice something and start making contingency plans?  Here's what I want to know from Robinhood, preferably in a situation where they're under oath:  1. At what point were they aware of a potential liquidity crisis? 2. What steps did they take to increase deposits on hand once they started to see user movement towards heavily shorted stocks on their platform? 3. Who is in charge of their risk management strategy?  Where was this person during the past few months?    And finally, the most important question:      4) At what point was Citadel informed that Robinhood      might      be required to limit buys of GME due to liquidity requirements if events unfolded a certain way      TLDR:   I don't think Citadel ever had to tell RH to do anything because they already knew what was coming.
I want to hold, but my hands are wavering.

Hedge funds are probably confused on why we don‚Äôt sell when it‚Äôs low and instead buy more. WE ARE RETARDED. I literally have my CAR in GameStop and I don‚Äôt fucking care. Please, bring it to $50, I‚Äôve been meaning to get my average price down even more. At the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt cost me anything to hold. It costs them hefty interest and they have to go home every night to their ugly wives and explain why their fund is down billions everyday. I must be a bad car salesman because I‚Äôm not selling shit

Hedge funds are getting crushed by the worst short squeeze in a quarter century
Understanding Short Interest: The most important post you will downvote all day.
# Short-interest ratio is:    the number of shares sold short (short interest) divided by average daily volume.   This is often called the "days-to-cover ratio" because it determines, based on the stock's average trading volume, how many days it will take short sellers to cover their positions   IF THE PRICE GOES UP    # EILI5    a stock has a short interest of 4 shares   average daily volume of shares traded is 20   20/4 = 5 this would mean 5 days to cover     # What is Short Selling?       Short selling is the opposite of buying stocks.   It's the selling of a security that the seller does not own, done in the hope that the price will fall.   You can borrow the stock from your broker-dealer, sell it and get the proceeds from the sale.     If the stock price declines, you can close out the position by buying the stock on the open market at the lower price and returning the stock to your broker. Since you paid less for the stock you returned to the broker than you received selling the originally borrowed stock, you¬†realize a gain.    #   Bingo  What was the price of $GME last week? It was over $200, over $300, over $400   is the price of $GME now ? $117 and as low as $74.  # If I opened a short position at $300, and closed it out at $  the very bottom of the   the price goes up a bit because lots of shorts closed for a   sold to all of you who thought you were "buying the dip"  Based on Reddit Logic, it's impossible for any other person or company to have shorted the stock after it went above $200. Of course they did, that is an absolutely ridiculous price. Everyone knows what happens AFTER a short   at the VW chart. It's easy to understand that a $300 price of GME wouldn't last that long, so if you short it at $  would you close your positions now when it will continue to drop? More it drops more you make.      You all keep going back to the thought that Melvin who shorted at 4, 5, 10 dollars a   not covered. What do you think happened when the stock went up 400% last week????

Why I‚Äôm holding $GME
I know everyone has their reasons but I wanted to give mine. My family was devastated by 2008 and we lost our house my dad lost his job. Fast forward I have 40k in student loan debt, and this BANG play got me up to 44k at one point but I couldn‚Äôt sell it. My brothers and I were having too much fun, and the community that has come and interacted with old head wsber‚Äôs is fucking magical. I‚Äôve been lurking here for years and years I‚Äôve seen beautiful and tragic things happen on this subreddit, and I‚Äôve always wanted to be a part of it. Now I‚Äôm part of the biggest thing to happen here ever, and I‚Äôm so jazzed. Seeing the dirty nonsense on the other side has only hardened my resolve. My mom may not live to see this thing play out, but I want to make her proud.  ü§≤üèº go to the üåïand beyond!!!! Moreover I‚Äôd like to hear more stories of why y‚Äôall are holding? Especially the international crowd cause y‚Äôall are killing it!

$GME - At this point you have 3 options
Edit: I forgot to share my new WSB logo with you all!        You really only have 3 options at this point:  1. Make money 2. Make a ton of money 3. Lose money  So how do these 3 come into play?  1. HOLD.  If you hold the shares you currently have, we will climb back up and you will have your tendies.  The squeeze is coming.  The hedgies are beyond fuk right now.  Hold, and sell at $10k.  This was always the plan and still is. 2. HOLD and AVERAGE DOWN.  You already know you're going to make money because the hedgies are fuk.  Want to make more?  Lower your cost basis!  If you bought in at $300, right now the stock is cheap as hell.  If you bought 10 @ $300, and buy another 20 @ $120, your cost basis has now dropped to $180.  In addition, you have now have 30 stocks in total, further fuk'ing the hedgies.  This is the smart play.  The people who will be driving Teslas to Valhalla dripping dip sauce all over themselves while eating tendies are doing this. 3. Be a paperhanded bitch and sell cuz you're scared.  You lose money and have no hope of profiting off the hedgies being fuk.  You lose a ton of karma and WSB calls you a poonanny for the rest of your life.  You will eventually see the massive amounts of profit everyone else takes and you will cry.  Your wife's boyfriend won't even let you smell his taint anymore.  The choice is yours.  I'm in it to further fuk hegdies, make tendies, and aspire to be DFV.  I'll take option 2.

Checkmate wall street!
TLDR; Checkmate to the hedge funds    Alright retards, listen up. Move your shares from your broker to direct registration. This puts the stock in YOUR name and not your brokerage (this is the electronic equivalent of a physical stock certificate).   Meaning it will FORCE them to secure a REAL share. If our theories about the ladder attacks and naked shorts are true (significant counterfeit shares), the  hedge funds will have a DEFINITE date that they will no longer be able to cover (3-21 days depending on how / when enough shares get moved over), even with the bullshit tricks up their sleeve. And when that happens.... fuck the moon, we're going to a new fucking dimension!  Someone tell me I'm wrong. Until then, fucking   HOLD  .      How to move your shares:    It should be as simple as phoning up your brokerage and having them move the shares to DRS. They will have all the info needed as long as your account is up to date.  After that, you simply need to sign up with the registered transfer agent for GME, which is found here:    I contacted both Fidelity and the transfer agent (  and verified all of this. The transfer agent will offer the same trading services as a brokerage, except they aren't pooling our shares together and you have COMPLETE control over how your share is used. This account would be only for GME.   In reality once the % of float was moved over we'd start seeing the effects. I'm sure someone better at math than me could figure out the exact % needed.  Am retard. Not fin adviser. Additional DD on this subject in my profile.  Edit:   More info on DRS "DRS provides investors with an alternative to holding their securities in certificate or ‚Äústreet‚Äù form. Under DRS, investors can elect to have their securities registered directly on the issuer‚Äôs records in book-entry form. With DRS, the investor does not receive a physical certificate, instead receiving periodic account statements (at least yearly) from the transfer agent or issuer evidencing holdings. Dividend/interest payments, proxy materials, annual reports, etc., are mailed from the issuer or its transfer agent directly to the investor."

Lesson for GME Braveheart Holders: FAANG stonk grooming vs. Wolf of WallSt p&d
This might be the first pmp-n-dmp these WSB guys have experienced.  They‚Äôre used to FAANG stuff only going up for years on end.     The GME difference from dotcom boom?  These traders think they are fighting evil.  Don‚Äôt give up! Like Braveheart.  This is dangerous emotional trading that can lead to hold the bag to GME $0.     Yes, it may go to $0.    That's why we're all here.  Sure, HF's were stupid to short GME at $5,  but yes, the dumb shorts were right, GME has stores in malls.     Dur dur.  Steam means download games     Now that WSB'ers are underwater, they get to play mental anguish of "Take losses or hold bag?"  Hope and pray is not a plan.  Stock may never get back to $200.   The stock does not care that you bought at $200.  Insane options will expire worthless and 100% loss on those trades.     Thin power of masses will save things?  Enron had millions of people supporting it.     Hold or sell.  Does not affect anyone buy you.  Do whatever you want, obviously.     This will be a good lesson for new traders.  The lesson for new guys is to have a plan.  Exit plan, not just entry plan.  Learn to cut losses. RULE #1     I am not an adviser.  I have no money in the market.

ICLN: What‚Äôs behind the $10M options play
I bought to open 611 Jan 23 call options on ICLN at $45 today at $  at a cost of around $350k. This was part of 6198 options already exchanged today and 19,261 contracts bought since Friday.   iShares Global Clean Energy ETF is the largest clean energy ETF and has the most liquid options market of any of the ESG funds. Jan 2023 began trading last Monday, and July 2021 and Jan 2022 have also seen tens of thousands of contracts traded almost entirely at highest strike price available ($45) in recent days.   Why? IMO These options are hella cheap with IV around 50% on an ETF that has QUADRUPLED (from low of $8) in past year with top holding (PLUG) up 1800%+ in past year.   If ICLN ‚Äúonly‚Äù doubles to $60 in next year and IV reverts to historical mean of ~80%, $  options @45 would be worth at least $20 with still a year left to expiry.   And this $10M is really nothing compared to Trillions in capital already deployed by the US, China, and Europe as part of economic stimulus plans all centered around clean energy (the US joined this wave with Biden‚Äôs plan). TRILLIONS in direct subsidies in conjunction with TRILLIONS in quantitative easing by the Fed and other central banks. As just one example, PLUG has completed two secondary offerings in past few months to capitalize on stock price and raise billions to build 5 hydrogen plants, 2 operational next year.   So in summary while the focus has been on GME etc in recent days, over 10 million dollars was quietly invested knowing TRILLIONS in Stimulus + TRILLIONS in Cheap Money could make for very nice returns.
WSB is being short attacked by hedgies. All of our favourites are under attack and tripped SSR today. This isn't a coincidence.
It's my opinion that these hedgies didn't liquidate long positions in order to cover shorts just yet, but instead to short all of our favourites in order to pay for the impending squeeze and recoup losses.  Look at AMC, BB, NOK, PLTR, etc. All of them were shorted hard and fast this morning, and once SSR was tripped they setup sell pressure walls to hold that price until they can short into the bid again.  Overcoming this wall requires a lot of buy volume that just isn't there right now, we're spread to thin.   Remember that SSR is tripped when shorted beyond 10%, and for the remainder of that trading day and the following trading day the shorter's can only sell above the strike. This is also known as the uptick rule.   It's almost as if there was some kind of backroom meeting to coordinate an effort to short our most mentioned and beloved tickers. A lot of these hedge funds would have shorted BlackBerry when it was at $10, so why wouldn't they liquidate positions in their longs and short it when it is at 22? For those unaware, shorter's make money by keeping the difference between the strike they sold the borrowed chair at and the strike they purchase it back at minus of course fees and interest. Allowing them to push this stuff down is making them money.   There's strength in unity, let's stop fighting them on 5 fronts, and make them come to us on one. GME        Position, handful of shares in GME.  I'm not an advisor, this is solely my opinion.
You don‚Äôt lose if you d-don‚Äôt sell
Don't be a paper hand, if i can hold you can hold
Dont buy Silver. Stay with GME.
Alright fellow Monkeys listen here. I found a great quote on   that summarizes how fucked the shorts are going to be.  "Here‚Äôs An Example Of How To Short A Stock  For example, let‚Äôs say ABC stock is currently trading at $10. After doing your research and due diligence (DD) you think that ABC stock could fall to $5 a share. You will then contact your broker, and your broker will lend you shares of ABC stock that you will then sell in the open market. In this example, let‚Äôs say you short 10 shares of stock.¬†  So, after selling those 10 borrowed shares of stock, you now have net positive $100 cash in your account. Next, ABC stock drops to $5 a share the following week. You will then do what‚Äôs called ‚Äúcover your short position‚Äù by buying the stock back. In this case, you buy back at $5. Lastly, you will pay your lender back the shares you borrowed and profit the difference. So with 10 shares as the example, you, as the investor, would profit $50 shorting ABC stock from $10 to $5 a share.¬†  It‚Äôs crucial to note that, despite some investors having made their fortunes by short selling, it‚Äôs considered a high-risk investment strategy. The reason being is because short selling has infinite risk. In simpler terms, the amount you can lose by shorting a stock is unlimited."  What we are seeing today is the HFs trying lower the price of GME in order to scare retail investors. They squeeze has not been squoze.  (insert a lot of rocket emojis, diamond hands and all that.)  I am a degenerate and this is no investment advice. Do your own DD and don't spam me. I increased my GME position today at 80$. But what do I know? I just buy GME and today it was cheeper than yesterday.  EDIT 1: If you want to check my source feel free! According to   the two most shorted stocks to watch are #1 GME and #2 AMC.

Can you stomach the sight of your portfolio being in red for a couple days before it squeezes? Do you have the strength to hold while things are going down? These are the facts: the shorts still have millions of shares to cover, and as long as we buy, hold, and do nothing, then we will win. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Winning has never been so easy. All you need to do is hold. No matter what the price is. It‚Äôs that easy people.

It‚Äôs Time to Fight in the Mud
Can‚Äôt you autists see? The game has changed.  Hedge funds seem to think that driving the price down is in their best interest,   it is not.   Here is why.  A short squeeze results from a low availability of shares. The price of the share does not necessarily matter for a short squeeze, and it does not effect the magnitude of an infinity squeeze.  Hedge funds need a lot of shares, and they do not want to buy them for a lot of money. They do, however, have a lot of money. Hedge funds believe that it is in their best interest to drive the price down and scare other out because they are way too over leveraged.   But the price decreasing is actually not in their best interest    Driving the price down allows retail investors to maximize their ability to hold shares. Once the amount of free floating shares is too low, hedge funds panic much like the VW short squeeze. For the price of one share on Friday (~$330) you could have purchased 4 shares today (~$82). Hedge funds can outpace us when shares cost a lot of money, but we can fight back when they are cheap.  Furthermore, allowing hedge funds to drive the price down can trigger the short sell rule which restricts their ability to drive the price down further. Let them drive the price down, let them trigger that rule and then load up.  Slowly the resources will be out of reach for the hedge funds, and they will have no choice but to cover. That is when you get to name your price, everything in between is just for show.  I am not a financial advisor, nor a professional by any means. All information and discussion in this post is purely speculative and hypothetical. I am retarded. I own GME shares.    Start fighting hedge funds with their own tactics, it‚Äôs time to fight in the mud

Don't be this guy - a glimpse into the future
Close your eyes. It's Friday, the sun is peaking through the curtains and you're eating your Weetabix with no worries on your mind. You're content.  You sold your GME shares at small loss at the start of the week as you continued to watch the share price plummet due to market manipulation. You got out, you survived.   It's 9:28am, you're returning from the school run. Your BMW 1 series seats make you feel safe and important. Your house, although small, is affordable and the mortgage repayments don't put too much pressure on your paper wallet.    Your phone goes off as you enter the house. You sit on the sofa and turn on NBC as you open Whatsapp. You have 17 unread messages.    Your eyes pan up, the news anchor is shouting. You read the title at the bottom of the screen - 'The Short Squeeze Is Happening". Jim Cramer is crying. You quickly open your Whatsapp group chat and only see dollar signs being spammed by your friends. You open Yahoo Finance and see the share price at  , it's still rising. Your heart skips a beat. You open I-phone calculator and work out that your 17 shares would now be worth just over 10,000 US dollars. You feel sick.   The share price is still rising. You receive a call from your best friend Mickey, he's crying too. He's telling you about how you were right and he'll be able to pay off his student loan soon. Also his wife is pregnant. You congratulate him with a fickle grin and fake laugh. You look back down at your phone,    ,     WallStreetBets has crashed due to the traffic.    You realise everything you stood for is coming true, but you paper handed too soon.   You ignored the threads, the experts. You ignored DeepFuckingValue.   You ignored your god given right to a better life for you and your wifes boyfriend.    You try to buy back in, but you have no money. You begin to laugh, and laugh. Despair and anguish turn into humour.    You pull the Glock from your $16 AliExpress safe and load it. You hold it to your head, you shiver.    You don't pull the trigger. Your paper hands can't do it, and never will be able to do anything of any meaningful value. You drop the gun and admit defeat.    As the camera pans out of your window and over your neighborhood, we see Wall St burning in flames in the distance. The transfer of wealth begins, fade to black.    EDIT: DON'T BE THAT GUY

As a nobody I just wanted to say
I am so proud of each and every one of you other autistic motherfuckers. I don't believe I've ever had so much pride being a faceless drop in a seemingly infinite ocean. I feel a connection to each and every one of you. Every single post has resonated with me, I've looked at all the amazing DD you retards are putting together. I've had my heart warmed by all of the giving back to communities all over the globe. I've tried to console those I personally know who might have doubts and feel they're at an all time low. I thoroughly appreciate the reassurances you suave fuckers have taken the time to write out showing the masses who might be new and feeling kinda     that although we're at a really low point, its not for nothing and that we need to STICK TOGETHER and HOLD FIRM.    GME as it heads to the  MOON  by way of Cybertron.  I doubt this post will be seen by the masses, but for those who do see it - I'm proud of you and what you're doing, this will not soon be forgotten.  -A nobody who is so glad to be a part of something      I'm not a financial advisor and this isn't advice but I sure bought the fucking dip

Theory - the drop yesterday was in part due to institutional monthly rebalancing
Can anyone share their thoughts on the effects of institutional rebalancing?  With the 20x rise in GME in late Jan, wouldn't funds need to sell off GME in order to bring their weighting back down?  I see 3 major players.  The holders, the shorters, and the investment funds.   Wsb isn't selling. Maybe even buying the dip.  The shorters eventually need to cover and will be buying.    So where is all this sell pressure coming from? Could it be from institutional rebalancing?  Looking at whale wisdom and sort by % of portfolio.  That percentage shot up for all these funds by 1/31, and they all hold tens of thousands of shares.   Would these funds be forced to sell off large chunks of shares to bring their % of portfolio back in line with what it was on 12/31?
DID THEY SAY SALE? BROKE COLLEGE STUDENT SAYIN FUCK IT

Nothing to Lose
Preface this with I‚Äôm not a financial advisor in the slightest. I‚Äôm an ape with a banana obsession like the rest of you guys.   At this point in time if you have invested to GME already you have nothing to lose. They‚Äôre gonna ladder the stock to the ground for fear factor. They‚Äôre going to say Silver is hot and GME is not. Don‚Äôt listen. Stay focused, the goal isn‚Äôt to only get rich, it‚Äôs to give a middle finger to these hedge fund owners. You‚Äôre portfolio may be at an all time low, but that‚Äôs a positive if you look at it the right way. The price can hardly go any lower.. so what does that mean? Means the price can only go back up retards! Hold your shares and we can do this!!
It is going to get worse before it gets better.   üèª
Be mentally prepared to see prices dropping and stalling a LOT. We are in the grey zone. You can sense the emotional hit today's drop had but fear not degenerates. We win by default if we just   üèª.  Use the period to set up accounts in brokerages that won't restrict trading. BTFD if you can afford it. We can   üèª this.  Mark Cuban's AMA also put light on one issue: HFs won't want to close their shorts. Their plan is to drag this and leverage their sheer size on us. But we can beat them at their game by buying more and more shares at these lower prices. But don't despair if prices fluctuate under 100, under 80 or even under freaking 30. The more shares we can gobble up, the better.  Just remember:     1. Only risk what you can afford to lose. 2. This can drag on longer than any of us initially believed, so BE PATIENT. If you can't buy more my advice is to just go do something else. Forget about it. Remember rule #1? You only have money you can afford to lose in this, so why the rush? 3. Help out by upvoting good ideas, topics, doing DD, motivating people, being funny and generally entertaining. It all helps. 4. Have some fun. If you cannot have fun you probably have too much money on the line. 5. (Optional) - Instead of a trader's mindset. Adopt a Shareholder's mindset. You own a tiny bit of GameStop now. Go ahead, buy on their stores. Lift their business up and when Q1 numbers come out it will be a great deal of help for them.

Hedge funds/MMs are the OG YOLO retards. DD inside
I will start by saying these parties are so stupid.  Plain and simple.  Just because they wear suits and drink expensive coffee does not make them any smarter than you or I.  The only thing they have is more money.  But lucky for us, as the 69th law of thermodynamics states, GME shares cannot be created or destroyed.  This means no amount of money can destroy GME shares, and no amount of money can create them.  This is ofcourse, unlike the diamond industry which is controlled.  Diamonds can be created in labs and there are far more diamonds in the world than are in circulation.   This means we have unlimited potential for   .  We need to realize that the power to have    is within all of us.  And that we all evolved from üêí (who were here when the first diamonds were being made) into   .  These hedge funds and/or Market makers are infantile compared to our diamond handed evolutionary traits.  They are so dumb that they haven't realized the one simple truth:  We aren't fucking selling.  Let these clowns drive the price lower.  I implore them.  The damage has already been done and at the end of all this they will have doubled down on their short so many times that Gamestop will have to issue a class retard share that these shorts are forced to buy and pay to hold until they can close their original short position or for life.  TL:DR  Diamonds are forever Short positions require interest payments We already won, we're just winning in slow motion.  All they have left is their King with 69 moves left, while we have 420 rooks on the board. GG Melvin, ez clap

RH changes GME restriction to 100 stocks, but you should move away from RH now
Guy claims that GME is bouncing back due to Robinhood lifting the GME restriction. Stock started bouncing back at 10:50 am.  Anyone STILL using RH can confirm that Robinhood lifted the restriction around that period? If so, that definitely confirmed the hypothesis GME is down due to low RH demand(amongst other reasons such as short ladder attack). If you have cash in RH, you need to move all your money into another brokerage now!! There is no guarantee that RH wouldn't pull some BS tactics again in the near future.

EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO $GME
NOT SELLING UNTIL IT REACHES $4,
All "WSB stocks" are being treated the same by the media. They're not the same.
The media has been covering WSB absolutely atrociously. WSB stocks have been rising and falling together for days now, even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons. This has the potential to create some bargains. I wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why. The stocks I'm going to cover are GME, AMC, BB, NOK, and I'll touch on SLV (and why it's not a WSB stock)    GME: The squeezening    GME was trading at $4 a share 6 months ago. People on Wall Street were treating it like it would be the next Blockbuster. The fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete. Hedge funds started heavily shorting it, expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years. Even if it was, 138% short interest is insane. They were asking for a squeeze.   Also Gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer. The pandemic cost them in the short term, but they can survive. Is Macy's going out of business because of online shopping? Maybe eventually, but for now they're trudging along. Gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers, in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar. If you do that with clothes you're a goodwill. In other words:   we like the stock    There was really good news concerning vaccination, so the pandemic sell-off started reversing. As the stock price came back to pre-pandemic levels, Ryan Cohen joined the board (previous CEO of Chewy) there was hope for the future trajectory of the company. This absolutely screwed the short sellers, leading to the short squeeze. Gamestop has become a short squeeze play. It's speculative right now. It won't be worth $500 a year from now, and no one believes that. But it also won't be worth $4 a year from now.     AMC: GME's little brother    AMC has a similar story to GME, except less hope. The cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic, but that doesn't mean that the company is closing imminently. The company became undervalued, and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close, the price started coming back to pre-pandemic levels. Short sellers got caught with their pants down. They got squoze, and lost a ton of money.  AMC is different that GME in that cinema's were having huge problems even before the pandemic. Also unlike GME, there is no e-business guru joining AMC's board. I think GME has hope long term, whereas I am much more skeptical for AMC. The short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term, but long term I'm not sure where it ends up.    BB: Not GME    Blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers, but they have shifted dramatically. At this point, Blackberry is a cybersecurity company:     BB is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology:     And with the solar winds hack, they were listed as a possible beneficiary.   Blackberry has a partnership with Amazon, and has partnerships in China as well. BB is nothing like GME or AMC. It's a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $100 within 5 years or could do nothing.     NOK: Definitely not GME    NOK is similar to BB in that people think of them for their phones, but they... don't do that anymore. NOK is a 5G company now. They have 2 major competitors in Europe, Ericsson and Huawei. Yes, that Huawei. The one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to China. It is likely that Huawei gets regulated out of Europe, which is a gift to Nokia. The company has partnerships with T-Mobile and Google:     Nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock. It's trading at around $  right now. I would be surprised if it didn't hit $  by EOY. But I would be just as surprised if it hit $9. They look to be giving out a consistent dividend, which might bring some big pension accounts on board.     SLV: Not a WSB stock    I think I saw 1 post on SLV here, and suddenly it is a WSB stock in the media. Someone posts here about SLV every once in a while, talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit. SLV is a scam. SLV does not create value. It's a commodity. Institutional investors are all over it. There's no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold. Literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results.   Notice how SLV is the only stock out of all the "WSB stocks" that is not trending together. GME, BB, NOK, and AMC are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different. SLV does it's own shit. I really think this SLV thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling.    ALL THAT SAID    If GME or AMC crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other "WSB stocks" to crash, BB and NOK present huge opportunities. I personally am going all in on NOK if it goes under $4 a share.     TL;DR  : GME and AMC are short term, high risk, high reward short squeeze plays. BB is a longer term, medium risk, high reward play. NOK is a longer term, low risk, medium reward play. FUCK SLV.

Y'all brought meaning to my life again
Obviously            Long-time lurker but decided to post because we need to keep this sub fun and bring positivity!  I've  truly enjoyed this sub over the last few years and at first I came for  the memes (guilty) but stayed for the community. As with most of the  world and especially the US life has been pretty challenging  over the  last year.  For me, that's meant an anxiety and depression cocktail  which not even my wife's boyfriend could help me get out of. I stopped  caring for myself and caring about anything really and although I keep  trying to do my best nothing had been able to get me out of this.  That  changed two weeks ago when my friend and I decided to go in on GME and  just see what happens. I went from checking this sub a few times a week  to pretending to read nearly every quality post and the excitement,  banding together, and support I have seen and felt over the last 2 weeks  have been amazing! It jolted me back into caring at least a little bit  about myself and life. It didn't solve the challenges I face but I feel  more alive than I have in over a year and it has helped me see I can get  out of the dark place I was in with some help and putting in a little  effort each day to change my behaviors.  I  appreciate all of you (Not you paper hands though) and please drink  water, exercise, try and eat healthy, and take time to disconnect once  and a while. Care for the people in your life and any strangers who are  not billionaire hedge fund managers or billionaire wealth hoarders.  GME@97, GME@325, GME@269, GAME@180  AMC@16  This  is not financial advice and is for entertainment only. I cannot read,  do not take advice from me. I am not smart I just like the stock.  Edit: Spelling            for weeks or months if I have to. I ain't leaving!
GME valuation
This is not financial advice (maybe we need to change some laws if we have to always write these disclosures)  I‚Äôm a former financial adviser that left the business back in 2012 because I was tired of the manipulation by large institutions. The game is rigged but understand the game if you are going to play.  What is GME worth- for all of you that like the stock. I think what you are saying is that you like video games, and the culture around gaming, and you want to support is a company that promotes those ideas. I can fully get behind that. And I can hope the GME management took the run up in stock price as an opportunity to bring some of your new capital in, and continue to restructure and develop a really amazing company around the future of gaming.  At some point though the price of GME stopped being about GME fundamentals or even a restructured growth story and started to be about a short squeeze. A very valid reason to buy the stock. Watching this all play out I noticed there was a point that short interest stopped going down. Institutions are sharks and will sell their grandmothers for a few dollars but many belong to larger entities that are not about to let a small trading arm take down their whole company. When the shorts stopped covering it wasn‚Äôt because they were continuing to hold onto their losing bet. But it was because they had already lost. The legal entities and their clearing houses holding these short positions were already theoretically bankrupt. It did not matter what the overnight borrowing costs to short the stock were and it didn‚Äôt matter what the price went to if the entity was bankrupt at $300, it is not More bankrupt at $400. You can be right about bankrupting some Wall Street institutions but still lose money if you are paying more for your trade than you will ever get back. My theory on the trading range over the past week is that some long side institutions said it wasn‚Äôt worth owning over a certain amount and were willing to buy at maybe $150 but wanted to sell at $300 (these numbers are theoretical). Bankruptcy payouts take a long time, and if your money is tied up waiting for a bankruptcy judge to approve who gets what money... well that can take years. Not ideal for portfolio returns.    Summed up there is some value that can be extracted from the shorts but that dollar amount is not infinite. There is an upper bound on the short squeeze price. Also, and this is more speculation the longer this goes on the better Wall Street will be at extracting value out of the bankrupt institutions and shifting more risk to the bankrupt entities, and unwinding risk off of the other entities. If you are bankrupt you don‚Äôt borrow your last dollars from your credit card to put it on black, you put it on fucking 17 and hope the payout bails you out. And if you and your friend are both in trouble you talk your friend who is already bankrupt into borrowing a few more dollars (because no one can save him anyway) and ‚Äúgiving‚Äù you that money so you can get out debt.  I bought some GME this morning because it felt like a good gamble and my guess is that there are still some shorts value in the short entities

WE ARE HAVING SEX WITH THE GROUNDHOG (The Great GME Comeback)
If there is any DD you should read today, it‚Äôs certainly not this one. Today is February 2nd, the hedgies thought Groundhog‚Äôs Day could be used as a cucking mechanism against us retarded apes. They should‚Äôve known better than to fuck with us. As an owner of GME, BB, NOK, AMC and Blockbuster, I know how shitty today has felt for a lot of people.  BUT THIS IS WHERE YOU LISTEN. To all the new investors that have just joined this sub over the last week and a half: Buy, the fucking, dip. It‚Äôs really that simple. So when I was eating crayons and having not fucking a groundhog five years ago, my novice dumbass investing brain thought you sold to save anything you had left - that was WRONG. Instead, when you buy more shares at a lower price, you LOWER YOUR COST BASIS.  What does this mean?  It means if you bought 10 shares of GME at $300 and then bought another 10 at $80, your cost basis is $190. Essentially, you‚Äôre not only lessening losses but you now have the potential to make even sweeter tendies. Now, when the price goes back up to $300 (which it will, because we are lubing that groundhog anus), you will now have a gain of $2,200. Yes, you‚Äôre buying more shares, but you‚Äôre now getting better value. That‚Äôs what fucking matters.   TLDR: Buy. It actually makes things cheaper in the long-run during rebounds and can make you richer. Panic selling will only hurt you more.

How GME IS going to the moon(Yes, it's still possible) (Crucial pls read)
Obligatory: First, non of this is financial advise&I'm not a financial advisor Secondly, I'm not sure if this fits in DD since this is more psychology so mods please correct the flair if I'm using the wrong one.  That being said: I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here.  The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists. Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet? Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us. The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted,  still holds true . According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.  Spamming        will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult    What to do  What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that  the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed . If we all understand this fact we  win . The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself:  Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?  If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY.   TLDR  Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we   this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far . The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.  Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong   GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD   To rebuild faith in reason:  -Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot -Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever -Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship

You would have to be a genuine idiot to not take advantage of these prices! AMC Has been bailed out by our retard power and now it‚Äôs in the crosshairs of Amazon and Disney. If they purchase AMC that equals gains and a huge gaping wound for the Wall Street hedge funds
Panicked at the drop, then gave my balls a tug. Tripled my investment at the sale

A REMINDER: ONLY AND ONLY IF WE SELL WE LOSE (MODS PLS DONT DELETE)
I know that market is jumping up and down like your wife on her boyfriend's cock, the value is dropping straight to hell,   apparently   damnation is near and   apparently   there is no redemption, but this is what they want us to believe to all of this shit, and most of all, they want us to sell.   I repeat:  # THEY WANT US TO SELL.  I ain't no smart guy, I barely stand up by myself without being helped and I usually eat crayons for breakfast.  So don't trust me, nor your own eyes or ape's brain.  # Trust the numbers.  # Trust the facts.  Rockets, diamonds, moon, yadda yadda, you know the drill.
GME and a rigged horse race
Your friend just got the hot tip on a race horse who is a sure thing and you think fuck it... why not.  The bookie you use takes your bet and prices the horse 25/1... the horse wins the race by 75 lengths and you‚Äôre convinced it‚Äôs worth betting again.  The next race, the horse comes back and for some reason the bookie didn‚Äôt even bother to price the odds correctly and prices the horses odds at 20/1. You take your winnings from last week and pile it all on your favourite horse to win again.  This cycle continues for a few weeks until you‚Äôve taken your initial sum of money and cleared out the bookie for hundreds of thousands, millions perhaps.  This weeks race comes up and the bookie realised how much money you‚Äôve made from this one horse and decides he doesn‚Äôt want to live with that kind of a loss to his balance sheet.  You place your bet with all of your winnings for this weeks race and again, the horses odds stay the same.  The bookie then makes a trip to the racecourse where your horse is, pauses the race and starts to smack your horse with a baseball bat to its legs for a while and then finally lets the race proceed.   You lose your bet, all your winnings and the bookie is back to where he started because he couldn‚Äôt face having to lose all his money.  If this was a true story, the bookie and whoever helped him set this whole incident up would be sent to jail for defrauding the gambling industry and fixing the outcome of a race.  What‚Äôs so different about what happened to GME and what this story described?
Bought more during dip. IM NOT LEAVING!!
Likely Revenge on Broker Hawks: GOOD NEWS!!
You guys and gals will be delighted to hear about this: the JOSEPH SAVERI LAW FIRM is litigating a class action law suit against  35  defendants, including Robinhood, Melvin Capital, Citadel, etc.!  Link:    In case you zoomers, boomers, and everyone in between have never heard of them,   is literally one of the world‚Äôs best and most successful firms for antitrust litigation.  Read the article if you‚Äôre still mad at all these brokers for limiting our ability to buy, because frankly, if anyone can win this lawsuit, it would be the Joseph Saveri Law Firm.  Now, I got this news from a lawyer myself, so I‚Äôm not exactly sure about this, but at the end of the article it states ‚ÄúPlaintiffs seek to recover damages, as well as injunctive relief, on behalf of themselves and the proposed class, from the defendants.‚Äù Based on lines near the beginning, I assume this ‚Äúclass‚Äù is any retail investor invested in any of the 12 companies‚Äô (YES, 12) stocks mentioned?? If so, wouldn‚Äôt this mean we would all be entitled to compensation?  I hope so. Until then, hold, and buy the dip.  (That is the sole opinion of the writer and not financial advice)  Good luck and Godspeed to all our GME brethren around the world!
Im not selling!!!!    ‚Äôs wya!?
In 26 hours, I've lost more than half my retirement. GME & AMC
Holding since 40. Got a loan and bought more in the dip. I like the stock
Just bought another 100 AMC.
Buying the dip.
Do not underestimate the enemy. Seize on the opportunity.
Well, if you think that you will get your tendies without any resistance, you are a fool.  Of course, they will use every trick of the book.  Am I biased? Yes, do I seek confirmation bias? You bet. Am I an autist? Helloo!  I just doubled my position and throwed in 30k more. If this thing went to the moon and back once, I believe it will go to another galaxy far far away.  These guys are really bad (and not the wife bf kind of bad). They control the market. They are the market makers. They know whats going on. They have all kind of data and info to enable them to reduce maximum loss.  it is true they were caught off guard in the beginning, but they fucking had time to regroup and utilize their mate and force against you stupid fellow autist and retard. You bet they have all kind of algos to buy all the paper hands while they ladder attack the shit out of this stock. They have money and power. To expect less means you are beyond redemption kind of retardation.  The thing you should understand is that they are in the bargaining stage. They want to shack of the most amount of leaves of the tree before they accept their inevitable faith.  You have to consider that we went to the moon and back without a single comment from RC or the company. I find that strange, but I would not be very surprised if the SEC fucking threatened them, knowing how rigged is the system. But you bet they have something big cooking. You bet they have multiple billion ideas to turn around the company. You bet they have a thousand trillion offers made to them by the aliens and gods of the universe to capitalise on this movement that was never seen before and never will be seen.  So, what to do? Well, you fucking buy and thank your wife's bf for keeping your wife away from distracting you to seize on this opportunity to buy. Because soon enough, you would fucking regret not buying, similar to how you fucking felt when the price was 500+ and you are sitting on a sorry ass amount of shares. Double down, because we got them by the balls and your future sell will regret it either way if you dont capitalize on this opportunity.  I like the stock.  PS. I am not going to proof read this message. English is not my first language. Live through the shitty grammar and spelling mistake of an autist mind.  Peace.
Did it for the boyz
I didn‚Äôt lose money, I paid to be on the right side of history.

GME - Literally Fake News - Heavy Buying Volume
PIN THIS: We got duped Wed 1/27 10:20 AM
Link to Schwab account on wed 1/27 @ 10:22 AM:     Worth noting Schwab went down from about 10 to 10:30 and prevented trades on GME, and others.  The account balance was up 1,000‚Äôs of percents at time of photo.   What‚Äôs weird though? For this to have had happened GME share price would have had to have been in the $1000‚Äôs for the calls to be up so much. No paper trail shown on any broker so how did this happen? We‚Äôre all no men of coincidences.. I think we all got duper Wed. and the short squeeze could have happened.  Anyone else have screenshots or photos? Let‚Äôs get this shit on blast!  Side note: low level customer service rep credited account $200 with minimal complaining.. things that make you go hm.
AMC Yolo update - 2/2/21 Still holding.
I want to officially thank the hedge funds to get the price down lower so I could buy even more GME! Thanks! We all hold to the moon!
GME & AMC      (update in the past 10 mins)   BUY & HOLD
GME down 50%! Guys I am so scared!!!
FUCK I AM SO AFRAID  for these hedge fuckers, cuz i all i fucking see is one hell of a discount.  so when I see RED, I BUY THE FUCKING DIP LIKE OG BUFFET TOLD ME TOO              Remember to hold, because everyday you hold, they pay the brokers, the more they pay the brokers, the more money there is for us to cash in on when the shorts run out of cash. It WILL be weeks, if not months, because of how fucked this entire situation is. God speed my fellow autismos. And Remember that everyday this stonk is red is another opportunity to BUY. Look at the weekly and monthly charts, the daily charts will agitate you because what is happening is criminal
Joined the party late, If I can hold. You can hold.
Down 88% and still holding $GME because I like this stock!

Takeaways from Mark Cuban's AMA:
# 1) We took some hits... but are still in the game:  > There  was only one thing that messed you all up: RobinHood and the other zero  commission brokers that everyone used didnt have enough capital to fund  the fight.  They let you down in a big way.   >   >When  you load back up, fight a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on  their balance sheet. Someone that can be there when the fight starts  and wont blink an eye.     # 2) We   üèª the stock...  >If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold.  I dont own it, but thats what i would do.     # 3) And when we are set up in decent brokerages we UNLEASH HELL  >Why  ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to  buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you  get to make it all work (...)   >   >(  know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the  more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only  question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going  to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a  group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont  cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.     And last but not least...  # 4) Seems that pushing for Market Manipulation and counting on the SEC is a dead end:  >As far as naked shorting,  thats not really a thing. Yes there can be  more shares shorted than there are original float. That is by design. (...)   >   >(...) So the chain of custody is there.  The systems is doing what its designed to do.   >   >(  SEC is a mess. I wouldnt trust them to do the right thing ever.     So we :  Put our big boy pants on. ->   üèª this bitch. -> Transfer to a decent brokerage -> Make 'em bleed.
Sure I‚Äôll hold. It‚Äôs a red day overall but I still have warm tendies.   üèª

WallStreet Dirty tactics - for all of you who read my post from yesterday for AMC and GME
Just a prime example of what I wrote yesterday.   IF WE ARE RESTRICTED FROM BUYING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STOCK THEN WHOS PLACING ORDERS TO BUY BIG QUANTITIES FOR CHEAPPPP ON LEVEL II???? STRAIGHT UP MANIPULATION‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è   1)BIG dip to cause FEAR. A small RECOVERY for people to PANIC SELL believing to cut LOSSES at recovery   2)Compare VOLUME from last week to this week and yet BIG PRICE MOVEMENT. PROOF of MANIPULATION   3) Restricting purchase = RESTRICTING DEMAND = MANIPULATING A PRICE DROP. How is it that if you COMPARE GME, AMC, BB charts since last week, they all move up and down about the same time in a synchronized order‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è   4) NOT SELLING = NOT LOSING. (yes, you may have loses and are RED but they‚Äôre UNREALIZED LOSSES). You DONT lose until you SELL.   5)Media talking that the squeeze is over and that retail lost interest and demand for these stocks. NO WE DID NOT LOSE INTEREST we are being ILLEGALLY RESTRICTED FROM PURCHASING   6)check posts how around the world they‚Äôre being RESTRICTED from buying   7)I believe in the VW model of infinity squeeze. I think that‚Äôs what Wall Street is afraid of  8)REINFORCEMENTS - A lot of ppl had to open new broker accounts such as FIDELITY and have to wait to get funded. I believe once THIS BS RESTRICTION around the world is OVER we will     üåï.  9) All we can do is HOLD AND BUY    üåï our loses are limited by our investment but our GAINS ARE UNLIMITED  WALL STREET DID NOT END THE SHORT SQUEEZE! They just prolonged it  with their BS tactics and restrictions. AS LONG AS WE BELIEVE, BUY AND HOLD they‚Äôre screwed. It‚Äôll just take more time
Literally NOBODY is selling. Riding the rocket with you guys  KEEP HOLDING
I fucking LOVE THIS STOCK SO MUCH
No crazy DD or dank memage for u dumbys but... I just love your resilience!
When the going gets tough literally everyone here straps in and holds  . No one said this would be easy and I‚Äôm just proud to be a part of something bigger than myself and my wife‚Äôs boyfriend.   A lot of elitists in this community don‚Äôt like the new additions to our retarded family but I welcome you all. We are all brothers, I think we know who the real enemy is. So bears and bulls need to unite for just this one time to save us all.  We‚Äôre heading into overtime bois, time to get off the bench and step up our game. WE LIKE THIS STOCK!
A call to arms : Much to ask, but hold isn‚Äôt enough. PLS don‚Äôt delete.
If they‚Äôre allowed to restrict buying for the next few days it will absolutely kill morale and momentum. I am sure we have many soldiers with dry powder ready to go once their RH debacle frees up.   But we will not last until more troops arrive if we do not push back now. Etoro forced sales on GME, cash app restricts buying, many more platforms restricting buy side; they‚Äôre throwing everything they got at us. They‚Äôre trying to change the narrative of short interest. This isn‚Äôt just about the hedge funds anymore; it‚Äôs the whole system up to the market makers who have dropped the ball.  We need to buy in order to live to fight. Chamath and Cuban hints at the power we have, holding isn‚Äôt the right message now. Our power lies in retard strength. And now, I am willing to get even more retarded!  Do hedge funds hold when they see a opportunity? They go for the jugular. My life has been a movie since I basically yolo‚Äôd into GME last sept, but now I‚Äôm back in with a purpose. Diamond no more, rocket hands only.  tl;dr We have to BUY the stocks we like.   Position :    üèΩ GME
My dick is so hard holding these
Doing my part to help my fellow retards!
You Can Buy 100 Shares Of GME Now

Did anyone notice the crazy high strikes, high premiums and newer open interest? They might‚Äôve raised cash by leaving themselves super exposed on naked calls...
Bullish signs on a seemingly tragic day, we're still in the game: price action DD
EDIT: forgot to add GME in the title. This is for the GME boyz  Just like last week, we are under a low-volume short ladder. And just like last week, bulls are hindered by brokerages' restrictions.  However, a remarkable thing happened today: GME tested a previous ATH/resistance ($  GME first pulled back from that price point on Jan 21st, when the price opened at $42 and closed in the $60s. It was the first day ever trading was halted intraday, and our first massive win against hedge funds. $  slapped us in the face and called us his bitch.    So, why is today's price action bullish?    Because when a stock tests previous ATHs and it   BOUNCES OFF OF THEM  , thus turning a resistance into a support, it's a sign that the stock is still healthy and has potential for an even more powerful run.   PLTR did that, NIO did that too in the past.   They went sky high (not as GME duh), tested previous ATHs, then kept flying to their own moon trips.  Now look at GME recovery.  And imagine how high it's going to fly again once brokerages let us monkeys out of our cages by lifting restrictions. Yes, GME could test the $500 resistance again after testing the $  resistance now turned into support.  Guys, I don't have the vocabulary to explain how bullish this is in my opinion. I am blessed I can buy GME on my broker, looking forward for an amazing run through Q4.    To GME newbies: this has always been a Q4 play. I was expecting the squeeze to happen after Q4 ER revealed what a powerhouse GME is, and I still do. Accumulate, hold, squeeze, cheer.    DISCLAIMER: not financial advice. First bought GME in October, paper handed in late January, back in the game after seeing today's price action.
Putting back capital into stocks that I like. $PLTR and $CRSR gang wya?
For my cake day, I bought more GME!
BOTs are being used to spread negative sentiment about GME. Start reporting, Autists!
All right retards, given the current drop in the price, a lot of bots are being deployed to spread negative sentiment about GME and to push silver.   How do I know this? I track the market sentiment for all the stocks using activity from Reddit and Twitter. I have never seen so many bots being deployed at the same time to change the market sentiment. They can't fucking cover their short positions and are using bots to make us panic sell.               Mods: please ban the user's spam botting the same comment again and again. Fellow Retards do your part and report it.    Stay safe, and remember the golden rule:
Mackenzie Bezos has better    than you autists
MacKenzie Bezos was able to        her investment for 26 years. You autists are complaining after being down 30% after one week. Bezos wife understood the value in holding the dip and held her position through the dotcom crash so she could cash out in 2019 for $38 billion. Her position was in the red for 10 years before Amazon finally recovered, and you autists can't even hold through two red days. If MacKenzie can hold for 26 years, you autists can hold GME for more than 2 weeks.  Tldr:        and one day you might become a billionare from Amazon.  Disclaimer: This post is satire and not financial advice. SEC fuck off and start investigating the short sellers.

What is Market Tuition? How to Handle Loss
I know exactly what you did... You saw some deep red in your portfolio today and got scared as it kept going down in the morning volatility. You probably felt fucked... Then when it kept going, you just had enough and   sold  . Through the constant preaching of "holding the line," you left your position and "realized" your loss with hands made of papyrus.  In all seriousness, this isn't to shit on you or say that you failed your part. Chances are, if you're reading this then you're in need of some help (or you know someone who does need help). The reasons you may have had to pull the sell-trigger are none of our business.  What you just experienced is what I like to call   "Market Tuition."    Now that you've solidified or "realized" whatever loss potential you may have had, here is some advice to help you accept the loss and move on.  # 1. Try not to get caught up in thinking about the past.  What's done is done. You've made your position and settled your exit. The less you think about it, the faster you can recover both mentally and financially. Consider a break. Do the shit that makes you happy and distracts you far away from the market.  # 2. Consider what's left, look at what's ahead  Look at what you have left. And if nothing else, assuming you have a source of income, it may bring you some solace knowing that you can file  . In some ways, you can say that the government is taking on the weight of your loss.  # 3. "It's just numbers"  It may be difficult to look at your portfolio and see it as "just numbers". After all, these "numbers" could have taken you months or years to accrue. But the more you simplify the event, the better you can accept what has happened.  There was a larger number in your portfolio, now there is a smaller number. That's all it is.  # 4. Close the position? Close the chart.  Stop looking at the stock chart. Plain and simple. Prevent yourself from regretting your decisions. If you are no longer in the position and are not considering a new one any time soon, then it's probably best to distance yourself away from any reminders of your loss.  # 5. You lost money. But gained experience.  This is a cost of learning how to feel the market. Not everyone is born with diamond hands. Many people, just like you, second-guess their positions. Even the most experienced investor can doubt his/her securities. But if nothing else, the market teaches discipline. What could you do differently next time? Did you have a game plan? If the answer to that was no, I'm sure you'll be less likely to go without one next time.  Once you've considered all of these steps, then you're already well on your way to recovery. I'm not gonna tell you how to use your money. But consider this advice from someone else who has  .  I've spent the past year recouping loss. And finally, after all this time obsessing over charts and news, I broke even last week. It was a combination of a small steady income and investing my small positions into stable growers until I had enough to do larger option plays. And by that time, I was much more prepared.  Money will come and go. Are you going to waste your time thinking about it?  Or will you start your journey to recover losses and break-even as an even better investor.  You can make it back. Godspeed.
It's Called Buying The Dip, 20% in 2 minutes!
JUST AS IT WAS GOING UP AGAIN THEY SUSPEND GME
GME is severely undervalued.
Ryan Cohen and his Chewy team he brought in are worth atleast $10-12 billion alone. (See chewy at $42 billion)   Not to mention GameStops state if the art game trade in and game buy back systemüî• which is probably worth another $50-80 billion by itself.   Put all of that together and just right there GME should be valued between $60-90 billion. Not even to mention their real estate locations.   Right now GME market cap is only $7 billion so really we should be sitting atleast   higher than we are now, NOT EVEN COUNTING THE SQUEEZE.   STRAP IN BOY AND GIRLS AND HOLD ON

Start Playing Towards Your Strengths, and Stop Acting Invincible. Much like GameStop, WSB Must Return to Their Core Competencies to Succeed.
Listen up retards, and most importantly new members, it is important that you actually read this post and others. I know it‚Äôs a joke around here, too many words can‚Äôt read, I get it. Information is a valuable weapon, stop voluntarily ignoring it.  I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stock, and that is why I am going to provide some insight into how GME arrived to the position they are in, and how WSB arrived to the position we are in now.    GameStop Backstory    I will briefly cover the backstory of GameStop, but for more accurate information and in depth discussion I recommend you listen to Rod Alzmann‚Äôs GME DD as a guest on the Modern Guilt podcast found on Spotify.   Essentially, GameStop began to slip as E-commerce grew and management went through several changes before arriving at what we have now. As a result, earlier management tried to pivot away from GameStop‚Äôs core competencies (large user base and trade-in/second hand sales) which pushed it further into misfortune. Eventually the board we have now chose to double down on their core competencies and improve upon them rather than restructure entirely.    WSB Backstory    Leading up to the now viral GME bonanza, this sub and the strategies used were much different. GME started off as a value play, although a significant subsection of that following always had their eyes on a potential squeeze play. The following was small at first, but grew as GMEs potential grew. The core competencies of the following consisted of excellent DD, knowledgeable users willing to share research, and less knowledgeable users willing to learn.  I no longer feel as though this is the core competency of GME gang, the strategy has shifted towards strength in numbers and raw unadulterated conviction. That is not a bad thing and I will get to that later.  Once the GME squeeze became apparent and the sub was soon consumed almost entirely by GME gang, the original competencies actually flourished. Users provided excellent research on the mechanisms at which hedge funds could be held at bay in the midst of the squeeze. The prevailing strategy was to buy shares only, never use margin or over leverage yourself, and not to purchase options.   Those competencies were what made WSB unstoppable in the begging, and they were based on pure reason alone. Buying shares would reduce float and put pressure on HFs, avoiding margin and over leveraging would prevent users from panic selling or liquidating due to margin calls, and avoiding options would concentrate power into a strategy that gave hedge funds little wiggle room.  These strategies worked, and you can check the first week and a half of the GME movement to confirm that it was rock solid. But then something happened, people saw opportunity and started buying options on the side or completely instead of shares. Because of the original momentum this actually ended up benefitting the strategy significantly, it resulted in all calls ending ITM on the Friday before last week, it produced a gamma squeeze.  But that tactic is short lived, the MMs quickly started writing a vast spread of options and priced many users out with premium.   The options strategy is no longer feasible in the near term, momentum is gone and the options ladder spreads traders too thin.    I understand the allure of options, but just consider the amount of money that vanished last Friday. Calculate the cost of all of those options from $330-$800 and consider how much ammo was wasted. Yes, it was stolen form you, it wouldn‚Äôt have happened if not for manipulation and brokers blocking GME buys, but it is time to adapt and overcome.    Return to your core competencies, and improve upon them. Stop ignoring thorough DD and stop neglecting to do your own, do not allow your fellow members to post information without scrutiny. Return to the original thesis      Improve the Core Competencies    We are in a grim stage of the squeeze and many are nervous, but it is essential at this point to steer into the skid.   If you read anything in this post it should be this.   The stock price falling gives us strength if you look past the fear. The squeeze is about leveraging the small amount of float that is urgently needed by hedge funds. Hedge funds have an abundance of money, but they lack the volume to close their positions. Individual retail investors lack money but they are capable of leveraging the scarce volume available against HFs.   Think about this, HFs are burning money to drive the price down but they need shares to stop bleeding. When the price is low, retail investors become more capable of obtaining shares. The price being low puts HFs in a   bad position  . At low prices retail investors are able to hoard large quantities of shares, further increasing the scarcity. For those of you who bought or are willing to buy at $250, $300, $400 etc, I salute you but I don‚Äôt encourage this behavior.   Buying high spreads your resources thin and results in diminishing returns.   Let them trigger the short sell rule, let them give you a discount    A squeeze can start at $1 or $1000, it doesn‚Äôt matter, and the base cost of the stock equally doesn‚Äôt matter in an infinity squeeze.  Return to your core competencies, allow hedge funds to bleed themselves dry in their effort to deter us by lowering the stock price. Buy when the price is cheap, allow it to inflate naturally, and wait for it fall again before loading up more. Once the resources are entirely out of reach for the hedge funds, there are three ways to win. A positive catalyst, natural price growth, or simply allowing them to bleed themselves to death.  Options are no longer effective, consolidate your efforts.  Do your part to spread and scrutinize important information.   Stop slacking and letting others pick up the work for you. If you‚Äôre still on Robinhood, set up a fidelity account or an alternative immediately. If you‚Äôre still on margin take it off. If youre still allowing your broker to lend your shares call them. Get extended hours trading. Get off toxic brokerage platforms.  Return to your core competencies and stop running in circles.  I am not a financial advisor, nothing in this post should be used as investment advice. This is my take on a purely speculative situation, and I recommend you do your own research before entering or exiting any trade. I like the stock and own GME shares.      TL:DR: for starters, stop slacking off and actually read DD posts, information is essential in warfare. Stop buying options, they were an effective weapon that was purposefully neutralized by MMs and now works against us. Return to the strategy that got us to this point.      The price dropping allows retail investors to maximize the effectiveness of the only weapon they truly have against HFs      it‚Äôs time to fight in the mud
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win!
Why are you guys still using Robinhood?
Robinhood fucked you guys over so hard and yet I see dozens of posts of RH screenshots every hour. Fucking get off of RH and move to another brokerage. Stop posting screenshots of RH. You're just supporting the company that fucked you each time you post a screenshot of yourself using RH. Don't talk about diamond hands and how RH is manipulative and tanked GME when you still use RH. Practice what you preach and gtfo Robinhood.     STOP SCREENSHOTTING FROM ROBINHOOD!

WE SHALL RISE ONCE AGAIN. phoenix in fire, the stars shall be reaching for us.
Hey retards, I know confidence is down, with GameStop reaching all the way down to the $80s, and AMC hitting a dip. But it doesn't stop here. It will not stop. IT NEVER STOPS. The stock may fall, but again the stock can rise from the ashes like a bright red   phoenix   blazing with fire. We've come so far, must we give up our   hope  , our   dignity  , our   power   we so slowly but rightfully finally began to gain? Before reddit was just a social media platform; a joke platform where people could come to for a laugh. Now look at us. Making the big moneies cry, news outlets despiratly spreading rummors to test our strenght and try to rip us appart. They try to make us collapse, try to make us crash with fallen out teeth and broken bones. BUT WE DO NOT BREAK. WE DO NOT FALL. We are one, and together, we shall rise higher than a man could dream. Higher than the stars can reach. The stars, the stars shall reach for us.  Now take advantage of these dips while you still can, because prices are rising, and strength is gaining. We shall sore higher than any bird will ever fly. We are wallstreet.

Robinhood is manipulating the market by slowly increasing the buying limit
If robinhood was really struggling for liquidity then they should have removed the buying limit by now.   They have received over 3 billion in investor funding per their clearing house requirement, or so they say.  These restrictions came into play when the stock price was over $200-300 for GME and $15-17 for AMC. Both of these stocks are now half their fucking value.   If their reasoning to restrict buying is that they needed to have the funds to cover their clients purchases as well as the stock being exuberantly high then WHY THE FUCK THERE STILL A RESTRICTION???   Because vlad just loves the taste of citadel and Melvin Capital Dick. And that's Dick with Capital D.   Fucking market manipulation. Mark Cuban says to hold and stick it to them, so I am.   I'm down 12k today alone. AND I JUST BOUGHT MORE AMC GME.
Finally - I am now breaking even after some $NBG and then some Witches fiasco.

Buy when there‚Äôs blood in the street, even if it‚Äôs your own  ü§≤üèº
Not a single one of us can do this alone, and honestly I was getting pretty shook for a second watching my own money go up in flames. Anytime in the last 2 days that someone in my life has nominated themselves to tell me I should just sell, just let it go, just get out‚Äî I don‚Äôt miss half a fucking BEAT before saying ‚Äúno.‚Äù   Because I‚Äôm not fucking selling.  We are right.  This sub has been filled with ACTUAL due diligence the last two days, meaningful conversations, the sharing of information between unlikely opponents to huge financial institutions, of COURSE the cards are stacked against us. You fucking kidding me? You thought they were just going to give you gold covered shorts and throw in the towel as a Christmas present?  Ha, oops, we ONLY lost several billion dollars, it‚Äôs fine.  If you think that, then you are even too retarded for THIS sub. We have to FIGHT for this to work out, it‚Äôs a fucking blood bath‚Äî but don‚Äôt fucking trick yourselves into throwing a pity party like it‚Äôs only your blood being spilled. You‚Äôve now seen how the game is played, how it‚Äôs rigged, how it‚Äôs contorted and drawn out and galvanized to benefit the other side of the trade desk. We are out here fighting the short battle of fucking Thermopylae and some of you are losing interest? Losing hope? Losing attention? Then fucking clear out, we don‚Äôt host fucking pity parties on this sub.   The camaraderie and bonding that I‚Äôve seen on this sub in the last few weeks, even with all the newcomers, has honestly been something I haven‚Äôt seen here in this magnitude before. We‚Äôre here together, we‚Äôre fighting this together, we might as well stay in this together.   And if there‚Äôs anything I needed to see to restore the little bit of hope that was starting to falter, it was Mark Cuban‚Äôs AMA. We CAN do this. We have BEEN doing it.  They‚Äôre fucking scared.  We‚Äôre fucking scared. Folks at home on their couches are fucking scared. Stop pretending like your worries & fears are singular or unique to you. It‚Äôs fight or flight time, so either hold the fucking line with your brothers and sisters, or shut the fuck up and post your loss porn once you sell. This sub was  NEVER  for the faint of heart, or the squeamish.   This is not financial advice‚Äî but if I  could  give financial advice, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt publicize it for you poo putt ass paper-hands to see. ü§≤üèº

WELCOME TO WALL STREET
This one goes out for all the new ones here (I've lurked and commented here for about 6 years), this whole experience is nothing new here. Flash back a year ago even and hardly anyone but fringe finance people came on here regularly. But loss porn has been going on around here a long time. Come for the gainz and stay for the collective laughs of the loss porn.   Something to keep in mind though, it's hardly 100% of our portfolio for most of us and we want to be in the game a lot longer than one play. It's for the principle for this one and I went into it with full intentions on losing every dollar I put in and I hope to fucking God you did too but probably not because you're a fucking retard just like many.   But there's a light at the end of the tunnel. (kinda) there's always another play, there's always tomorrow to squeeze another HF nuts. THE KEY IS KEEP CASH TO STAY IN THE GAME, wherever you want to put it. Like a retarded phoenix you will rise from the ashes more retarded than ever with a chip on your shoulder against THE MAN.  WELCOME TO WALL STREET YOU FUCKERS

We all need to learn from this
(Before you downvote please read)  1: The most important point is you cannot beat the big guys, it doesn‚Äôt matter one bit, you will not win. They have the politicians, brokers, and market makers in their pockets, you can‚Äôt win at a broken game. The only way to make money is to ride their wave because as we all know, they always win, or to play something that they do not know of and have no desire to dabble in.  2: WSB has grown exponentially in the past week or so, and for everyone who is new, this does not happen often. There is usually a meme stock such as TSLA or PLTR, but these do not boom like GME, this was a one off occasion.  3: The second the plays off WSB become mainstream, we lose. Everyone and their brother wanted to get in on these ‚Äúfree‚Äù tendies, but with that came a lot of paper handed bitches who sold when it went down 10%, which caused exponential destruction of the stock price.  4: Finally for everyone, this is an opportunity for us to learn, and to use WSB as a tool to gain wealth. We can look as other peoples DD and do our own DD on those picks and see what we like, and WSB is overall a meme sub where people post gain and loss porn and we all are amazed at what can happen.
We don't win if we don't BUY THE FKN DIP
We dont need much, the majority of the work has been done. However, simply holding doesnt stop their ladder attacks. They are trading securities they already are holding themselves. If we take what is left in the market or worse, whats put in by paper hands, we reduce the pool of available shares and their ladder attacks only go so far.  What happens if everyone holds and no buying occurs?   They can drive the price down as much as they damn well feel like, causing more and more people to sell in the hysteria.     There are so few shares out there that could even remotely begin to cover their damn positions with (remember, they shorted over 100% of shares before this whole run up) meaning they HAVE to cover their asses eventually and the ladder attacks cannot go on as long as we BUY to REDUCE their efficacy and HOLD to force the demand upwards and reverse this momentum they are creating.     WE ARE NOT GUARANTEED A SHORT SQUEEZE    We need to make that happen ourselves. Right now, we are at the precipice of the squeeze. Either it happens, by us buying whats left (NOT ON RH, OR OTHER RESTRICTED PLATFORMS) or we hold like the real retards while these rich fucks laugh their asses off and double down their short positions to do what they have inevitably been doing this whole damn time, which is making money on the way down.  What'll it be boys?     ü§ö  I hope you know what to do            EDIT: Listen to Mark Cuban, switch brokers, Vanguard and Fidelity have been popular. A quick Google search can tell you to avoid Apex Clearing House Backed brokers and RH. Those of us who don't have restrictions imposed can carry you until then. Were in this together boys and we can do this thing
Pleas fly again
Simpleton Version
So let's put it in simple words so everyone has a clear picture of what's happening.   The float is the number of tradable shares of a company's stock.   1) Melvin and his chums shorted 140% of the float. Since stock is issued by the company, and short sellers have to borrow stock to conduct their business, this means they shorted 40% more than the number of shares that were ever issued. So, being greedy, they borrowed fake shares to short to really kick the company in the balls.   2) Even after shorting 140%, Melvin still lost $6 billion give or take. Also, Melvin is owned by Citadel, who doesn't like that their baby lost.   3) So.. Citadel turns to his other, uglier child called Robinloot (Citadel gives Robinloot 40% of their allowance), and tells him to stop letting everyone buy more shares, only sell.   4) Citadel get's all major media outlets to report that Reddit buyers are flocking to Silver to try and divert away from GME and AMC. Luckily, we have the internet and phones and this isn't the 90's with dial up. So for some of those pricks who went to school for journalism and paid $60k to study how to write a fucking article, could just open this page and see that WSB was in fact saying they didn't buy Silver.   5) Citadel also owns almost   of SLV ETF, is one of the largest buyers of calls and also owns large amounts of shares in more than 10 other instruments tracking silver.      TL;DR:   Citadel is conveniently related to every single part of what's going on.   I didn't move from a third world country to deal with this kind of bullshit and open corruption and market manipulation. What the fuck.      AOC, Biden, Elon, Chamath, Mark Cuban, Kevin O'Leary or anybody who can help, please help. This is ridiculous now.      PS: I am a fiction writer not a financial adviser.  Edit: If Netflix want to use this info for the movie, I‚Äôll do it for $1 mill. Thanks

We worship nothing but the free market
That is what I love about this place. We're retards, and we proudly wear our helmets on the short bus. We do it because the market knows best. It will sort out the men from the boys, the autists from the retards. We post our positions and reasons, and the market will reliably deliver maximum pain. Unless it's   with...   When the free market is inhibited by blatant manipulation and changing goal posts, it prevents some players from losing no matter how wrong they were. They think they are free from the rules of the market, but we will show them otherwise.  Not advice. 90ish shares of gme 400 amc and a bunch of calls
HOLD
Stop selling you
Beware echo chambers. Most people here own $GME and they are incentivized by other people buying and holding.
Even here you see people say ‚ÄúDo your own DD‚Äù. Scrolling through WSB and only reading posts that talk about how great it is to buy and hold $GME is not doing DD. Echo chambers are dangerous and you need to be researching before you trade. How could Qanon be so stupid to believe they were right when the media/everyone else was pointing out flaws in their logic? It‚Äôs because they were unwilling to see other points of view. Guard yourself and actually do real DD.
Still holding for my brothers and sisters. I‚Äôm not selling, add 100 more AMC. I will add 50 more GME this Friday. Diamond Hands

Make r/wallstreetbets autistic again
Alright, listen up you fucks.  In the past couple of weeks our sub count has almost doubled. What does this mean? It means that purely by the numbers, our favourite fucking subreddit is no longer only comprised of autists. We can fix this in one of two ways: we boot all the new joiners, or welcome them in our little autistic dinosaur arms and force autism into their ass like a gay Harvey Weinstein.  Right now, this autist is leaning toward the former. All this horseshit about "sticking it to the suits" is driving my cue ball brain up the fucking wall. What the fuck do you mean? Squeeze out the 2 funds that are short so you can shit money for the other 30 fucking funds that are long? Don't give me some bullshit that there's actual justice being done here. It's only about the fucking money. You retarded fucking bagholders are only telling people to buy because you can't accept your portfolio looking like Donald Trump's colon.  There's also the unlimited supply of dogshit here every day now about how GME and AMC are fundamentally worth their spiked prices. Isn't this against rule 7 of the sub? GME was visibly failing and AMC was billions in debt even before the pandemic. Buy whatever the fuck you want, but WSB doesn't endorse making shit up about fundamentals you don't understand. Saying "this isn't financial advice" in your post means nothing. Confirmation bias at this level opens the SEC to investigate us for market manipulation.  And finally, to the new guys in our midst: if you came to this sub hoping to make money, you were fucking retarded and get the fuck out. Go to  .  Yours sincerely,  A long-time single-celled degenerate

I know I'm new and I don't know a lot about psychology but just wanted to say this is really a psychological warfare. If dipping from 400ish to 120ish didn't work, dipping to around 80 and STAYING THERE like they are fighting so hard to do now,  might just work in their opinion. I can feel it's a lot worse than before so I guess that's their play now but GUESS WHAT! IDGAF I'm holding soooo hard to my   share you can't even imagine. I'm even planning on selling some stocks to buy some more in this dip even tho I'm   scared. Hold on people      I'm not a financial advisor so whatever.

The hedgies are currently extremly fucked - here is why
Just ignoring that:     \- Tons of bots promoting anything other than GME.  \- Tons of news saying WSB was responsible for a surge in SLV and an apparent squeeze which will NEVER happen. Citadel holdst the 6th most shares in SLV.  \- Tons of TV-news reporting the same  \- The stock being sold way undervalue between hedge funds that have shorted the stock by over 110%.  \- Portraying us as lazy, greedy, irrational and Alt-right people promoting GME       The price of all Citadel held stocks including GME and AMC are appearing as lower because much lower since the stocks are are getting pingponged between the hedgies for lower prices for the algorithm to make the stocks appear lower. a few hundred thousand stocks are being ping ponged for lower and lower prices between the firms  .      Every day we hold and buy the dip the hedgies are getting even more fucked. They are extremly fucked.        The price you are seeing means absolutely nothing. Buy and hold - do not sell to buy in again low since we are getting restricted. Just hold    211 bought just now at 97. and 200 spread out over 100 to 330.

Why is the stock plummeting so much? MARK CUBAN WILL TELL YOU WHY!
question asked by u/pinklips_indy  answered by u/mcuban :    "Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.  Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.  That then accelerates the selling.  Which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with GME in particular  So what to do ?  If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.  I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.  I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street."     \ personal position\  11 shares @ $245

GME Pep Talk and Facts
üåï 36mil in volume is not a lot! These guys shorted around $5 so unless the stock hits $5 you're fine. Even then, you're fine if we don't sell. Don't be paper handed. Most retailers are still holding.  This is a once in a lifetime chance. Red is just a color, it will change if you hold and buy the dip. I plan on buying more near end of day myself!    The short itself will probably happen after Thursday Feb. 4th.   This is because that would be the 13th consecutive day of Failure to Deliver on a threshold security. But this only happens if the shorts can't deliver the shares they owe. They're trying to illegally drive the price down so when they buy back they can avoid a squeeze. I'm a literal retard, but I have a feeling the price is gonna start going back up on Thursday or next week. Maybe someone can explain more    Retail investors own over 100% of the actual shares. This means the price goes as high as we want it to go. It will keep climbing until we sell. They are using every trick in the book because they know they're f cked! This is literally free money if we all hold. There is nothing they can do but try to scare you.    I sold my meager 40 shares like a paper handed bitch a few days ago, but have seen the error of my ways and I've been buying back in. I'm going to buy over 40 shares this time to make up for it. HOOOOOLD.  Lastly, remember to remove your stop losses so you don't sell!  For SEC interns, this is not financial advice. Idk what I'm talking about. I like the stock. Ryan Cohen is great.    EDIT:        EDIT 2:   I am speculating on when the short squeeze will happen but I'm a retard. You hold this stock even if Feb 4th comes and goes. Truthfully, it could be weeks before the squeeze happens.
I‚Äôm HOLDING strong fellow retards!

Guys, I bought the lowest dip this morning! But I'm probably also a retard to think the next three days $GME will hit the Strike of $800
SNM Analysis & Predictions
I felt it was time for me to gather some thoughts about ShaMaran. Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?  It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels! When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with‚Ä¶  ‚ÄùSo only there is a nice rise for the stock!‚Äù  Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel.  But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $  million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.  Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.   Refund from KGR  That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of   million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!               Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market!   I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?       Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves  We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here.   2   million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80¬†000-100¬†000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 =   So in about   years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen?   How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...    KRG and Baghdad Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?             Sarsang and Total  Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell.          Plan for expansion  It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field.   Page 3.     Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result!       ‚ÄùInstallation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility"  I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August.   Page 8     So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?  ‚ÄùInstallation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (  brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.‚Äù   Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.   Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.   And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.    The bond        We'll see what happens there. But I think we'll be surprised. With Lundin you can never know. "expect the unexpected" When i add up everything. ShaMaran has never looked more interesting. And had so many triggers for the stock lined up in the near future. Now there is only one direction for the stock and it is up.
HOLD, EVEN THE LITTLE GUYS ARE HOLDING
Holding!!!
Just added 8 more, scared money don‚Äôt make money. Fuck the hedgies, eat the tendies: hold, buy, hold.    . Not a financial advisor, not a professional, not advice.
Current price versus my avg cost isn‚Äôt looking happy, hopefully my diamond hands will save me
Just bought 25 shares GME to the moon IM NOT SELLING
If you‚Äôre not buying more shares now, you better go do that now (Not financial advice)
Might as well post some loss porn for you Apes, but I'll continue to hold with the best of you
What to do and not do if you want to partake in GME mania
This is not a post about whether GME is going to 0 or Pluto. This post is strictly about what one should or shouldn‚Äôt do if one wants to buy/sell GME.      1. Figure out how much you are willing to trade. Treat the money you are willing to trade as lost money. This way you know your max loss and if you are willing to accept that loss, then you can diamond hand any red day.     2. Don‚Äôt trade on margin. One of my best friends bought AMD at $2 and still lost it all because he went on margin and was forced to liquidate. Brokerages can and will manually liquidate your positions to cover their asses. Bottom line, don‚Äôt do it.      3. Have an exit strategy. Let‚Äôs be honest here, the distance to the moon, Pluto, and Andromeda are finite, same goes for GME. You don‚Äôt have to admit it to anyone on WSB, but you should always have a number that when reached, you are willing to exit.     4. Don‚Äôt get greedy. The saying that pigs get fat hogs get slaughtered is very true. Ask any   who held on past 4/1/2020 to show you their account and you will see. Again, you don‚Äôt have to admit it here, but know it in your heart.     5. Be fluid. Market condition changes, that goes both ways. Assuming you are following the above rules, there may be days where you will buy the dip. To the contrary, there may be days when you profit take.      6. Don‚Äôt be a sheep. Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves for a moment. Not all hedge funds are betting against GME. There are hedge funds betting on GME. Moreover, there are people who are trying to profit from directional movement in either direction and are spreading lies on WSB to enrich themselves. Don‚Äôt be a sheep and blindly follow others.     7. Be on the look out for the next 10 bagger. I assume that almost no one here wants GME to be their last trade. I‚Äôm not saying you should sell your positions, what I‚Äôm saying is always be on the lookout for the next big thing while you hold on to your position. It would be the same thing as you getting into GME when it was $5.     8. Don‚Äôt let GME break you. Trading takes a toll no matter if you are up or down. Don‚Äôt let one trade crush you. Remember, you are trading to get rich so you can better yourself, not trading to become a slave.     \ I have never purchased or sold short,  nor do I intend to purchase or sell short any GME equities or derivatives. Having said that, I wish my WSB brothers best of luck.
Enjoy the loss porn, Im not selling. In fact I bought more GME

A poem for the paperhanded
A friend of mine wrote a poem that explains the strategy of a marvelous trader we both look up to. It's sweet, it's short, but not short like those hedge funds we're about to squeeze. Here goes!  Take it easy, Take it slow. Sell when it's high, After buying when it's low.  Emotion is dangerous, Leave it out of the game. Become a true robot, And you'll always trade the same.  Hold with both hands, Hold it till you're right. And if it doesn't listen, Cut your loss without spite.  Find value in the symbol, And play what's in play. The secret to profits, Is to do this every day.  Common sense is gifted, Use it to its fullest. Don't overthink stuff, Are you bearish or bullish.  Manage risk at all costs, Small losses and big wins. The house controls the market, But you pull your own strings.  So get on going now, And focus as a pro. Discipline and patience, Will make your portfolio grow.  Use it to your advantage, one day you might be sailing the sea of tendies on the SS Diamond Hands.

Gonna keep buying and keep gonna keep holding

When profit taking is shamed upon...
This is the end result.  People get left holding the bag and blow up their portfolio.    For the last year or so that I‚Äôve been apart of this sub, people would celebrate the gains and loss porn but there is a huge problem when almost this entire sub would shame you for taking profits (and then finding new entry points).   Now you got the mod team stickying comments for gambling/help hotlines and that‚Äôs when you know how bad and truly fucked people are from these last two weeks.   Everyone talking about the manipulation to get you to sell, what about the ones to get you hold through a 5000% run up only for it to tank now

Thought this meant buy more, so I added 10 more shares.
They're dumping shares onto the market, CONTINUE TO HOLD
While looking at the bids and asks on Gamestop I noticed that at the start a lot of ask's with a lot of shares were placed, those are probably by institutional investors. My theory is that they were dumping a lot of stocks onto the market to make it seem like the stock is plummeting. Just look at this bid with 30k shares:        The good news is that it seems like they can't keep up with the volume since most of us are holding the stock, and because most retail investors already bought GME, it seems like the demand is going down.        So what does that mean for us? As long as we're not able to match the dumping of shares onto the market with enough demand the price will probably continue to go down, but that doesn't matter as long as we keep holding with our FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS  ü§≤!!  I SEE YOU ON THE MOON RETARDS    Edit: this is not financial advice, I just REALLY like this stock  !

Haven't been able to risk money on the previous market values, but I was able to buy 1 stock on the dip! It's not much, but it's honest work. Now to HOLD!
Ouuuuuchhhhhhh Pain is weakness coming out of your body -HOlding
Bought another 400 shares today. Y'all thought this would be easy?? Only the strong survive. FUCK THE SUITS
GME could go to $1 and I will still hold
Eventually the shorts have to cover. When they do, they'll need buyers. When that happens, sure, hedgies will be able to cover a few shares at $1, but once covering begins in earnest, its gonna shoot into the sky. My question is whete are all our brand-new billionaire buds in all this? Kind words and encouragement, thanks bro. How about you put your money where your mouth is and buy this ladder up and save our asses. Ir are you fucking scared to lose an actual piece of your wealth?
Yes, I will keep holding this catastrophe , I'm a retard who doesn't give you financial advice and I bought a lot of shares when it was at 270 and I just lost it all, but idc I'll keep holding. If you keep holding to, we might win this shit. GO FOR THE PLAT HANDS MA DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!
Last of mo-meme-kins
Listen up fuckfaces (so far so good?)    99% of you retards don't know what the fuck is going on. Buy this, no buy that,  no it dipped, sell, oh no it went up, I'm a retard. This is what I'm constantly seeing from all the new faces  A certain 5G stock #knockknock has been getting hype for a few weeks now and it has REASONABLY been ignored because we support our brothers fighting the good GME fight.  NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT  everyone keeps complaining about how high of a float this stock is.   I GUARANTEE you that is not an issue. The publicity that this got this week was unprecedented. We bought so much that these fucks are restricting us from buying a leading 5g stock that has been around since 1865. My broker told me I had to cancel my sell order because it was stuck in citadels order book. What the FUCK does that mean? We are being suppressed for a reason. HEDGE FUNDS LIKE THE STOCK  And guess what motherfuckers!? I LIKE THE GOD DAMN STOCK TOO!  Price target $50+:  1. Most essential 5G patents in the world 2. Fastest 5G speeds recorded 3. Controls over 27% of the 4/5G market 4. First company contracted to set up internet on the moon (NASA) 5. Will receive MULTI-BILLION dollar settlements from ongoing litigations with Mercedes Benz and Lenovo 6. Technology provider and main collaborator of the National Security Center of Excellence 5G Cybersecurity Project (Federal 5G project) 7. Selected to be the main collaborator of the Hexa 6G European Union Project 8. Has pending Department of Defense contracts yet to awarded 9. Just sealed a contract with TMOBILE for US 5G roll out. 10. Has and will take market share from Huawei, already has secured multi-year deals with important Chinese companies 11. Blackrock increased their position to 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase) 12.

PSA : BB is sexy
I love you GME gang, but the real story today is that BB is trading at an amazing discount. It's caught in the GME crossfire and creates an amazing value opportunity  Go look at the good DDs that were initially posted and keep in mind they have a 50%+ market share in their industry (UEM for corporations and Govs, OS for vehicules and communication encryption for multiple clients). BB is everywhere around you and you don't necessarily realize it.  Could it go back down to $8 with all the bullshit going down? Sure it could. Can it go back up to $30 by EOY? Conservatively, yes. They are working hard to change perceptions and even without the initial hype, $20-30 usd is a very conservative valuation for BB when you look at comparables and at their financials.  Not everything is a squeeze and remember that GME started as a value play more than a year ago...  Disclosure : I just passed an order to add 125 shares on top of my 4 leap contracts.
Remember! That‚Äòs the dip!
PATIENCE RETARDS, BUY THE FIRE SALE

I decided to just say screw it, all my marbles are in now! HOLDING STRONG         $GME
Barely just started investing and don't have much tied up in $GME compared to a lot of you, but this red doesn't scare me. Holding til the squoze. Guess I'm just smooth brained and eat crayons.
Diamond handed ape
Need some encouraging words (AMC holder)
Bought AMC on Monday at   , today is at  , I'm overwhelmed, sad, from 10k down 7k. But still holding, no other option. Fuck them all, but for realzzzz is fucking hard.
How to not get F'd by Degiro that won't allow a limit sell order higher than $20?
I tried setting a limit sell on the moon but it says it's too far from the last traded price - WTF is this crap? How is a retail investor supposed to buy/sell at the right price without watching the price literally 24/7?
Shouldn't we file class action lawsuits against brokers for knowingly causing harm by banning GME, AMC for buy?
Don't you think that banning certain stocks for buy by the major brokers is a deliberate action aimed at causing harm to their clients as they cause imbalance in the supply/demand? If it's harder for those who want stock to buy it than to sell, this drives the price down which is definitely illegal to do in purpose. Shouldn't we file the lawsuits against them for causing this damage?  Edit: We are not talking about Robinhood, but about all of them.

Rallying call of GME - Little guy versus the corrupt criminal elite, analysis, and how to beat them
I read through the posts here and see so much confusion, chaos, and fear, especially after a day like today where people see losses. People need to understand the GME saga is not united in its ideology. You need to adapt your expectations to that key fundamental fact. There are many factions of "investors" here. This was the case from the beginning, and has  as time went on and public exposure to the stock grew. People have their own agendas and plans, their own unique circumstances. This innate disunity is what is being used against you.  The billion dollar hedge funds know your lack of cohesion can be exploited, and that is exactly what they are doing. It is actually their only option. What else can they do? Admit defeat, close their doors forever and swallow untold tens of billions more in losses to cover their still numerous outstanding shorts? No, they are going to keep kicking the can down the road as long as they can, hoping to break your chokehold on them by exploiting your factions. They do this with lying, cheating, market manipulation and much more. But their main play to break the squeeze is the same: they need you to scatter and sell. Why did the VW squeeze of 2008 work so well? Because one single company (Porsche) bought up all the stock and one person was making all the decisions about holding and selling. In that case, the hedge funds were the ones caught off-guard,  scrambling in disarray to compete with each other and grab up all the shares they could. Right now, those same hedge funds are acting in collaboration and we, the retail investors are the ones in disarray.   There are people who bought GME to make money. Everybody loves money right? That's probably why most people bought it. But there are also a lot of people who bought GME as a form of protest and revenge against the criminal class of Wall Street. There are people who love the company Gamestop and envision a brilliant future for it. Some people took personal offense to shorts coming in and trying to break down a store they like. Some people just really like the stock. Maybe people bought it for all of the above and much more.  No matter the reason, if you want to win, you will need to find common ground and learn to work together if you want to see the line go up and force those cornered hedge fund shorts to pay up. You have been given a golden opportunity to squeeze billions out of these Wall Street funds. It is very unlikely an event like this will happen again, at least not for a very long time.   What I saw this morning was a predictable product of our innate disunity. Due to the viral exposure of WSB and the GME frenzy many new investors moved in last week in a very short amount of time. This created a "hype" bubble, which is actually fairly common in the stock market and happens all the time. This brought in all sorts of novice and first time stock owners, especially ones who don't understand basic stock market mechanics like price, volume, and order books. (Please people, learn that price does not mean much without VOLUME) They came in hoping to make a quick buck. They bought in at a higher price last week, saw the price per share tumble Friday, fell for all the fake news, rumors and distractions over the weekend because they don't understand that hedge funds lie for a business, saw the share price tumble today without understanding why, then panicked. They sold, dropping the price further, which panicked other investors of the same mindset, they sold, and so on until stop losses were triggered and caused more sales which panicked further people who sold and so on. This has been a strategy of the hedge funds since day one of taking money from the dumb retail market. It is just particularly effective when there is a bubble in stock price. This is actually an argument many people use as a justification of shorts, as they keep the entire market rational and prevent a bubble from ever forming so big that it has catastrophic economic consequences. But that is neither here nor there. But the point is people are confusing two separate events, this rapid bubble that formed last week and popped some steam off today, and the squeeze which has been a steady and gradual process. Remember, GME was $4 just 6 months ago. What was the low price today, with the stock price manipulation and panic selling here? Somewhere around $80?  Which is right about where the price was last week Monday just before it went absolutely viral.   GME is still heavily overshorted. The Bloomberg terminal screenshot posted in another post here shows 90% as of today, 2/2/21. We are still in a squeeze. Yes, we had a temporary bubble and setback from our climb up, but no, this is not over by any stretch of the imagination. If you want to see the share price keep climbing then HOLD. If you want to see Wall Street bleed, choke on their arrogance and hubris, then HOLD. If you want to make Gamestop the funniest meme in all of stock market history, HOLD!!!! Feeding the hedge funds back shares at a lower price takes the pressure off them and lets them cover while mitigating their losses. Don't feed the hedge funds. We have the upperhand. We have the power and leverage. Only we can give it up and squander it away. They are the ones bleeding millions in interest. They are the ones with furious shareholders and wealth investors breathing down their necks. It costs us nothing but the own stress we give ourselves to hold. I agree we are up against a rigged system. We should all be calling and emailing our congress representatives to demand investigations into why so many brokers shut out new buyers but not sellers starting Thursday. We should be demanding investigations into institutional shorters who are manipulating the stock price purposefully by pingponging shares back and forth to each other with lower and lower prices supplemented with coordinated large dumps. We should be demanding investigations into what the financial relationships are, if any, between certain brokers who froze out buyers and these institutions with massive shorts on GME that we are betting against. We should be demanding adherence to SEC rules regarding transparent short positions. There is a lot to fix and change. So let's try to stay united on the things we can all agree on, like making the market fair for the little guy. Let's stay united in our vigilance against deceit and misinformation spread by these shorters. Let's stay united in our conviction to HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No amount of short ladder attacks, price manipulation, rumors, or fake news can scare us holders into selling. Why? Because we are ideologically united. The money will follow, if you hold.      This is not financial advice and I am not a professional. I hold GME, 42 shares @ average of $138
Hey GMEtards: sometimes we just make a bad call. Ball up, admit it, and get to recovering.
TL;DR: Read the fucking post. This is more therapeutic for my own disappointment than it is me trying to "teach" you guys the most important lesson.  ##I fucked up today   and it cost me $7k that I will most likely be realizing all or most tomorrow.  I set a long term PT on GME of $40-60 because I want to see a $10bn GameStop in the next year or so and instead I got excited and emotional and jumped in around the $129 mark this afternoon thinking "tHe SqOzEnInG".    my screw-up because I got emotional and didn't wait patiently to see if the "upward" trend this afternoon had firm footing. Spoiler alert: it did not. I was only up by about $2k when the floor fell out from under me.  I am EXTREMELY LUCKY because I've been trading all the way up and managed to sell quite a lot of $19dca shares at $380 and throw those profits into my savings account, but I left $25k (about 25% of my gains) in my investment account to "play around" with.  My CPA said not to, and I thought I could outsmart him. Ideally tomorrow won't be straight red, and I can escape with $17k or more (hopefully) but this should teach you that:  ##SOMETIMES YOU MAKE A SHIT TRADE.   That's why you're supposed to play with money that you can UNEMOTIONALLY LOSE. Seriously guys, it's giving me secondhand panic to see the guys who threw their savings in at $300 and watching the value sink very steadily down to $80 (and possibly less) and then they justify it with "buuuuut it's to show the 1% how powerful I am!" They're still billionaires and you're getting evicted. You really showed them.  ##Going forward? I'll write this $7k against my gains and maybe toss the remaining $17k into the SPY or something boomerish while I wait to file my taxes next year OR I'll drop the position to 100 shares realizing about $3,000 in losses and sell weekly covered calls to  hopefully  chase the decreasing share price until I feel comfortable holding very long term or get assigned above my DCA.  Inb4 "MELVIN BOT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Where did the positivity go?
Even earlier today the sentiment around GME was very positive. Although we are dipping down into the depths of hell, everyone was staying positive and trusted that the squeeze has not happened. This was not true when I sorted comments/posts to controversial though, as they were mostly negative.   Now, late in the day, it seems like the positive sentiment is gone and almost overrun by the negative talk that was exactly like the ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù comments. What happened exactly? Did I miss something? What hard evidence/proof that the short squeeze happened is making people suddenly so negative?

My favorite and least favorite part of all this
Thinking back from the past month there is one thing that has stood out and resonated with me more than anything else.  This is simply that the vast majority of people are generous when they come across a sudden inflow of cash. As soon as people here started making money, you guys started immediately paying it forward, which is absolutely incredible to see.   For this you should be incredibly proud of yourselves.     It is encouraging to see that people can maintain the capability to care about others when they come across money, this is the way it should be.    My least favorite part is how the media tried to paint this place in a way that tricks the general population into thinking we‚Äôre the enemies, yet during all of this there has been nothing but helping each other out and ensuring that the wealth was spread in ways to those that weren‚Äôt able to participate or finding ways to help someone else. The media then praises Wall Street for cheating, stealing, and continuing their parasitic tendencies. It just goes to show you who is in control of the narrative;   Scared sociopathic wealthy people who know the majority are far better people than they‚Äôll ever be so they try and compensate with their socio-economic status, when in reality, it just shows how sad and insecure you have always been.     Wall Street individuals should take a step back and realize that lining their pockets isn‚Äôt all that life is about and at a certain point of net worth, accumulating wealth doesn‚Äôt even bring happiness anymore and does not get you anything extra at the end of life. A more enriching way to go through life is by finding ways to bring joy and easing pain for others. Be selfless instead of selfish and I can guarantee when your time comes, you‚Äôll look back and feel that your life truly had a purpose and your family will be honored to carry on your legacy.  Right now, you folks on Wall Street betting against and fighting back at this movement are no better than a street drug addict who steals. Desperate, scared, and has no other option than to fuck someone else over. That‚Äôs not the best legacy to leave behind. In fact, it‚Äôs down right disgraceful. The majority of you Wall Street folks should consider going through some therapy because your way of thinking is not normal. You got lucky, you are not special, and if you lack empathy you probably have some unaddressed trauma from your past.    TLDR  : Selflessness will always make you feel better than selfishness.   If you are against this movement you are proving to the world that you do in fact have severe mental issues and they are taking away your ability to create true happiness for yourself, you should talk with someone to help you through this. It is not too late to change your way of thinking towards other people.  If you read all of this, thank you. Obviously it doesn‚Äôt change anything, but I really thought you should all know that the generosity is appreciated and gives hope that people aren‚Äôt all bad.   Stay strong ya‚Äôll this shit   IS NOT OVER  .
Another $GME chart.. cuz why not
Fore-warning: I am not a financial analyst or advisor. I literally started investing today. If you take my advice, you are an ape.   Also, this is hardly a DD, but I'm highly retarded so I flaired it as one.           All I want to do is bring awareness to the volume. Look at the shiny graph above. Take a second to look at the volume by price range (the red and green sideways bar), the volume (in blue), and then the volume rate of change (green graph at the bottom). When the stonk was beginning to take off, volume was high with modest rates of change in volume. What does this mean?  Well, what you'd expect: people hearing of the stonk and buying more. As it peaked, volume dropped. Interestingly, volume rate of change was low (and even negative at one point). Both of these were low until today, and yet the stonk kept falling - what does this tell you? Hint: check some of the top posts in this sub. Coupled with the volume by price, there seems to be a net buying interest. I want to now point out the hump in the volume rate of change corresponding to today. Notice how the first hump happened early in the day as the stonk continued to plummet. Based on some WSB sentiment, this is likely scare tactics working and cuckies fearing the worst and selling off to lock in gains (or limit losses). But more importantly, notice the big peak in rate of change as the stonk dropped. People are seeing this offer as a discount and buying in. Coupled with all the other theories with what hedge funds and RH (etc.) are doing, we can reasonably infer that these scare tactics are working. I mean, why wouldn't they? We are shitting bricks. I expect more red dildo days. You know what that means right? Stonkies go downsies =  buy the dip.      TLDR: Cuckies will crumble, but we bringing the beer virus to the moon.
Sorry guys but the SQUEEZE WAS SQUOZE
Financial advice for people who just joined WSB from a degenerate veteran
TLDR : Only invest with WSB what you're willing to lose.     Recently, there's been a huge influx of people who joined WSB in hopes of making millions of dollars and buying Lamborghinis. I'm here to give you some boring ass boomer advice : WSB is less of an investing subreddit and more of a gambling one.  Sir, this is a casino.  I mean, it's in the name, right? WallStreet   BETS    Over the last few years that I've been a member, I've seen a lot of people YOLO their life savings on SPY calls and puts and lose bigly. These people are WSB legends, but are also actual retards.   However, I'd say that a significant percentage of us are  smart  investors. By that I mean that we are financially responsible enough to know not to put all of our life savings into Gourds.  I don't have a financial background, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've been a member of personalfinance and financialindependence subreddits for a while before joining WSB. I'm not asking you to be a degenerate autist and put your money on boomer ass dividend stocks and jerk off over making $2 on dividends a year, but to be a  little  bit more responsible with your money. By that, I mean the following :     If you have student loans, try paying back your student loans ASAP since those will fuck with you the most. If you are broke ass shit, and jacked to tits in 200k loans, the last thing you want to do is to take out more loans to gamble on memestonks. See what your minimum payments are and try to hit those and if you have money leftover, you can use that to fuck around with.     Save 3 months of rent and food (depending on where you live, I'd say about $3000) in an emergency savings account (or some boomer low-risk ETF like VOO). Do this because if you lose ALL your money, where the fuck are you going to stay and eat?    Before throwing all your money in Robinhood, put some in your ROTH IRA since the taxman won't take away a lot of your gains.    If you do make hella gains on some YOLO option on Robinhood, save like 20% or whatever that short-term capital gain amount is for the taxman or he'll come back to bite you in the ass.    Once you have some emergency cash stored (or are willing to live with your parents), and have made some minimal contributions to your ROTH IRA, aren't swimming in credit card and student loans and can make your minimum payments , you are now ready to be a WSB degenerate.  This isn't an investing subreddit. A lot of us play with money which we are okay with losing. Although, I've made   a LOT more   on RH than I have on the measly 10% yearly gains with my ROTH IRA and 401K, it's nice to see that on red days when the market is drilling into the earth's asshole and all my weeklies will expire worthless, I still haven't lost as much in my other boomer accounts.   Once you feel like you're in a comfortable enough place in life where your only source of income is NOT your weekly SPY calls, you are now ready to be a WSB degenerate like us. Start off testing the waters by buying a few shares of some of the most mentioned tickers here without doing any DD since   we can't read   and lose some money on shitty stocks $PLTR and $MT.  (Edit: relax fellow palantards, this is a joke. I, too, am a ~~bagholder~~ believer)   Once you feel like you understand the little intricacies of the market (Bad earnings == stonk fall, good earnings == stonks go up but maybe could go down also, Biden president meaning WEED and CLEAN ENERGY go UP), you can now invest invest in options.    Optional : Buy a cheap $  option that is way over the money to understand how options work, what theta decay is, etc   I like to think of RH as playing roulette, where I just toss a bunch of $$ on hype stocks and hope for the best, but you could also make some safe bets depending on your risk tolerance and actually try to do some DD yourself, but we don't do that here.   In the late 2020 tech "crash" I lost over $5000 on dumb ass tech calls, but it didn't really affect me that much since it was my "play money" and  you win some you lose some . If that money actually meant a lot to me, I'd have been super fucked. So yeah, if you were to get ONE thing out of this post:    Only "invest" with WSB what you're willing to lose.     Here's some other lessons I've learned over the years :     Don't give stock tips to ANYONE, especially family. (Learned that the hard way, read my previous post)     If you're going full retard and investing in penny stocks, stop-loss is your friend.   Having said that, welcome to WSB.   Positions :   100 GME @ $  on October 12 and still holding.
We're in this together. Hold!

About GME short interest
I'm still holding and I think the squeeze is still on. If it wasn't wouldn't we have heard of someone who was holding millions of shares sell like AMC?         GME was shorted to 120%, that is around 82 million shares, if we are to believe the short interest has dropped to around 50% that is 57 million shares.  So my question is who were the paper-handed bitches that sold 57 million shares ain't no way that was all retail right?

What is the gameplan here?
So from my understanding, if....     1. Hedge funds are using short ladder attacks to drive this down to the bottom 2. Retail investors are throttled on how much they can buy 3. Hedge funds seem to be at the same time covering their short positions without bumping the price of our meme stocks     Say we keep holding and occasionally   this rate, why would this work? I don't know if holding and occasionally buying from retail investors will led to any sort of rally if we're up against the systematic + coordinated ladder attack by the trading algorithms hedge funds....

Emotion and bias
I know that many of us who are holding are likely down a significant portion of our investment today (I am holding 10 shares @ 298), but what is bothering me is the departure from factual/statistical DD in exchange for a lot of wishful thinking.  ‚Äç‚†Ä  I'm only 18, and I'll admit that I went into this as a sort of gamble. I was confident that, given the short float, we'd see a significant jump (more than it had already risen); first it was hypothesized for last Friday, then Monday, then today, and now tomorrow. Most DD for GameStop is full of groupthink assertments, and some even misinforming those who don't know better that something that may never happen is certain to occur within whatever timeframe.  ‚†Ä  I'm upset that I likely lost a huge sum of money (to me), and I'm continuing to hold, but now more than ever is the time to base our claims on facts and statistics, refrain from irrational or wishful thinking, discuss and prepare for worst case scenarios; think realistically.
This is what we play for #riteofpassage
Remember, It‚Äôs Not a Loss Till You Sell. Consider Today as Paying For Your Ticket To Tendie Town.
As a fellow ape, I understand that the red color looks bad and stock is down. If you‚Äôre not used to this like I have become, please read on. You must remember all of the fake news, bots, trading halts, market manipulation, and pissed off billionaires. Something smells rotten and we‚Äôre right over the target with a cleaning crew. They have proven this with their actions.   It‚Äôs not a loss until you sell and the only way we‚Äôre taking this trade to parabolic levels is by holding. Melvin Capital is down 50% and he will be down 50 more by the time we‚Äôre done with him.   Also, think of the jobs we saved. AMC theaters can reopen because of us autists. We are actively saving jobs and getting more young people interested in trading. Not to mention the fact we have woken nearly everyone up to how these hedge funds have been bending us over for decades. It is a morally depraved to sell at these low prices. We‚Äôre not giving them a life raft.  Reject gay media stories, post your sexy loss porn, and hold. Fellow autistic apes are counting on you.   TLDR: We have become the modern day Robinhood. Today was the price for our one way tickets to FUCKING VALHALLA. BUY THE DIP  Edit: Dropped these.                 Edit 2: Also, don‚Äôt invest money you can‚Äôt afford to loose. This is a very crazy scenario that has many different possible outcomes. Some of those outcomes involve you loosing all your money. Let‚Äôs all board these rockets with smartly allocated funds. Your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will thank you

BlackBerry Is The Future!!!!
Listen up boys, BlackBerry has no trade restriction anymore on RH. Furthermore Jeff Bezos just stepped down as CEO of Amazon. Who is replacing him you might ask, good question it's none other than Andy Jassy the AWS leader. Whys is this important? IVY is his project and now he is at the top of AMAZON. Not gunna do a DD on the BB IVY partnership because there are plenty of incredible ones out there already in just BlackBerry and AMAZON are 50/50 partners in IVY. Look BB is not a Meme Stonk but it is a huge long term play. It is easily worth $60 and currently because of RH is sitting on major sale at $  ish. Not a Financial advisor just some retard on the internet telling you why I am right.  Edit: BB is not the next GME and I don‚Äôt want anyone to think it is. Just a solid company and has huge future potential IMO

Can we still win? Why? Realistic timeline?
I‚Äôm seeing a lot of paper hands out there, but I‚Äôm ready to go down with the ship.    üèΩ   Now, I still find myself asking questions with the hopes of learning what I can from this whole event.   1. Can we still win?  I feel like WSB is no longer an accurate place for information. Yes some of it is real and good but you have to sort through so much crap. How many of us apes are imposters posting fake loss porn and fake HOLD posts to convince everyone else into holding the bag?  Is there any precedent to what we are up against?  2. What do we stand to gain at this point? How long do we have to hang tight? If the shares are not being bought by us but instead by hedge funds... then won‚Äôt they be able to recycle the shares enough times to escape at a reduced cost and there will be no squeeze? I‚Äôm a retard so I don‚Äôt quite fully get this, but people‚Äôs comments make me think this is possible.   3. How can WSB lift the facts up and not just what we want to hear? The sub is so saturated now as I mentioned above. How can we focus on pushing this event to the finish line? We need to unify. I moved my other meme stock positions to GME to fortify the line.   4. At the very least we had fun doing it, right? I‚Äôve had fun. Gonna keep battling with you tards. Never play with more than you can afford to lose.    I hope the squeeze has not yet been squoze. I hope all of you posting loss porn and buying into the culture are real and not bots.   Let‚Äôs discuss like apes below...

Jeff Bezos steps down as Amazon CEO
.        Fellow Amazonians:  I‚Äôm excited to announce that this Q3 I‚Äôll transition to Executive Chair of the Amazon Board and Andy Jassy will become CEO. In the Exec Chair role, I intend to focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives. Andy is well known inside the company and has been at Amazon almost as long as I have. He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.  This journey began some 27 years ago. Amazon was only an idea, and it had no name. The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the internet?‚Äù Blessedly, I haven‚Äôt had to explain that in a long while.  Today, we employ   million talented, dedicated people, serve hundreds of millions of customers and businesses, and are widely recognized as one of the most successful companies in the world.  How did that happen? Invention. Invention is the root of our success. We‚Äôve done crazy things together, and then made them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime‚Äôs insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more. If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.  I don‚Äôt know of another company with an invention track record as good as Amazon‚Äôs, and I believe we are at our most inventive right now. I hope you are as proud of our inventiveness as I am. I think you should be.  As Amazon became large, we decided to use our scale and scope to lead on important social issues. Two high-impact examples: our $15 minimum wage and the Climate Pledge. In both cases, we staked out leadership positions and then asked others to come along with us. In both cases, it‚Äôs working. Other large companies are coming our way. I hope you‚Äôre proud of that as well.  I find my work meaningful and fun. I get to work with the smartest, most talented, most ingenious teammates. When times have been good, you‚Äôve been humble. When times have been tough, you‚Äôve been strong and supportive, and we‚Äôve made each other laugh. It is a joy to work on this team.  As much as I still tap dance into the office, I‚Äôm excited about this transition. Millions of customers depend on us for our services, and more than a million employees depend on us for their livelihoods. Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it‚Äôs consuming. When you have a responsibility like that, it‚Äôs hard to put attention on anything else. As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions. I‚Äôve never had more energy, and this isn‚Äôt about retiring. I‚Äôm super passionate about the impact I think these organizations can have.  Amazon couldn‚Äôt be better positioned for the future. We are firing on all cylinders, just as the world needs us to. We have things in the pipeline that will continue to astonish. We serve individuals and enterprises, and we‚Äôve pioneered two complete industries and a whole new class of devices. We are leaders in areas as varied as machine learning and logistics, and if an Amazonian‚Äôs idea requires yet another new institutional skill, we‚Äôre flexible enough and patient enough to learn it.  Keep inventing, and don‚Äôt despair when at first the idea looks crazy. Remember to wander. Let curiosity be your compass. It remains Day 1.  Jeff

GME liquidy is drying up - causing the share to become more and more volatile
I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from  .  As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase.   Expect huge swings in the next few days.    Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.  HOWEVER  The short float is still high, and the  .  Furthermore,   only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.   ACTIVE POSITIONS HOLDERS SHARES   :- :- :-   New positions 46 12,880,726   Sold out positions 34 3,412,841   \--  Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.  Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.  \    Disclaimer: I am a poker player, not a day trader.  In poker, this is what we call an "implied odds play". The risk is relatively small for us bulls (relative to the short position), but the expected value is potentially huge if it works.  But these plays are still risky despite being +EV.   You have to be prepared to ride the swings and embrace the variance.     This is pure, uneducated speculation, not financial advice.     TL/DR: Grit your teeth and brace for swings. Shit's about to get nuts.     (Edit: deleted the thing about being put on the short restriction list \[I screwed up the dates\], and added the institutional ownership thing)

GME Stock plummet needs explaining and reassurance.
As I'm not the most literate at the stock market I think it would be EXTREMELY helpful for those of us in the group to do a couple of things;  1. Explain as best they can why they think the stock tanked today. 2. How they imagine the stock to be able to soar again. 3. Provide real data that can be translated in a way for those for of us who need you to explain with crayons on a poster board that makes sense. 4. Explain how the volume of stocks today is different than it was say when the stock hit over $400 a share.  We need the financial savvy humans out there for some reassurance if we want to be able to show that WSB can hold up to its rep. Mark Cuban gave us some advice so I would like the group to show us how we can abide by what was advised so we can SOAR TO THE MF MOON!

Regarding the short selling restriction for GME...
I have seen many people in the comments saying that as of tomorrow, there wont be any short selling allowed for GME. This image was shared of a spreadsheet released by the NYSE:     However, if you look at the image, it says the trigger date is 2/1 and the proposed deactivation date is 2/3... doesn't that mean the restriction started yesterday, and will actually end today? Is there another meaning for "Trigger date" and "Deactivation date"? If someone could clarify what these two mean that would be helpful.  Also mandatory disclaimer that I'm a retard this is not financial advice blah blah blah apes strong

Are we allowed to sue the SEC? Like I‚Äôm an idiot, and sorry if this is a dumb question, I‚Äôm just curious if we can hold them accountable for not regulating the markets accordingly. Shouldnt they of shut down selling the stock after The Robinhood, TD Amitrade restrictions?
Like this is definitely a stupid question, but can someone sue the SEC for not regulating the markets properly? Everything‚Äôs that the hedgefunds have done since we beat them on AMC and GME last Wednesday is manipulate the market and tank the stock. The general consensus is that what has been going on is illegal stock price manipulation and the SEC has done nothing to protect retail stock buyers.   I‚Äôm not saying someone should, but the SEC isn‚Äôt doing their job and we are paying the price for their negligence. Someone should hold them accountable, only way I see the people can do that is by suing them and holding tight until the Suits stop cheating, cuz we beat them and they‚Äôre salty.   #Diamond Hands

Let me first start by saying that at 8 shares my contribution to this movement is a drop in the bucket if that, if GME tanks and I lose everything I can accept that.   Im more so worried about the people that dumped money they couldn't afford to lose so my unprofessional advice (because I'm not a financial advisor) is sell if your gut is telling you to.

I have to say that what‚Äôs currently going on is SCARY. After already seeing a tough monday, expecting a better tuesday: only to get suckerpunched. But.

But as my high europoor ass lays in bed I start thinking about why we‚Äôre here in the first place. They have shorted the stock, more than 112% as of current I think. They Will have to pay at some point and their fees grows. This is a game of chicken. It might go on for a long time but as long as we HOLD we win. That is a mathematical fact.

GME and AMC Apes
Hey guys, first of all I know the morale is low today because of the big attack on GME from the hedge-fucks and their boyfriends.   We need to hold strong, nobody said this battle will be easy or that it was going to be won in one week.  The media put the spotlight on silver to diverge the attention we were getting. We were 2 million last week now we are 8 million. We have grown in numbers and I‚Äôm sure among us are some spies and trolls and just curios people. But I am certain that we will prevail. We need to hold the $100 line tomorrow and get it back to $200 by Friday, the hedgefucks and their boyfriends will have to do some buying in order to cover.  It is mathematically impossible that they have covered from 130% short interest to just 30% that‚Äôs fucking impossible.  1) Up until Friday the short interest had rather increased 2) I know for sure they didn‚Äôt fucking trade over the weekend  3) Retail investors, we are holding a big chunk of those stocks   Wake up ! They are trying to make us surrender, it is impossible that they have covered their positions between Friday and today.   Let‚Äôs hold the line, let‚Äôs get it back to $200-$300 levels.   We might have taken the short ladder down but we will take the elevator going up.  DO NOT LET THOSE BASTARDS WIN, WE MUST REMAIN STRONG AND UNITED. THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING US.   This is our legacy, we are being part of the history of investing and finance. We can be remembered as the ones who stood up against the big guy and won.   We owe this to everyone who has lost before and has had their dreams crushed by the suits.   LETS GO!! HOLD STRONG!! DIAMOND HANDS

Unreal Media Manipulation "Traders Who Launched GameStop Frenzy Are Turning Against New Members"
Imagine if all the retards in the sub could move as one massive retard like the hedge funds we‚Äôre up against - if we could all piggy back u/deepfuckingvalue straight into Valhalla
Crossposts aren‚Äôt allowed, but you retards need to hear this:  ‚ÄúHow a DAO could take the GME case to a different level   While it may rather seem to be a post for r/ethtrader, this is a post in which I try to make the case for how a DAO could supercharge what   did with GME: a collaborative attack on a billion Dollar hedgefund.  I didn't know wallstreetbets before the short squeeze of the GameStop stock and as many people I had to read into what was actually happening. Skimming through media reports the narrative seemed to be plain and simple "Reddit rascals tricking Wallstreet suits". However, if you follow the topic closely on Reddit, you can clearly see that for some people including   this was neither a get-rich-quick scheme nor some joke. People really liked the idea to have the hedgefunds by the balls.  I personally don't think that this sentiment will eventually last (although I hope to be proved wrong). There may be even more people on the Subreddit claiming to hold with diamond hands, however overall there is a lack of proof that people DID hold, contributing to an increasing lack of trust - because people don't know for sure what the majority plans to do or is already doing, people lose the ability to act as a collective.  Now, dealing with a lack of trust even in an environment where people are highly suspicious of each other is somewhat the core feature of cryptocurrencies. A DAO that is able to buy stocks based on the vote of a group of people would allow investors to not only join forces but also to effectively eradicate the prisoners' dilemma that GME stock holders currently experience. This provides retail users with unprecedented powers.  Of course, joining forces is possible for everyone, retail users and bankers - but the wallstreetbets case shows that in the end a viral social media movement can be pretty powerful, at least relatively. The people who would join forces by adding funds to a DAO gain mutual trust and the ability to share risk, but they likewise share the gains and by doing so reduce them heavily. This makes it much less attractive for those who are mainly interested in multiplying investments short-term - people with a political agenda (flip the bird to Wallstreet) won't see this as a problem..  What would be needed is a DAO with a bridge to the stock market. Not as easy, but still possible in the very near future. I am half-sure, we might see this of solution within the next year.‚Äù

‚ÄòKnow thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories‚Äô - Sun Tzu. A THESIS ON GME
In order to adhere to WSB rules, this post is strictly for discussion purposes and not to instigate or coordinate any market activity.  1. Wall Street   As we have seen the past two days, Wall Street has certainly created  a plan of action to fuck us over and drive the price down and cover their shorts in an elongated time span which minimizes their losses (even though they pay more interest over time, it will cost less to cover if they slowly cover while driving the price down ~$200+ due to low volume after the first squeeze). At this rate, Wall Street may very well have this squeeze under some control, and may be able to cover their positions without total market catastrophe. This thesis is under the assumption that S3‚Äôs data was somewhat accurate (~30M shares short currently) and that the 122% short interest from the end of last week is mistaken as the 122% short interest from Jan 15 (68M shares short according to   This information is crucial as it would mean this thesis is the only way to hypothetically guarantee another squeeze no matter what, because simply holding at 30M shares short very well may leave us as the bag holders (downvote me, idc. Someone needs to validly bring up the elephant in the room before this echo chamber turns even more batshit than Qanon).  2. Supply and demand  Thank you to Mark Cuban for the AMA this morning, as he gave me more insight on how this thesis could work. The price of the stock is determined by supply and demand. Given that demand has dropped since Friday, so has the stock price. This sub has gone full retard trying to drive up demand this week, and it has had little effect on wall street‚Äôs plan. The other half of the equation is supply. We have tried limiting supply in one aspect by buying up shares at these high prices, but we haven‚Äôt effectively been limiting supply in the most efficient way. All of the OG GME retards loaded up on OTM long-dated calls back in 2020, and those are now all deep ITM.  Hypothetically  exercising them would decrease the supply of shares in a more cost effective manor than simply buying and holding, and raise the market value based on supply/demand, right? (what do I know tho? I barely passed intro to Econ).  3. The unplanned thesis.  We have seen a lot of referencing of the 2008 Volkswagen squeeze and how there‚Äôs a dip right before the rip. This does NOT correlate with our current dip, as that week was a brutal week in the market in general. What did cause the squeeze was Porsche announcing its raise in the companies stake, REDUCING SUPPLY. The squeeze occurred purely off of supply and demand. We all saw what happened today when GME dipped hard into the 70‚Äôs, the volume was there and the demand was high enough to throw the shorts off of their plan. This forced the hour long spike from people buying and shorts covering, eventually leading shorts to gain control again and rebalance their shitshow situation. I have noticed the unprecedented following that DFV has accumulated in the past few months, and right now he is essentially Tarzan with the amount of smooth brain monkeys he has surrounding him. If DFV were to  hypothetically  informe his beloved followers on his daily YOLO update that he was exercising his april 12c at the next days dip, then the ‚ÄòIF HES HOLDING IM HOLDING‚Äô crowd may turn into the ‚ÄòIF HES HOLDING AND EXERCISING IM HOLDING AND EXERCISING‚Äô right? Monke see Monke do. This section is not meant to incite market manipulation, as I am purely speculative and opening discussion on the psychological effects and market impact this thesis may have. If ITM call holders coincidentally exercised at the same moment intraday when volume and demand are high, would a massive squeeze occur where shorts can‚Äôt get back into their dip/cover daily cycle and are forced to cover it all in a day? I hope the best for us all, and the worst for Wall Street.   Positions: GME 800c 2/19  TLDR: IF supply were dramatically decreased at a point of high volume & demand (before lunchtime) from a bunch of ITM calls being exercised, then GME would squeeze like we all dreamed of.    For legal reasons this post is strictly theoretical discussion and I do not condone market manipulation.  Before anyone says anything, I‚Äôm a first time poster who‚Äôs been autistic since birth, and joined you retards in April
I wanna see Nok goes to the moon.

A number of GME insiders sold when it was round $40
SEC filings:                 Funny thing, no one sold when it was at $400.  Edit: According to MarketSmith, management  only holds abouut 5% or   millions shares and tipsranks said insiders sold 1 millions in the last 3 months? (Management ?= insiders?, dunno.)  Edit 2: If everyone on WSB owns a share of GME, they can overrun the management?
People now pressuring and flat-out belittling others to admit defeat under claims of "their mental well-being" or insulting their intelligence. This wasn't about making the wisest move, this was about turning the game on it's head, so politely I say fuck that and fuck you.
The fact that people are willing to hold despite the risks of losing money out of principle for their shared   here I think is absolutely admirable. I think Mark Cuban gave some inspiring (and expert) advice yesterday, among what he said "Stay with it, I am a believer."   Don't let nihilists set pessimism in your bones.  At the end of the day it's your money, do whatever the fuck you want with it. Also remember billions of dollars are on the line, in my opinion a little bit of suspicion towards new angles emerging to try to convince you all to sell or to redirect your attention isn't unwarranted. But at the end of the day it's likely (mostly) just other normal people. From what I've witnessed these particular people actually say in the comments, condescendingly speaking down to other users, I'd estimate there's a lot more narcissism going on than compassion, the insecure wanting others to emulate their nerves or assuming everyone else isn't as genius as they are to not adopt their cynical take on the situation.  Your path is yours, trust your gut, give em' hell.  Edit - To the "this is a new account fuck you" conspiracy posters, here is my first account - ( I made a new one because my old one is plagued by politics which I no longer want to waste time on and now follow only financial related subreddits so settle yourself down lmao.
We need solid math right now for short calculation
The only information we need to know now is:  1. When does the shorts expires 2. How many shares are expiring at that moment? 3. How much does it cost for each day of delay in the payment?  And the we need to do a graph with these two curves:    How much will it cost for the short sellers to buy the shorts back given a specific share price   How much will it cost for the short sellers to delay the payment each day in cumulative  Very capitalist answer, as long as Delaying payment interest < Buying back shorted shares then they will continue this game  They can't buy shorts at 300$, 250$ because that means END OF BUSINESS for them  So they are delaying as much as possible and trying to reduce the share price as much as possible, even if they have to pay millions of interests  their main goal is 1) Having the stock so cheap that when they buy their shorts they ear money 2) If they can't, having to pay back as low as possible     If someone can share the input on this i would be able to draft a data analysis model to try to guess the stock price and the moment when the short might be able to squeeze     DL;DR: hold  \-not a financial advice i'm just a noob

GME AMC Hedge Fund Analysis
Spotted off the interstate in Johnson City, TN!
Keep your shit together retards. My autist ass could have made 500k last week but seeing the camaraderie I held. You better have my back too
Greatest transfer of wealth, you say
To the hedge funds maybe.  You think that holding will make it squeeze. But holding is not enough. The price needs to increase to create a squeeze, so you need to buy.  Last weeks were exceptional. Market makers were unprepared (gamma squeeze) and had to buy stock, which helped increase the price. That won't happen again.  Since market makers won't help your cause (buy), you have to do it yourself. But you all agree that it is priced above fundamental value. So basically you want people to buy an overvalued stock, in the hope that other people buy into an even more overvalued stock.  I was fun while it lasted. I wish the outcome was different and that the price would have gone to $1000+, but the momentum was killed on Thursday.

Reasons why the Fed could not allow the squeeze to happen.
I'll preface with saying there will be no rocket or diamond emojis in the post so if that is what you are here for you can stop reading now lol.  The fed is still fixing the damage done during Feb/Mar/April with things like Unlimited QE, overnight swap rates at just about 0%, adding of liquidity to the markets with the buying of not only bonds but   They are just barely getting it propped up again on bullshit (my opinion they should have let the banks and large corps fail. but that has no relevance on this).  The Fed absolutely could not allow these Market makers to potentially be open to legitimate infinite losses to the point of insolvency.  If the squeeze actually did happen and literally forced one or two MM's / Clearing firms to go under. This would force a huge liquidity problem in the overall markets with Market Makers having to sell off their other existing positions which pretty much keep the market propped up at the moment. There are not many of these MM's so if even one failed it creates a huge systemic risk.  These companies are required to figure out worst cast scenarios like this. So if they are required to figure out the worst case the Fed also knows what the worst case is.   It would be the literal un-doing of everything the fed has done up to this point. Do you see how many transactions companies like citadel clear? Who would step in to take the place of them if they went under?  Yes I'd absolutely love that to happen because we would get huge discounts on pretty much any value stock we wanted with the mass sell off like in Feb/Mar/Apil. But do you for one second think the fed would actually let that happen again if it could be prevented ahead of time.  Call me a tinfoil hat if you want because maybe this is a little far fetched but I wouldn't be surprised if the fed actually played an active roll in preventing the squeeze from happening by offering suggestions and advice to the companies involved in all of this. They saved the banks in 2008, they saved them again in 2020, why would they not save them this time.  I just don't see a way this would have ended well for the markets as a whole with everything that has been going on after the black swan that was corona. So how could they possibly allow that to happen.

How can we counter the "ladder attack"?
I'd like to think I'm on the higher end of the spectrum.... But then I remind myself that I am here and that I have yolo-ed my life savings into GME thinking I'd finally be able to get myself out of this hole and buy a moderate house.   It's been a rough couple of days for a lot of us who are involved in GME in one way or another. I'm used to seeing red after being involved in many trades that went sideways (down) since 2004 when I started trading.  The internet community was not as ... Versed back then. It was a little harder to get the information you needed.  That brings me full circle to where we are now.  Something doesn't sit right with me with this whole situation. Not just because my account is red with too many commas. But because I keep hearing that "these" people have these "powerful computers" that can do things we cannot do.  I don't believe that... I can't believe that. Because that goes against everything I know; it goes against everything we are as people, as humans, and üêí. We never give up on the face of adversity, we strive to overcome it no matter how great and difficult... Because that is how we grow, that is how we make our lives and the lives around us better. This is how we make it so the world is a better place for the generations that come after.  So how can we mitigate these "ladder attacks"? What can we do to defeat them? What can we do to use it against them?  I ask this... Because I know many of you out there are a lot smarter than me... A lot more creative... And a lot more knowledge able.  I want to think that this is the way. By collectively solving a problem. This is how we grow isn't it? That is how anyone grows. By reaching out and trying to be better than we were a minute ago.        Cause my account needs it  Edit: I'm drunk and am afraid to look at my portfolio. Excuse the   Incoherent thought.  Edit2: comments are getting deleted. But how are orders prioritized? By cost? Order size? Time?  Edit2: well... Im trying to reply to some of the good comments and questions but it keeps telling me the comment was deleted.    Thank you mods and bots  Edit... Uh... Last: thank you bots and mods. Fucking retarded in here and then some good shit got deleted... Actually a few good things got deleted which makes me slightly concerned.  Anyways... I'm gonna drink more and play some rocket league (RL) cause fuck it.  I hope someone continues this thought process on how to overcome the system. We are smart individually. We are a threat when we can share our knowledge.

I did not partake but watching this on the news and seeing the subreddit logo was great. However, it‚Äôs reached the point where it‚Äôs ruining this sub. Jeff Bezos stepped down and Amazon and Google reported earnings which used to be big days on this sub, but I see nothing but a sea of gme. Thanks for checking out this subreddit but when this gme run ends please post your loss porn so I can beat off and then leave this subreddit. Also the guy who lost 765k today your loss porn was great you can stay. That‚Äôs the yolos this sub was built on not one share of gme bets.

WHY $ELY? Looks like a play....
WHY $ELY NOW?        u/PlatNoFeatures has done some great DD on the stock and that got me looking into it.  I am retarded. I did really good on the whole AMC and GME craze, got cocky, and fucked up everything on horrible calls with no research. Well I won‚Äôt do that again. Now I‚Äôll fuck up money while doing lots of research so I have no excuse and feel even shittier.  I won‚Äôt go into the DD Plat already did, check this for that:    Any way, as you can see from this fucking crayon drawing, now is a good time to buy ELY. The blue curvy line is not just a representation of my floppy dick, but also the 21 adaptive EMA moving average. Stonks love moving average and it‚Äôs about touching now so buy it might be gud idea. It might dip a little below I guess, the average is not a fucking time machine or a crystal ball.  Since December there has been support at around 22-23 dollars, and the resistance is obviously at 30 right now. High end price target is $40 with earnings coming up.  Now im new and obviously retarded so   crayon drawing probably doesnt mean shit but stonks supposedly love the average and we aren‚Äôt way above or below right now. I am highly considering selling everything i‚Äôm bag holding, which will come out to between 700-800 if I sold everything tomorrow no matter what lol and going in on calls.  That‚Äôs obviously not a big move for shares and I want to build the base up so calls it will most likely be. I have one 2/19 $31c right now at $  premium. Probably go for 30‚Äôs if I ‚Äúyolo‚Äù on this. I know it‚Äôs small money for now, fuck you im paying tuition.  One thing that is concerning is volume is low, but if wsb autists get on board, maybe we can do something.  Looking at RSI on the bottom and comparing to price vs average in the next pic, we see that it doesn‚Äôt appear to be overbought right now, further indication to try and get in around or slightly lower than today‚Äôs close        This is obviously not financial advice. Someone convince me to fuck off at 50% loss of initial investment on GME and AMC (including 2/19 calls for AMC) and go all in on this instead‚Ä¶.you fuckers would love to see me blow up the account anyway.  EDIT: It's a fucking drive shack near me, not topgolf. Point stands, these types of venues pack the fuck out (even in pandemic)   Options profit at $  premium x 5 $30c 2/19 for fun:         Some famous golf dude using the gear so you know it‚Äôs the shit:
Amarin DD
The company name is thought to mean everlasting or from the sea depending on who you believe. Both are quite right. Vascepa is icosapent ethyl... a purified and modified omega-3 that when taken on top of a statin (think Lipitor) basically cuts your risk of dying, having a heart attack, or a stroke by 25%.  Sounds good right? Lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until Humira. Yet it started out slow in its first year just like   without a pandemic. Now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily. Lipitor had its run though. Just ask Pfizer. And it still sells tons of cabbage. But there is only one Vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk. Funny thing  ‚Äôs not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the     stokes, stents, open heart bypass   DEATH!!!   There are many different oils, or properly called fatty acids, in those over the counter omega-3‚Äôs you may take. But only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to Work. At least two of the others, DHA and DPA likely actually hurt!!!!! No one really knows why. We think it‚Äôs it‚Äôs powerful anti-inflammatory properties of 100% icosapent ethyl or EPA (Vascepa).  Think.....‚Äúit coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb‚Äù. For reference see the New England Journal of Medicine article from 2018 called the REDUCIT study. Also see the EVAPORATE study from 2020 that showed coronary artery plaque regression. That‚Äôs right...Vascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries!!!!   Let that sink in a minute. There are two large Covid-19 studies reporting in first half of this year called MITIGATe and PREPARE‚ÄîIT. Prepare-It will likely read out end of Feb. Mitigate interim around May. The thought is the anti inflammatory power of V helps. One Canadian study presented in December at the national lipid association showed statistics better than Remdesivir. Vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from Covid!!!!  It may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped   guessed   acids and lipids.  Let that sink in a minute.   Amarin won the FDA approval for CVT reduction in Dec 2019. She hit $26 soon after. March 30, 2020 a Nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over 500 to treat pancreatitis, thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to AMARIN‚Äôs three billion a year US market (when   only a year in). More than 90% of Vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular   for the skinny label treatment of   pancreatitis. The money is in the CVT risk   statin patients world wide. AMARIN spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market. And now generics want to try and steal it all. So far so good except for the market perception. AMARIN claims to have the API sources secured.   Thus far there is one generic made by HICKMA. The company that won the court case. Litigation is still ongoing and AMARIN is now suing them for infringing on the CVT indication patents that are still quite valid. Damages could be huge!!!!   Amarin won EU recommendation for the CVT indication in Europe on Friday and can start marketing likely by April. Europe‚Äôs market is maybe 50% larger than the US. Thus far Amarin has maintained the US market with Hickma currently holding 6% of the market. Yet the stock cratered from $26 to $4 in March. Today she sits just over $8. The drop was likely because all thought the US market was completely toast. Clearly it is not 4 months post generic launch. Add to this that Lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega-3 market and there really is no good reason to ever take Lovaza now that Vascepa is here, and you can see that AMRN‚Äôs revenues are going to be huge. Last year was unaudited $611 mill. 1 billion tax loss carry over. 550 million in cash or investments. No debt. Zero debt...... Price currently $    There seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the March debacle. Despite that she has doubled. That the company updated its ‚ÄúChange of control‚Äù package and policy in an 8-k filed this Friday, one day after European approval recommendation could mean a Buy Out is imminent. Amarin was built for a buy out. She a one drug pony, but the drug is a doozy. I truly believe US can generate $1 bill in sales. EU $3 billion a year. Approval in China by Amarin partner could generate $5 bill a year but AMARIN gets a straight high teens royalty from Eddingpharm ( the Chinese owned partner)   Long story short, this drug saves lives and WILL make a lot of money. Last I looked there were 22 mill shares short. With float of 386 million but much more than half the float is locked up. The daily shenanigans need to stop. The respect and eyes of the world needs to be on Vascepa!!!! It‚Äôs truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits. I honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on Vascepa and we will soon know. Let‚Äôs see what happens when the PEOPLE get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in 50 years proven scientific discovery. I bet she deservedly goes gangbusters and MOST IMPORTANTLY   HOLDS her gains. There won‚Äôt be a find a chair when the music stops here.  Your consideration is appreciated.

Is that all you‚Äôve got?
You‚Äôre scared. You‚Äôre having to calculate if you can cover instead of how much you‚Äôd be spending. They want you to feel that way.  ‚ÄúThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.‚Äù That saying is true. The market is acting irrationally. If there‚Äôs <90% of the volume being traded, and the price is low, is that rational? No.  Is it rational that hundreds of thousands to millions of WSB degenerates decided to put their hard earned money on GME? In a lot of ways, no.  Is it rational to think we can go to the moon? Well, because VW did this and hedgie boi did that? It‚Äôs irrational. Of course it can happen. Cuban said it in his AMA, if you believe the reason you‚Äôre in is because of something true, then stay in. Hold. But the dip. The collective memetards here can push back the onslaught of the hedgies and not only save GME but show them what we‚Äôre made of.   Is this backed by any sort of logic or math or pattern? No. Because this isn‚Äôt logical, mathematical, or a pattern. I like the stock(s). We like the stock(s). It‚Äôs not over. The news cycle moved on because they‚Äôve never held onto anything of value for any period of time anyway. They‚Äôll be back when the stock is at the moon.   Liftoff

Am I doing this right? Still holding cause I bought a damn ticket on this
Why it might not be best to buy the dips for GME:
Right now we are in trench warfare. The shorts and WSB (with some whales and institutional supports) are fighting neck and neck, but why?   The shorts want to bankrupt GME, we know that won‚Äôt happen because this company has Ryan Cohen as ceo.   The shorts want to bring the price down as low as they can, but we keep buying the dips. If I‚Äôm honest, THE SHORTS ARE WINNING RIGHT NOW, but the short interest is still high, so they have to cover.   #WE ARE SPENDING OUR CAPITAL BUYING THE DIPS, WHEN WE SHOULD HOLD OUR SHARES NOW, LET THE PRICE TANK, THEN BUY UP EVEN MORE SHARES   Would you rather buy 3 shares for 80 a piece, just for the shorts to attack again tomorrow and the next day, day after day, or do you want to ‚Äúlet them‚Äù win, let the price tank, then buy up even more shares before they can cover?   Spending 240 on 3 shares, or spending 240 on 24 shares at 10$ a piece WHILE eating up the available shares? I know which one sounds better to me.        #THE SHORTS PLAN    There‚Äôs a very plausible theory that the shorts want to bring the price down very cheaply, then they will buy far OTM calls, and trigger the squeeze themselves. Then once at the top they‚Äôll buy puts and tank the price again.    This allows them to   #Cover   #Make money on the upswing   #Make money on the downswing   #Possibly erase all of their losses and retain their investor base     #TLDR: let the shorts drive the price down, DONT BUY THE DIP, just hold your shares you have now. And with your remaining capital watch the price tank, then snatch up 10x the amount of shares you would be able to during a normal dip.   #PLAY INTO THEIR HAND AND LET THEM THINK THEY‚ÄôVE WON AND THAT WE GAVE UP. THEN THATS WHEN SHARES BECOME AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO SNATCH UP CHEAPLY.
Take a break and rest your mind
Disclaimer: i got 8 GME at $189 DCA  OK there is lots of echo and sharing of loss porn for jerk off purposes.   Truth is for those of us still holding, checking the sub every 1 min for validation does not help. In 2020 when i ate a bag of dicks on indexes futures (yes i kno mirror finish brain) i kept checking the subs and my broker app.   Guess what it made me more worried and panic sold some longs (Mercado Libre at $500, CCL at $12 i got in at $8, sigh) i also got distracted from family which is time no tendies can make up for.  So if you made the commitment to   ü§ö it then just don‚Äôt think about it and do other stuff to keep your mind off. Afterall you should be in cash position and know why you bought it. I did it because i see value and the advantage of short squeeze gang. Right or wrong I won‚Äôt let my time be wittled and get anxious over it.   TLDR: Trust your own gut on why you buy, set you price target and go to sleep off the apps.  ü¶ßüêíüí™üèª ü§ö ü™ê

DO NOT SELL RETARDS GME TO THE TOP
For #GME/#AMC holders/baggers...  What‚Äôs about to happen is trick the system, it is illegal but you stand to lose a couple million in a lawsuit vs billions in your bad shorting stocks.   The hedge fund hatches a plan. Market markers and hedgefund friends are going to use stocks that they own and trade them very very quickly with each other at low low prices. The supply is still low, they are only trading a couple hundred or thousand stocks, but the system can‚Äôt recognize that its the same stocks being traded. Its just seeing the amount of times the same stock is being traded. So one stock being moved 5 times the system, sees as 5 different stocks, and therefore think the supply is high.   Thing is, this only drives the price down. It doesn‚Äôt matter though, since you as someone who is holding isn‚Äôt selling at that price. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the price is at if no one is selling. See, the price decrease because the same stocks are being traded constantly tricking the system into thinking its multiple stocks being traded once, however since the price is too low for the people who are holding the other stocks they are not selling. The supply is still low.   Why is this important? It is important because the hedge funds need to buy your stocks to close their positions. They literally cannot close their shorts unless they buy your stocks. This is why you are supposed to hold your stocks, no matter how low the price is. The price is a facade, they want you to sell at a price they are setting. If you are not selling even though the price is low, they cant buy. If they can‚Äôt buy, they can‚Äôt close their shorts. If they can‚Äôt close their shorts, they‚Äôll have to pay interest. And if the interest becomes too much, they are going to be forced to buy your stocks at whatever price you offer. This is the squeeze.   The squeeze starts when the hedge fund can‚Äôt afford to trick the system anymore since the interest on their shorts are getting too much. They‚Äôll have to pay whatever we ask of them. If no one sells until 1000usd, they are going to be forced to pay that. If no one sells until 10000usd, they‚Äôll have to pay that amount instead. When they are forced to close their positions, they will flood the marketplace with orders to buy. This is going to skyrocket the stocks, and the price will keep rising until people start selling. However, if you sell during the short ladder attacks, the squeeze wont happen. The price set during the attacks isn‚Äôt the actual price. It‚Äôs the price thats tricked into the system.   This is why you HOLD no matter how much the price goes down. If everyone holds, there is no supply and if there is no supply it doesn‚Äôt matter how low the price is SINCE THERE IS LITERALLY NO ONE FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS TO BUY FROM so they can‚Äôt close their positions, they‚Äôll have to keep paying for the interest and at some point, they WILL have to BUY YOUR STOCKS no matter the price.

I posted this on the State of the Union but thought it deserved it's own post: Do we have the power (money) to group together to invest in early funding rounds for companies pre IPO/Direct Listing?
I was thinking about IPOs and Direct Listings, we don't even get to play with the new toys at all before they've all picked the bones clean, if we could somehow band together in such a way that there are enough of us interested in any one new company we have enough to buy a shared stake that'd be amazing  I'm not talking about something like ARKK, or even a democratic fund where members put all into one pot and vote on what to buy, i'm talking about however many of us want to go into AirBnB early can pool funds and buy just that, or into PLTR early before direct listing so each pot is separate, but big enough to sit at the high table,  So companies will come to WSB with their early funding rounds!! This is true parity!

I read Biden‚Äôs National Strategy for the covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness. There‚Äôs a ton of language in there about ‚Äústrengthening essential data systems‚Äù. There is also an acknowledgment that such task may ‚Äúrequire new technology‚Äù.  Some relevant language from strategy:  ‚ÄúDirects relevant federal agencies to collect, produce, share, analyze, and collaborate with respect to data supportive of COVID-19 response and recovery efforts.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAssist localities that struggle with public health infrastructure challenges that limit effective reporting or managing of COVID-19 data. The federal government will focus on states and localities that continue to struggle with antiquated data systems, especially jurisdictions that have trouble connecting testing laboratories and public health agencies to support case investigation, contact tracing, and support services for isolation of potentially exposed individuals. The federal government will work to surge personnel to assist with manual processes in the near-term and develop data technologies to automate in the long-term.‚Äù  Where is all this new technology coming from?  üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  In comes CLOV:  THE CLOVER ASSISTANT   You have the exclusive opportunity to use Clover‚Äôs technology, the Clover Assistant. The Clover Assistant is designed by doctors for doctors to help enhance patient care and reduce administrative burden. We take advantage of Clover Health‚Äôs expansive data platform to deliver actionable and clear information, taking into consideration unique, patient-specific clinical data, needs, and circumstances. With a personalized design that focuses on proactive care, the Clover Assistant synthesizes and analyzes each patient‚Äôs information and makes real-time, personalized, dynamic, evidence-based recommendations right at the point of care.   ALSO read around and found that there have been a few bills introduced in congress over the past few months around data and privacy related to health.   What do I think?  1. Biden = healthcare and he‚Äôs looking to score big there. This will be a focal point. You know ThE fIrSt 1o0 dAyS  2. The language in Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs bill is super specific about protections on how patient data is stored, anonymized, and shared. Okay...   3. Pharmacy‚Äôs partner up with fed for covid vaccination and the day before clover issued a statement around getting covid vaccines.    4. Now all of that sounds great. However, why the sudden rush to introduce bills that are clearly addressing a concern around patient‚Äôs health data? It raises all sorts if questions for me like:  Who‚Äôs collecting this data that you‚Äôre so worried about its use and privacy?  Where are these concerns coming from? What is it that we are protecting ourselves from? Is that not weird y‚Äôall? Anyway, I guess the point there is that there is clearly some big push to collect and use our patient data by the government (pretty scary imo). Plus you know, google backed Clover. Which leads me to believe, based on the language around new technology in Biden‚Äôs initiative, that they are going to have to acquire this technology from somewhere. Where from though?    Anyway, I‚Äôm excited to see how this narrative plays out in the coming weeks and months. Healthcare is a heavy political space, especially under Biden. Based on recent news, something is brewing. Too many coincidences lining up.    The Proverbial           Sources here:
GME and $80 Stocks. Why to not worry.
>Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!  Wrong.  No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:   PRICE DOESN'T MATTER   >WHAT?!  You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.  They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a "30 cent stock" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked.  They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.  It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.  All the activity driving down the listed share price are  illegal ladder attacks  (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed).  You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.  We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.  I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:   PRICE DOESN'T MATTER   So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:    # of Shares - Price    x 20 - $   x 80 - $5  x 400 - $20  x 600 - $40  x 900 - $60  x 2,000 - $100  x 5,000 - $150  x 10,000 - $200  x 30,000 - $300  x 50,000 - $400  x 150,000 - $500  x 1 mil - $1,000  x 15 mil - $5,000  x 30 mil - $69,420  Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (  of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point.  A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices . If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.  Get it?   PRICE DOESN'T MATTER   They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.  This isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation.

Forget Memes do some DD retards!
Ok everyone for past few days we‚Äôre getting lot of memes and it‚Äôs great I love them personally but we need some serious DD now.  Like do your research and share with us. Today I found there is a thing call Dark Pool trading when I read about it my mind was blown.  It‚Äôs basically big hedge fund selling shares to another big hedge fund to bring the price down can anyone confirm if I said it right?  That being said cmon people time to buckle up for this ride to the moon but let‚Äôs do some research and post it here.   Thanks for listening to my pep talk!  EDIT: What I heard about this Dark pool trading is that this is artificial and they still need to buy our shares, please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. It depends how long big banks let them do their thing before asking interest money back. Also I heard it‚Äôs not just Melvin but few other hedge funds are in this too so let‚Äôs see what happens.

Abolish the PDT RULE
With the microscope on us like never before it is time to raise questions about an issue that has plagued many.  PDT rule only hurts small trades. (A 25k account size minimum for placing more than 3-day trades in 5 trading days)  Intended to help, it only locks traders into bad trades and out of good ones. It hinders account growth for smaller accounts and lets people with more money run free.    Congress and the SEC are all talking about the "retail boom." There is no reason removing or lowering the minimum should not be in that conversation.
It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs honest work. Attempt #2 with helpful red and green squiggles, since apparently no one could read the first one.
Grounded Uncertainty.
Current Position: 160 $GME $  avg, 2x $GME 300c 2/19, 1x GME 800c 2/12  How's it going apes, I've been lurking since the covid market crash, and have recently been seeing a lot of sensible posts that make it seem like the squeeze has squozen, and all of the shorts have been covered. Maybe the media wasn't lying. Maybe the posts are getting into the one wrinkle my smooth brain has left. We'll see.  I'm just posting to see if anyone can reference me to evidence or good DD that can refute some of these ideas, but some of the things aren't adding up.  First things first: This sub has gotten pretty hive mind-y. A lot of the DD posted is grounded in speculation, or the idea that everyone is out to get us and no one is on our side. It's naive, but let's assume no one was lying, and that the media isn't out to get us. They're just lazy and writing easy articles with little to no research for those yummy clicks.  Let's kick this off.  # 1. The Hedgies covered their short positions?  Around the height of the squeeze, the media was claiming that the hedge funds have closed out their short positions. This was refuted by the fact that   poses a really good argument as to why this is possible. Basically, it's saying that the jump to 500 was the squeeze, and they re-opened shorts at a better position. That was us winning, the hedge funds cut their losses. We interpreted that as them "Doubling Down". Now we're the bagholders, and this "war of attrition" will be us slowly selling our shares as more and more of us realize that the game is over.  # 2. Volume! No one is selling! Look at the volume spike and the price spike this morning!  The price spike this morning was the gamma squeeze. The seller of the contract has T+2 days to deliver the shares. They obviously waited for the share price to be as low as possible, because they knew the squeeze was over. We're against people who have much more money and education in this field. Why would they not try to maximize their profits as well? I don't think holding does anything but decrease liquidity. The people buying isn't them, it's us.  # 3. DFV didn't sell! Mark Cuban said to hold!  I haven't actually dug through post / comment history, so correct me if I am wrong. But I think DFV is in it for the long haul, he  genuinely  likes the stock. I don't think his plan was to make a quick buck off of a squeeze. And Mark Cuban said to hold  if you believed in the company , he said not to sell if your reason for buying hasn't changed. Well, if the squeeze squoze, would that not be the reason changing? I didn't see him reference the squeeze itself, and whether or not we were winning. Rather,  we did the right thing.      I hate to be a debbie downer, but I don't drink and I am sober enough to see the party's over. We won, kind of. I'm still balls deep, diamond handing on a wish that GME takes off to the moon. I just need some reassurance, because all the DD in the past couple days hasn't been grounded enough to convince me that we're still in for a ride. Whatever happens, we're in this together.     I'm not fuckin' selling....     yet.
Bought 900 More Shares of AMC Today- Thanks paper hands, keep giving me a deal, I‚Äôll keep buying. I lock the stock, I like theatres, and it‚Äôs gonna be nice being able to afford $10 popcorn
Dealing with life changing losses (yolo still balls deep in GME and never selling)
After riding a big green dildo around the last few weeks, I finally lost all my gains and more as I kept doubling down on dips. I‚Äôm still holding shares but have lost all of money. You may think I‚Äôm a retard for gambling with more than I could lose. You are absolutely right, am retarded. However, I think it‚Äôs important we draw attention to this, yes it‚Äôs the institutions fault for stealing our gains by manufacturing an impossible to win playing field. But at the same time it‚Äôs important to turn inward and ask oneself- why monke so retarded, why monke have one banana when monkey had 6 banana. Basically I‚Äôm a stupid monke who refuses to let go his last banana. But this sub didn‚Äôt always used to be like this. Will GME still moon? If we are tactical and precise and stronk    , I can see it happening if we really focus our efforts and communication. Yea it‚Äôs fun to spam but there‚Äôs so many damn bots and ways of deceiving and diverting us. For those of us who lost money they weren‚Äôt prepared to lose so quickly- please get actual help by reaching out to loved ones and fellow   . You don‚Äôt need to tell everyone irl about your losses, in fact don‚Äôt, but find one maybe two people who can support you during these times. Personally I reached out to my   dad because I‚Äôm so autistic I got him to go in on GME too. He‚Äôs a boomer so he paper handed but he still has gains. I do not anymore. But I am holding on for something greater at this point. So if this resonates with anyone please feel free to tell your story below. I‚Äôm down $30k on GME and still holding.. let‚Äôs keep the dream alive but make sure not to lose our head along the way. Also we can write this off in our taxes and become better traders in the future. It will all make sense soon enough and when GME moons, tomorrow, Thursday, or even if it takes months, we will finally do as the tendieman once said- take our gains and go. Goodnight sweet chimps ü¶ß ‚ú®
Dear Secretary Yellen
If you truly do believe in the integrity of the markets as well as fair and efficient markets. Than why were multiple brokerages allowed to stop and or limit the trading of GameStop stock for us little guys but hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, Point72, Citron, Citadel, etc were still allowed to participate in full force and manipulate the price of GameStop in their favor and still are allowed to multiple days later while trading is still limited for retail investors.  Also, can you please explain how these hedge funds which offer zero benefit to society are allowed by you to counterfeit shares so that upwards of 130% of every GameStop share ever invented was sold short? In addition, I am curious how the short sellers are able to cover their shorts if many of us 7,000,000 wallstreetbets users have never sold our shares back to anyone? I‚Äôm no detective but that math does not add up.
Final Boss Fight. It's happening tomorrow with Yellen, SEC and Federal Reserve. Emeegency meeting to talk about GME volatility.
Guys, it's happening. They know they are screwed.  Yellen is having an emergency meeting tomorrow OR the day after with the SEC heads, Federal Reserve, Federal Bank, Bank of New York and the CFTC and the meeting is about Gamestop Volatility!!!             "What volatility?" I'm sure you're asking.    THE ONE COMING FROM THE SQUEEZE. They are mega fucked. Today only around   of float GME remains. There is sufficient real research on this sub that shows that we are ACTUALLY diamond handing.  THAT   WILL GET GOBBLED UP IN NO TIME WITH OUR RETARDED GME BUYING.        On another note, some people's sell limit at   and 5k got filled today for 1 single GME share on this sub.               Thesis:    Goldman Sachs and the big boys have deleveraged their stake in GME and said they are reducing risk while also calling what already happened as the squeeze and that other hedges deleveraged as well. I can't tell if this is FUD or if they truly believe this. This info is in their daily customer subscription mailers, only actual GS customers get these mailers afaik. I don't know what is the truth anymore.  If Yellen wants to meet for volatility on a fizzling stock that is   ish locked in by buyers, this screams all kinds of alarms in my head. They are either going to try and stop the party or they are looking for money to pay us and not crash everything at the same time.  Tomorrow is the final fight. Yellen and all the bigwigs are the bosses.  Also i think it makes sense for the squeeze to happen this week before Friday due to the naked short puts the HFTs have been selling that are likely 2/05 of expiry. They DO NOT want this squeeze to happen next week when all those shorts are gone and the price is back way up. They also don't want the squeeze to happen on Friday due to the extreme volatility due to their naked 2/05 puts.  If all that makes sense, this means that the squeeze is coming tomorrow or the day after and NOT next week or this Friday.     If none of this happens, Cohen still has this smoking gun to trigger it.        Final words.      \-Set your sell limits.   \-SET YOUR SELL LIMITS.   \-YES YOU.   \-FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS STRAIGHT.   \-There's SOME consensus on the sub that realistically it should be \~800. Add a few lottos at 5k and 10k too as some people were lucky to get filled on   and 5k today. Don't get too greedy or you might not fill.      Good luck retards.
Why this fight isn't over: they want to shake you out, high or low.
The thesis is forming in my head now... We've seen how much the MM can manipulate anything... A lot of people believe the lies--the official reports--I've finally resigned to the feeling that I know I'm being lied to... That the enemy still has something at stake here, and that we can profit from it.  This is how the lord of lies works; he relies on you to do what is rational, because facts are the only thing the lord of lies can control...  So, what we've seen isn't a paying down of shorts...  It's the MM manipulating the price to convince you to fold your hand... They put it up to see if you'll cash in... They'll put it down to see if you'll cash out...  I think there will be a big squeeze soon--but the reason won't be because of fundamentals--it will be because the last squeeze didn't get you to fold your hand.  The big question is: why do they have to play against our hand of they can cheat? What we do know is that a lot of shares are coming back with a "failure to deliver"--meaning these MM are injecting fake shares into the economy; this is all we've known until now...  Another question is: who holds the real shares, and who holds the fake shares?  But where is the thesis about how these fake shares can be used? And why?  For the sake of this thesis, I have to assume that the MM are accountable to the SEC, the government or the banking systems at large\~\~so, if we're to see news break of this, and trials had, it will have to be because the MM couldn't kick the can any further down the road, and their lie was exposed... üì∑  There are a lot of people involved in this whole chain of operations. Some people are able to collude together, but the system as a whole can't be all in on one conspiracy together...  What I expect to see, weeks from now at most, is that the MM are exposed, for who they are, and what they're doing--hopefully entirely--and that we'll be closer to exposing the perfidy that has unfolded underneath of us.  There's a reason none of us feel right... Why we feel uneasy, and like we've been cheated--we saw it right before our eyes, and we're gaslighted--and then it all blew over, like everything is normal...  But we still see signs of the fight brewing underneath.     Read this person's post. He talks in depth about "failure to deliver" shares... There's a piece missing to this puzzle, and it isn't to do with how much short interest is left...  We keep seeing them pay that down and rebuying into shares for a reason...  There's manipulation there. Probably them manipulating the short interest to combat this narrative that there will be a short squeeze.     This guy might be on to something... Something feels like it's missing... I guess my gut says a squeeze can still happen. My mind is fighting me.  So, they're going to hike the price again perhaps end of this week... They'll try to shake you out at $1,000 a share.  This is the thesis... What happens at the end of this?  I don't know.

Alrite You Lennys... Let's Talk Non-Squoze DD...
For everyone stuck holding a $400 share and wondering where this goes from here... (Why aren't you cost averaging down?)  Let's look at GameStops current metrics.  GameStops current market cap at $90 is $   On last earnings, GME reported $1bil in revenue with -$18mil in net income.  They made $1,000,000,000 in revenue in 3 months, and they need to save $18,000,000 per quarter to turn a profit. Any improvements they make to the operations is going to keep pushing them farther into the green. They couldn't do much worse than last year with the pandemic...    instead they are about to have their largest quarter in recent history. Hear me out...  Between the dual-release of the PS5 and the XBOX, console sales will be a huge boost. But that is expected...  The other new market that no one is discussing is Trading Cards. Pokemon and Magic TCG both had a HUGE year. With card shops being shut down, a very large amount of sales went through GameStop because scalpers were clearing out big box retailers.  And GameStop takes pre-orders for them.  My local GameStop put a limit on 20 pre-orders per person so that they could try to guarantee allocation. 20 per customer... And they had to limit it...  GameStop has extra cash in the bank from the PreOrders for the next Shiny Vault Pokemon set coming out... So they actually have cash on the books in advance for this upcoming earnings report. You're going to see a huge surprise.  Their new partial owner, Ryan Cohen, took Chewy up against Amazon and won. And he brought his best team with him to GameStop. GameStop did 35% of their revenue through online sales in October. Wait until RC streamlines it and builds a market around the brand name recognition...  So ask yourself...  Does a $6bil cap company with $1bil in Quarterly Revenue (quarterly...), on the cusp of turning a profit, and with the best online sales team in the market sound like a decent investment to you?  Because that is what GameStop at $90 is...  Hold on my fellow Lennys. The long term looks good from here. $100 is going to be a floor soon. Sky's the ceiling...  Even without a squeeze...   ‚ù§  üëä
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to call regulator meeting on GameStop volatility, seeks ethics waiver
Federal law requires reporting of short positions
So this is something I just found out about, and I thought everyone else might be interested as well.  Remember how it's a giant mystery as to who has had a short position on gme and we were just going off a rumor mill for months that it was Melivin (well until Melvin publicly reported almost going out of business).  So it turns out since 2010 when the Dodd-Frank act was signed into law investing managers have been required to to disclose short positions, just like they do their longs.  The SEC just chooses not to implement this.  Considering naked short attacks are what took down the banks in '08 turning that mess into a crisis, it's crazy the SEC doesn't have to respect federal law.  The law itself is giant, but there's also a bunch of public comments on the SEC site encouraging them to actually do their job:        If anyone is interested in suggesting they actually implement 929x from the Dodd-Frank Act there's a page on sending in public comments:
Just letting you retards know I‚Äôm still not selling
CEo s3 claiming GME shorts were covered on FRIDAY. Remember the price friday? Smells like a conspiracy to misinform the public.
Comfort in uncertain times..  ü§≤ $GME - We love the stock.
" The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy." -     Sun Tsu - The Art of War           The above is fitting in so many ways, as are many other famous quotes from a long time ago... We may be in a modernized digital world, but the fundamentals remain the same.  This is a long post, and I apologize but rather than just join the echo chamber, and shout  ü§≤  etc.. Let's take a minute and really assess where we're at and where we've come from. This IS NOT telling ANYONE to üìÑü§≤ .. Quite the opposite in fact.  As it stands I bought at $325, the night shit really turned pear shaped (on paper) and I watched the initial investment jump up to just short of $500.. I was grinning about it, thinking I'd timed it just right..  Moments later, the market was halted, share buying restricted, prices began to plunge.  And continue to plunge.. day after day.  I have then watched the shit storm unfold between then and now, but I've learnt a BUNCH and become almost addicted to wanting to know more.       KNOWLEDGE IS POWER          We have all heard this a MILLION times in our lives, but it's true. And the more you educate yourself about this current situation, regardless of how it resolves, the more it will help us all in the future. This is just the beginning.  The market will not be the same after this, the SEC investigators, super autistic apes, politicians, billionaires, people from ALL walks of life, and levels of varying smooth brains will look further into this and explain clearly how it all went down. Lap the knowledge up. It will help you in the future as part of WSB or solo.. it   WILL   help.  I mean fuck. Netflix is already making a movie. People will be talking about this for a long time yet as the trade that changed how Wall Street does business. (I agree with all the others too.. give them a happy ending!  ü§≤)  What I'm getting at is this kind of fuckery with the ladder attacks, the blatant FUD   on the media, the bots, the busted brokers, trolls and everything else that has been thrown against you is you learned.  You learned what Wall Street is capable of, what they will stoop to, what to expect next time, how they are doing this, the tactics they use.. And just for a second, place yourself in their shoes.  The big guys have the lifestyle that many of you can only dream about, and if you have that.. you will do \ ANYTHING\  to protect it. The rich don't get rich by being charitable, and sharing their wealth freely with the smaller guys. They get rich by TAKING, USING, and ABUSING and employing any tactic they can to their advantage to achieve their end goal of financial domination.       We're different.       For the first time, in the history of the internet we  have come together - People say it could have been any company.. But think about this:  GameStop (EB Games for us Aussies) is a place where you STILL go, regardless of Steam, Epic (yuck), GOG, and all the other online retailers..  GameStop shutting its doors, would be similar to when the old arcades (Time Zone excluded..) shut their doors, and became a thing of the past.  How many times have you walked through a shopping center and stopped in to your local GameStop or EB Games and browsed for a gift for a loved one, a quirky new shirt, the pre-owned console games, D&D stuff.. The list goes on.    GameStop is still relevant   \- And by the luck of the gaming gods   $GME   was the share that the big brains ( Yes, people like /r/deepfuckingvalue ) spotted and deemed to be a good investment.     Now, think further along - If the stocks were something mundane... like   Gourds   (Fuck off copy pasta bots.. you're mildly annoying and none of us care. We enjoy clicking the üí© reactions on your repetitive, shitposts)  Do you think the online community would have rallied and banded together internationally to support it? Fuck no.  This is a magical, rare, fucking unicorn of a stock. It's circumstances, and nature of the company tied into a neat little package for us to love and hold.. (forever  ü§≤)  We are gamers, we are tech savvy, we have the ability to open broker accounts online without any previous experience, we know how to research more than just using Google, we are the perfect audience to start a global movement. Which we have done.  So when the whispers of WSB began, and word slowly began to spread around the interwebs, you guys heard it. You took the time to investigate.. and shit post a lot.. and come up with almost a whole new sub culture lingo to go with it (Okay, maybe WSB had that for a long time before the new arrivals.. but we love it)  The point is, you spent time, learned and I implore you to keep learning until that smooth brain.. isn't so smooth.  # We are the perfect demographic and GME is the perfect stock for us and those two factors have lead us to a point where the entire world, gamers or not have become involved. This. Is. Huge.  Right now there is a lot going in our favour -   Do not judge this epic event by the share price alone.     Initially I wanted to post pics, graphs, explanations about everything you can readily find online so you would be educated, so you would know that this isn't over yet, far from it in fact. But, the more I look around, the more I see people who just need a nudge to investigate things themselves.        REMEMBER: KNOWLEDGE IS POWER       Due Diligence is needed. Invest only what you can afford or risk. No-one can tell you specifically what is best for you so RESEARCH that smooth brain.  Check out the posts already in here:     \-- Great for explaining some of the tactics and thought processes of the other side.    \-- A fairly well researched graph to show how they aggressively ladder attacked us.    \-- A good post about shorts    \-- A good post about Gamestop in general and how even if you \ FEEL\  like you've lost it all at the moment.. Hold. The company is far from done, and will experience growth despite this, the shorts, ladder attacks.. all of it. If you believe in the company then holding regardless is the key.     \-- A literal BILLIONAIRE .. telling you if you can afford it, hold.     I could post a 1000 more links to posts, comments and people doing epic DD, whether they came from a financial background or are just a smooth brain ape who's taken the time to look deeper into it all.. but you get my point.  If you have decided to  ü§≤ and     to the moon with us (in a week, a month, a year..) then unless you're buying..       Put down your phone, stop watching the ticker, and do some research while you hold.       Because once the dust settles, and the war is won.. We will move on and find some other greedy assholes and right their wrong. The more smart apes we have, the better it will be next time around.     Thank you for your time, go educate yourself more, it's free and empowering.   ü§≤ until the end. I just like this stock.  Not financial advice.

A Monologue On Why AMC Will Survive...
Alright listen up you retards, for those of you who don't know AMC is just about the best damn stock on Robinhood right now. You may be thinking what about GameStop, well you're just a f       autistic child living in his mother's basement... forget about GameStop, that squeeze was "squoze".  This is why AMC is going to be the next best thing since sliced bread: All of the other movie theater companies had already filed for bankruptcy. This leaves AMC Theatres as The Last Man Standing. They just raised over $700M in additional funding which clears them of any short-term bankruptcies up coming ü§ë  There is an enormous amount of pent-up demand for entertainments especially Sports and movies. Where is everyone going to go once things go back to normal? They're going to go to the only place left in town and that's AMC üèöüèöüè†  Well you may be thinking "This stock was $3 a month ago why should I buy it at $7?" Because    autists are holding those bags up baby, just buy now or cry later.   AMC is seen as a value stock versus Gamestop considering the inflated valuations. Dollar for dollar youre better off buying the cheaper of the two, for unit bias and also because...  What you can do with your shares while waiting: 1)  Write covered calls for every 100 shares you own - Implied Volatility is something most of you cant even spell so don't worry about what it means, it just means $$$ when writing calls. 2) Make dinner for your wife's boyfriend. He worked up quite an appetite this evening.   TLDR:   BUY $AMC   It's going to the moon this year
So in order to have GME buy restrictions lifted...
(If we forget the conspiracies and follow their rules)  The daily fund requirements brokers have to deposit with their clearing houses increased because GME was too volatile and because there were way more buys than sells at popular brokers.   Does it mean that if, hypothetically, buyers :  - spread their buys on multiple days/weeks, in order to lower volatility  - move some of the GME stocks they already have from the most popular brokers to other less exposed brokers, in order to lower the quantity of GME held by the more popular brokers and also to make room for newer investors who tend to use popular platforms   Then brokers would be in the clear and could lift restrictions? Is that right? Hypothetically, feasible?

Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and hold
Every other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit.   To all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong.   I‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn‚Äôt sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples.   I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I‚Äôm holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it‚Äôs too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin‚Äôs mistake? No actual hedging. Don‚Äôt be a Melvin. .   A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I‚Äôve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days.   But I don‚Äôt give a fuck.   Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren‚Äôt the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on.   It‚Äôs not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we‚Äôre in dire straits probably didn‚Äôt comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the ‚ÄúGolly I could‚Äôve had Apple 20 years ago!‚Äù guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?
Could NOK or GE be an infrastructure play?
Manchin is calling for a 4 Trillion infrastructure play...      I haven't heard any number under 2 trillion for infrastructure... GE (hella cheap options) has turbines but NOK  (also cheap options) has 5G towers... wouldn't it make sense while they are upgrading fiber (which is a big part of infrastructure, upgrading rural internet) to have 5G installed? Along freeways, in rural towns - etc??  Own both GE and NOK on the hopes that infrastructure plays a role in their expansion. I am not a financial advisor - merely asking questions after the absolute carnage over the last few weeks.

Let's talk about taxes: both realized gains and realized losses (USA only)
I know everybody is getting super excited about GME, AMC, NOK, or BB going    , but have you thought about taxes? I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.    LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:    I know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to   REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL  . You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can   only deduct up to $3,000 per year   ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year.   (Please see edit below for losses >$3,000).      CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):    There are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (<=1 year) and long term (>1 year).  Short term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.    Marginal Rates:   For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:    35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);   32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);   24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);   22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);   12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).

How to prevent your $GME shares from being used for short ladder attacks
Fellow apes:  Thanks to   so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:     Stay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!  Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.     Edit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!  Edit 2: I‚Äôve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn‚Äôt make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I‚Äôll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I‚Äôve never had any issues with them, and they don‚Äôt limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.  Edit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can‚Äôt be made. I‚Äôm not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that, it‚Äôs okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.  Edit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to ‚Äúpay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account‚Äù. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I‚Äôm not an expert. For those of you telling me (with malicious intent) that I‚Äôm a retard, tell me something I don‚Äôt know.

I spent some time looking into Failed to Deliver. Hopefully, this is some useful information for all of you!
So the SEC has a failed to deliver report under the FIOA     It looks like it only updates this data bi-monthly for the 1-15 16-30th  and the next report is due out at or around the 15th.  I am going to call the SEC tomorrow and ask for intermediate data.  We need this data NOW.  If you look at this.  GME has failed to deliver a LOT of shares all the time.   When I did some highschool excel Data Analytics on it.  It is the 60th stock on the list when sorted by # of shares.  From the SEC regarding this data  >"The  figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.   In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific   point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's   aggregate fails."        Looking at the above site.  There are links to information about Failed to deliver.   Is GME considered a Threshold Security ‚úÖ  >In  order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the  restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified  fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.   Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold  securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for  a period of five consecutive settlement  days.  Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ‚úÖ  >As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency ("participant") Specifically, the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.   >   >Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.   We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.  So  Dumb-ass me looked further back in time to the second half of  December.  It looks like GME has been failing to deliver CONSTANTLY.   This means that there are shares that Brokers HAVE to buy.  We are over the 10/13 Day limit.  What's going on here.  How can this single security CONSTANTLY fail to deliver almost every day... clearly something is going on here....  How are they CONSTANTLY failing?  Well,  that's because there are shares that are made up, it has to be.  This is shorted STILL beyond belief as of the 15th.        For comparison.  Here is AA.  Notice almost none, clearly not ~~manipulated~~ an issue.        Here is a dumb sorted list by # of shares.        Edit: Positions.  AMC and like 5 shares of GME     Edit2: Removing totals
GME Devil's Advocate (Part 3)... A solid example of managing risk
And now we're here.  It seems that people are blind as a rock when they see DFV's daily GME Yolo Updates.  Do you bother fucking reading anything? Ever? I mean, I get it, I write walls of text... but DFV uploads a single picture and you can't even bother reading that picture... Come on, that's prime savant! You literally cannot be helped if you're one of these people.  Here's what I mean,    by DFV uploaded on Sep 11, 2019.  All other things ignored, do you notice something?   Look at the "CASH" pile. It reads: $13,     Great, remember that fucking number because we're going to progress through this fiasco of "he hasn't sold".  I'm not gonna bother with a daily, or monthly reminder of how great DFV is at risk management. So let's skip a few months and head straight to  .  Notice something odd? Something remarkable?   The cash pile reads $1,105,     Alright, maybe he just added a million more to his account by taking a HELOC against his rented house (how's that possible, I don't fucking know, anything's possible on wsb). But let's extend the usual WSB benefit of the doubt to DFV, because that's the least we can do. We're going to ignore the voice of reason and just say the dude took out 1mill against his mortgage to blow on GME YOLOs.  Cool, let's move on.  Total $  - Cash pile on  : $1,116,   Total $  - Cash pile on  : $1,128,   Total $  - Cash pile on  : $4,840,   Total $  - Cash pile on  : $13,817,   Do you notice a trend, you smooth-brained jizz rocket? I really hope you do.  DFV, time and time again has proven to be a great investor. How could he not be, he hunts VALUE stocks, not YOLOs. His thesis on GME wasn't driven by a squeeze, but rather a company that was being sold on the market for cheaper than it was worth. Watch his videos, and you'll find that.  He just truly stuck by his thesis and the squeeze was the cherry on top of the cake... and while you idiots keep thinking he's not selling because all you read is the "Total pile", you're failing to realize he probably has brilliant stop losses that have taken his $50k to nearly $14m already. And as always, he's letting the rest ride. This is called... letting the winners ride.  You'll also notice his rolling of the options, and I don't know if they are strategic, but they are brilliant. Another indicator of him not being smooth brained.  Now, read his future daily updates carefully. I'm out.    TLDR:   You're a savant, you don't need a TLDR... but I'll try. DFV has cashed out $14m worth of gains, and the top comment is always "If he's still in, I'm still in". In reality, DFV has fucked the game on so many levels, the game now calls him daddy. Rightfully so.  Edit: Spellings
The game is up nobody should be putting money into GME right now
Downvote and call me paperhanded me all you want but I'm off the GME Galactic and i've booked a healthy profit from it.   Not financial advice.   I wrote this on Monday night after selling on Monday morning but i feel the sentiment still holds true.   Back in December when i started GME was at around 16. I averaged up to   last monday but i took out my initial invest when it got up to 447. I sold the rest yesterday at 275. Do i regret not selling when it was 400+? Yes. Am i happy with what i've got? Absolutely.   At some stage WSB becomes an echo chamber and if you get sucked in you're investing/betting on emotion rather than making logical decisions about what to do with your money.   Back in December when /u/uberkikz11 and /u/deepfuckingvalue had their posts up with the  proposition for GME being undervalued it was a compelling case and and threw a bit of money in. Q3 ER came in and the SP tanked but i held because the investment thesis hadn't changed. Last monday i sold nearly everything else i had in my portfolio to put into GME so that at the end it was 77% of my entire holdings which i think was the right decision (YOLOL). But after seeing what happened on Thursday and then doing some reading over the weekend i got worried that the train was slowing and decided to sell everything yesterday.   I don't think that theres anybody who doesn't realise that GME is speculation and if you actually believe that its a good investment i think you're wrong. There was a specific set of circumstances that helped bring GME to where it is now and those circumstances have changed significantly with the limiting of purchasing.   Back to what i said earlier about WSB being an echo chamber. There were 2m-ish people on the sub on Monday. Now? Its at 8m. Its fucking crazy. I'm not some tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist but you have to at the very least believe that different people will have different agendas and this is doubly so for 7m people. You form your own opinions but if everybody is saying buy then its always a good idea to find reasons not to buy so you have a balanced viewpoint. Even DFV himself when posting up his thesis for GME asked people to critique his logic. If you aren't actively seeking out other opinions you're doing yourself a disservice and you risk getting mired in the "HLOD" bog.   Andrew Left's first hitjob video was a hilarious catalyst but he does say one thing that made total sense - know who is on the other side of the trade. WSBers like to convince themselves that we know what high short interest means but do we actually know? Do we know who is on the other side of the GME trade? I'd recommend going to take a look at some of /u/laminar_flo 's posts. While some of his posts come off as very HF elitist he does make some valid points about Wall Street in general and how Melvin might actually have already exited this trade. So back to the question - do we know who's on the other end of this trade? I think with all the HDOL-ing there are some people who can't hack the volatility and are selling so this means that its just retards selling to other retards on the way down. (as an aside i do actually have to commend Citron's second video. I think he realised that by becoming a predatory short himself he actually joined the establishment and didn't want to be part of it).   A lot of people follow what other WSBs do on the sub and DFV is our current god and saviour but saying you're not selling if hes still in is silly. He's sitting on $14m, are you? The thing that worried me over the weekend was seeing people throwing in various funds (retirement, wedding, college fund etc) into this trade expecting it to only go up. Yes stonks go up if there is a solid reason for going up and at this stage nobody know if GME will go up down or sideways. You know the story about the shoeshine boys? People YOLO-ing into stocks without any DD are the current version of those shoeshiners.   On WSB everybody wants to make money but nobody wants to be left holding the bag. Asking others to get in now is irresponsible and people will get hurt from this. The people trying to cajole people to buy the dip or HDLO are essentially asking others to hold the bag while they look for an exit. Don't fall into the trap.   I could absolutely be wrong. If it goes up to 500+ this week or next i'd be happy for you but at the same time i'm happy with what i have. I'm not keen on the volatility and i think there are better trades out there.   What have i learned from this whole thing?  1) Have a target in mind and when you get there consider how you'd like to exit.   2) Don't invest anymore than you can afford to lose.   3) do your own DD. Read more than one opinion get as many facts as you can and then use those to build a gut feeling.

$HSY Valentines Run Up?
Would love some feedback here. I was looking at Hershey and comparing last year. They ran up from $145 at the end of January to $160 by Feb 14.   Retail food sales have been huge all year with big YoY sales. It stands to reason that their sales for the Valentine‚Äôs Day holiday are going to crush last year. Their earnings report is Thursday. Most big box retailers placed their Valentine‚Äôs Day orders weeks if not months ago. So this should show up on their revenue.   Thoughts??
Echo echo echo...
I‚Äôve been in this sub a long time (by WSB standards anyways)   I blew up my first account on tankergang, those dividend loving greek fuckers at (redacted smallcap) really did a number on me. Since then I‚Äôve tried to be smarter, understand my trades better, and profit more consistently.    In the year I‚Äôve been honing my autism, I‚Äôve never seen this place such an echo chamber. There have been plenty of MEMEstock events. NKLA rolling a shell down a hill was probably my favorite followed by the TSLA booty shorts.    There is a place for MEMEstocks here. No question.    That said. The current state of the sub is abysmal.    There is no real DD. Just monkeys repeating what they heard a few minutes ago, spamming    , spamming GME memes, and leading others into folly. Yesterday someone tried to tell me GME OSI was at 140%. That data is over two weeks old at this point, no one should be trusting it as fact.    So this is what I‚Äôm gonna tell all the new people.      stop       with       the       echo       chamber     Without dissenting opinion we are all doomed to fail. Honest, thoughtful discussion should be just as much a staple here as calling each other smooth brains and retards.    If you disagree with a post or comment don‚Äôt just downvote because you don‚Äôt like it, prove the OP wrong with fact and logic. If you can‚Äôt, maybe you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs wrong.    Institutional guys can use what‚Äôs happening here to shape the narrative and fleece retail for years to come if we don‚Äôt being back honest debate.  edit: Don't gild this please. Fuck the CCP shills who own this website. Don't fund their bullshit. Give to your local animal shelter if you feel so inclined.

Been in since 1/25. It's been a bumpy week.
Can someone with a knowledge of prob/stats and portfolio risk management explain to me how two days of volume led DTCC to increase RH's deposit requirement by 10x?
I know this isn't exactly a WSB type of post, but there has to be someone with expertise doing some bedtime reading.    attempting to explain the calculation.  As far as I understand, the situation is like this.  RH needs to maintain an amount of cash (maybe with DTCC, but possibly just separately within RH since they have their own clearing house) that, with 99% probability, will cover the entirety of the cash needed to cover their unsettled T+2 positions.  This is generally much smaller than the actual buy volume on a given day because the amount that's due two days later is max(vol_buy - vol_sell, 0).  Let's call this the net buy volume (NBV).  In a situation where RH is buying and selling in an unbiased way, this would be on the order of sqrt{vol_buy} since sell proceeds offset buy proceeds (not for a particular symbol, but  across the entire portfolio ).  It seems highly unlikely to me that most of the buy volume on Tues/Wed last week was from cash, and not also from sale of equities.  And, moreover, if it was from cash, then in order for the NBV to remain high, it would require a constant influx of cash into RH accounts.  Therefore I assume that the massive increase in deposit requirements actually came from the "99%" requirement and a massive increase in the estimated variance of the NBV on DTCC's part.  But the fucking situation is not symmetrical.  If RH did suddenly adopt a huge net long position (due to users primarily buying $GME), then the volatility to the  sell side  becomes huge, but not the volatility to the buy side.  But a huge move to the sell side is not risky to DTCC.  They want more deposits to protect the net buy side.  This isn't modeled by a normal distribution because the only way to keep having massive NBV is for users to keep depositing proportional equity (since selling other equities to buy $GME cancels out).  Of course, DTCC knows this, but it seemed like they had RH over a barrel, and if they could depress buying to limit their own exposure, that was a fortuitous consequence.  Finally, why didn't RH then adopt this position:  You could only buy $GME with equity from selling other shares.  This would make that user's contribution to the net buy volume zero.  It would also mitigate the problem of $GME causing an increase in the net buy volume.  And, moreover, it would have drastically lessened the manipulative effect on the markets, allowing people to mostly keep buying $GME.

For all new WSBers, there‚Äôs this thing called FDs you should look into!
I know that there are a ton of new tards on this platform, and I would like to ask two questions: first, how did you get away from your tard guard, and second, who wants to go to the moon?     There‚Äôs this thing that WSB loves to discuss, called Financial Delights, or FDs. These are wonderful options that simply cannot go tits up.   The discovery of calls and puts is very exciting for new traders, but I strongly recommend you look into trading anything that is related to FDs!  Much love from a fellow retard.    this is not financial advice, I have no idea what the fuck I‚Äôm talking about because I recently escaped my tard guard as well!
CORSAIR EARNINGS PLAY, The DD you've been waiting for
Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)   Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming   Company Overview  Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.  They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.  Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $   Understanding the Business    Value Proposition    Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.    Revenue Streams    Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.  Gamer and Creator Peripherals:  which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.  Gaming Components Systems:  which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.  Acquisitions and Partnerships:  During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.  Industry    Market Size    According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest   CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.  Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.    Industry Fundamentals    Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.  Popularity of gaming is increasing:  According to Newzoo, there are an estimated   gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an   CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.  Tech-driven improvements in game quality:  Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.  Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:  Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks‚Äô State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:    On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games   More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves   Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive   Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.    The eSports and streaming flywheel    The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.  Competitive Landscape & Risks    Competition    The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair‚Äôs product offering includes:    Gaming keyboards and mice   \- Logitech and Razer    Headsets and related audio products   \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX    Streaming gear   \- Logitech and AVerMedia    Performance controllers   \- Microsoft and Logitech    PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases   \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake    High performance memory   \-  , HyperX, and Micron    Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs   \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower    Competitive Strategy    The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.    Market Share    According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.    Growth Strategy    Move into the Asia Pacific region:  The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.  Complimentary acquisitions:  Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.  New Markets:  Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.    Threat of New Entrants    Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (  use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).    Threat of Substitution    A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair‚Äôs business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.  Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user‚Äôs system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.  According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $  by 2027.  Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.    Moats    There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair‚Äôs market share across their product offering.    Other Relevant Risks    Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.  Financial Summary    Proforma Balance Sheet         Income Statement         For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:    The 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The company‚Äôs gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).    Proforma Cashflow Statement       Cash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.    Peer Comparison       Logitech International (LOGI) and Micron Technologies (MU)    Why am I posting this now?    I believe they are going to have very strong 4th quarter 2020 earning results. 2020 had record pc sales,and pc video games has reported record numbers of players. They are in my opinion the leading pc peripherals brand for gamers. Q4 Earnings Include both Black Friday and Christmas Sales    Record pc sales:     .    Google trends:         My price target for this earnings: $65      TLDR:  $CRSR will crush Q4 earnings                                      Position: 60 Contracts 40c exp 2/19   disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

SPY Puts
No numbers, no graphs‚Äì classic WSB right here. Simple enough for retardedest of retards. $GME appears to have an inverse relationship with the market itself‚Äì if $GME goes up (as I stated in a previous post) these major funds are practically required to pull money from their Large Cap stocks in order to adhere to their risk models. Also consider that as volatility goes up, the value of options contracts increase. SPY Puts are a solid strategy in this situation if you can‚Äôt buy anymore $GME positions, or are just looking for another way to capitalize.   If you‚Äôre holding $GME then    . If you can and want to buy $GME then do it, if you can‚Äôt or whatever‚Äì then SPY Puts are the way to go. I mean c‚Äômon, this is WSB when you‚Äôre left with no other options, buy options.

Link -    Looking through the Circuit breaker report it shows it triggered on Monday 2/1 Link -          Reading into Rule 201 features, it appears as if short sell restrictions have been in place since Monday??? (and will continue through Wednesday 2/3).        Can someone smarter than me post an indicator from over the last few days that shows a short ladder attack example? If not shorts and short ladder attacks driving down the price - what tanked us over the last few days? Certainly misinformation can't account for all of it can it?

$NNDM is a defense contractor (read that as safe money) that provides machines to fabricate in house secure electronic components.  ¬∞While earnings have missed for the past year, liquidity remains good at   and a cash ratio of   Cash and equivalents are around 45M. Solid numbers like this mean they could operate at a loss for a considerable amount of time.    ¬∞They have contracts with Israel (God knows they spend some money on defense), France, and a single company fixed price contract with the US Army. I am sure there are more, but this data gets a little squirrelly to find.   ¬∞They have a solid history of up and down trading with support currently sitting around 12, resistance around 16 making it a good long term or swing trade indicated by a combination of MACD and RSI.

$AMC - Why I'm holding for the long term
With AMC, it's been a battered stock for a while due to the pandemic and their debt issues - it's tough to make a buck when the government basically shuts down your business.  But... I've been looking at this stock for a while.  Then I saw Silver Lake Group LLC convert their $600 million of convertible notes into equity, so they obviously saw value in the stock at \~$13; That was enough for me to pick up about 1400 shares \~ $15 in January.  The short squeeze could have gone either way, so it was a bet I was willing to make.  Had it gone up to $100 due to a short squeeze I'd be happy - if it got crushed by the HF/Media/RH/Revolut and their manipulative fuckery (which is apparently where we're sitting now) then I'd still hold and grab some popcorn (Hopefully you all have realized that RH was never free, you were their product and we know who their masters are now).  Two years ago this was a $20 stock, and in the last 5 years it's had an ATH of $35.  Predictions are that we're going to see most of the vaccinations occur and a significant lifting of restrictions in time for Summer movie season - and the studios should have some decent blockbusters in the can where we see a big lift to movie theater attendance as us apes emerge from their caves where we have practically lived for 15 months, so assuming AMC stays out of bankruptcy (which is pretty likely at this point), even without a short squeeze this is a stock I can see popping back up to $20-$25 by Fall.  They still have their infrastructure, distribution, recliner seats, IMAX and dine-in options.  AMC is one of the top vendors for IMAX with a potential sector growth CAGR of 34% in 2021 because we're going to see increased customer spending and a demand for a high quality movie experience that Direct to Home (DTH) just can't match.  Lets face it, teenagers are still going to want to take their dates to dinner an a movie.  It's not flashy or as exciting as the GME spike, but long term it's still a good money making opportunity and holding long term or buying the dip still has the potential to see green by the end of the year.    A lot of HF still have this in their scopes and you can see their short interest is still high, but this is more than just a chance to F the HFs, this is also a good value play on a stock they've been battering.  Hold the stock, buy the dip.  It's got the fundamentals to weather this storm and emerge strong post pandemic.  And added bonus you still get to F the shorts.

$BB is a good company
Listen up retards,  I know BlAcKbErRy make phones is a solid meme, but I think it is actually a very worthwhile investment regardless of the current hype (or lack thereof) around the stock.  BlackBerry Spark was launched just earlier last year and so far is winning some decent contracts. I think it has plenty of room to grow. As governments and countries start to connect more with the internet due to covid or just technology advancing cybersecurity solutions will be more relevant. I think BB has positioned itself to be a solid choice.  The United States Airforce in September selected BlackBerry Spark ‚Äúfor their secure productivity needs.‚Äù     Samsung Knox uses BlackBerry Spark     They ‚Äúwon‚Äù the patent infringement lawsuit against Facebook, so that payout should be coming at some point. I know the stock already jumped because of the news, but still being able to uphold their patents means in the future they can sue more people for infringement and make more money.     Blackberry is out of the cell phone game which is good for them I think their software and security was really what made the phones popular to begin with so now they can focus more on that. (Also they are the largest patent holders in Canada not sure if that a really that important though)     Blackberry and Baidu have teamed up to work on autonomous cars in China     Automotive companies fuck with QNX (article is outdated) they say its in 175 million cars now     Also the deal with Amazon.     Also I think the CEO is very motivated to make it work with 5 million in shares being locked up until the stock can reach $16-20 over a 10-day trading average. Also the sweet sweet $90 mill if he can get the stock to $30 before November of 2023.     While I don‚Äôt think its going to be the rocketship I wanted it to be (I wanted it to be one so bad look at my comment history lol)  I do think it‚Äôs a sound investment and if you buy now you can earn some tidy profits. Earnings call is March 3rd so you autists can buy options for that Friday  But Im just a retarded ape so what do I know.  Not financial advice.  Edit: they have also partnered with Zoom. There is also a blackberry branded 5g phone coming out. (Blackberry isn't the company making it)  Edit2: Saw some talk about Ford ditching QNX but it looks like they will still support Sync (and Apple Car Play) in new cars so not sure how that's going to work  Last edit promise: No buying limits on $BB on any platform as far as I can tell.

WALLSTREETBETS STATE OF THE UNION
Could you imagine two weeks ago a crusade was brewing, that several million traders would soon band together to fire one, big, shot, across the bow of some the most powerful entities in the world. How could you have? And yet here we stand in the early acts of an epic, with Hollywood fighting to tell a story that has barely begun.  Community.  Wallstreetbets has not and will never be just one individual, rather a collective of ideals and goals greater than the sum of its parts. Reddit is the soapbox that allows these diverse individuals to  messages that resonate with them with their votes. That does not mean this is political -- Wallstreetbets has never and will never be political.  The financial system has always been shrouded in mystery and complexity, on purpose, to keep the golden goose beneficiaries entrenched. We‚Äôve especially seen it in action the last few weeks, where fairness and the now apparently idealistic thoughts of a level playing field have gone out the window as traders‚Äô control of their own investments was wrested from them. We see the users, we see the quality of the content, and we‚Äôre here to evangelize on your behalf. The struggle will be long and arduous. But we‚Äôre in it if you‚Äôre in it with us. Let‚Äôs get it done you amazing degenerates.  With that, a couple of our moderators have shared their personal thoughts on Wallstreetbets and the world we find ourselves in at this juncture.  _____________________________________________________________  Thoughts from /u/zjz   For a long time retail traders have been crabs in a bucket. Working alone with slow and limited data, crappy tools, bad execution, and worse advice. We used to be stuck listening almost solely to pre-approved narratives from people who already made it and wanted us to hold the bag. We used to be a bunch of duck-sized horses.  I don't think this is a continuation of OWS. This isn't  really  political. For our newfriends, WSB was never political. It isn't solely a battle between the rich and the poor, and it's not an attack on  the system . It's just the next step for retail and it's obviously scary to someone. We don't need to occupy anything, this subreddit and communities like it are soon to be the 1,000lbs gorilla in the room and we're just not quite sure how to stand yet. Retail money has always loomed large, it's just never had so much information and made most of its own decisions before. It was (mis)lead by hack analysts and at best had to huddle in index funds for safety.  When we come together on platforms like this with similar goals, similar tools, and similar data, we become a force that can, even without any centralization, coordination, or deep pockets, easily destroy well-funded opponents and cause them to have to break the rules just to stay alive. Random people that have never spoken before buying GME for reasons ranging from "haha brrr" to 30 page writeups can cause spikes that can nearly bankrupt the kind of people that aren't used to being the ones on the losing end. They're used to being the only ones with a big stick.  This is only going to accelerate unless the other actors in this space rig the game in their favor even further   or trick us into destroying the means by which we can sit at the table  . You notice how many circuit breakers there were on the way up vs the way down? Don't accept anything that limits our access to equities, options, futures, etc. Raise hell if they try.  In order to function we need to figure out how to cram as many monkeys on as many typewriters as possible. We need to figure out how to make sure the whole sub sees what those monkeys write, we need to filter noise from signal via millions of self-interested actors. We need to figure out how we can avoid being outmaneuvered by people who will not play fair. We've got problems to solve and there will be growing pains, but we've all got a chance to be part of something that hasn't existed before. Something between a fund, a social network, a union, and an API. Work with us on improving this place and getting settled into this mode of operation instead of breaking into pieces. They'd love that. Apes apart weak.  Nobody should blame you if you love the stock or sold the stock. You should be here to make money. There will be a next time and a time after that. They can only cheat so many times before it catches up with them, they only have so many brains on the task, and we're only getting bigger.  ___________  Thoughts from /u/wallstreetboyfriend  If you‚Äôre still reading, thank you. I‚Äôm last because I‚Äôm least important. If you only skimmed the above content, fuck you. Go back and read it.  Please give all of our mods a shout out and remember to do your part by following our subreddit rules.  As a reminder: We‚Äôre all volunteers, and we do NOT accept donations. We appreciate the sentiment in wanting to donate to us, but it would be great if you donated to a charity in our name instead.  (Check out   if you want suggestions)    I‚Äôve been here since the sub was <2000 members.   It really didn‚Äôt hit me on how crazy everything was getting until I checked Twitter last week.  Regardless of our personal political views, let‚Äôs marvel at the fact that Ted Cruz, AOC, Trump Jr, Chamath, Musk, Cuban, and countless others from various backgrounds and viewpoints agree so strongly on a single topic. We‚Äôve had everything from fractional share owners to multi-millionaires band together because they like a stock. We‚Äôve been in the news cycles nonstop, and there‚Äôs even tendies commercials.  Memes aside, things have been shitty for individual traders. Recent events have highlighted how skewed the game has been towards institutional traders. Whether or not there was any intentional wrongdoing, the inherent biases for a hedge fund being bailed out by another hedge fund and ALSO being a major contributor to a large portion of a brokerage‚Äôs earnings is kinda fucked up. While I‚Äôm not smart enough to say whether the game is 100% rigged, it certainly doesn‚Äôt look good. The US government breaks up monopolies for this very reason, don‚Äôt they?  The institutional investors claim we don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing.  I‚Äôm just an artist myself, but there are a ton of you here, old and new, who are well-educated and actually do proper DD.  Despite that, hedge funds continued to freely trade while retail traders were locked out. We‚Äôre showing them we can make decisions with our own finances, but institutions don‚Äôt like that. They enact laws and force emergency actions to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù us when the reality is that it limits our ability to compete   fairly  . Can someone explain to me how Pattern Day Trading protects the retail investor? Can someone explain to me why an individual must have > $1m in assets to be an accredited investor?   There‚Äôs an opportunity in front of us -- We have a chance to make a difference and maybe level the playing field. There are government hearings on Feb 18th, and we have politicians from ALL sides offering to look into what happened.   We even have billionaires like Mark Cuban and the Winklevoss Twins speaking out against this unfairness.   Regardless of what happens, I‚Äôm just thankful that I got to be here from the start. Our jungle may be bigger, but it‚Äôs been the same bananas the whole time.  So what now? We have an opportunity to change the game. We need to move away from a system with power in the hands of the few to one where power is in the hands of the many. The alternative is that we stay where we are now, where the fate of retail traders is at the whim of archaic institutions. Where they can arbitrarily halt stocks and shackle the free market.  Why can I Cashapp someone for feet pics in  seconds , but it takes TWO WHOLE DAYS for shares to be delivered from the DTCC?  Why do they also get to choose what the deposit requirements are? Something needs to change, and I‚Äôm certain we‚Äôre not limited by the technology. We‚Äôre limited by the people.
33% of the 30 minute price markers on GME since Thursday have ended on exact or near exact whole number prices (Ending in .00).. This is almost statistically impossible.
VW 2008, GME and you Autists
Alright you Apes listen. Gotta combat some of this shit.  I keep seeing so many posts around here about this squeeze and that the 2008 VW squeeze are totally the same. Or that in 2008 the VW squeeze happened with a much smaller short position.   They are not the same full stop and the VW squeeze didn't have a smaller short position.  First and foremost I'm holding 9 shares at an avg cost of $  I'm still in it but all the shit DD needs to stop.   Sorry if this hurts your feelings.  So first and foremost just because they are both short squeezes does not mean they are going to behave the same. Part of the reason for this is the suprise and speed at which the VW squeeze happened to funds.  Second and the main part of this post. The short position was not actually smaller in VW. I'll explain.   In 2008 the VW short squeeze happened causing VW to become the most valued company on the entire NYSE. The reason for this situation is similar to the current situation there were more shorts out than shares to cover.   Now I already hear your stupid screeching "BUT IS WAS ONLY 12 PERCENT SHORT!!!"  Now I'm sure you had to kick off your shoes and socks to count that high and really I'm proud but here is the whole story.  Porsche had quietly bought nearly 75% of the company. This was done in a few sneaky ways but ultimately that's what happened.  Now before this there were only 45% of the shares available anyways due to Porsche having an existing 30% stake various index funds 5% and finally 20% covered by the german government.  To break it down 30+20+5 = 55% already owned. and 13 percent or so short.  Now let's add in Porsche's new stake 75+20+5=95%  And since these shares are now bought by people who have no interest or in some cases no ability to sell we there is a 13% short position on only about 5% of trading shares.  The final catalist was VW issuing a statement to the shorts letting them know they were super duper fucked. Like you forgot to pick up your wife's birth control and now your rasing her boyfriends son levels of fucked.  This caused the short squeeze from hell.  Now as to our current dilemma. Nothing is guaranteed to behave the same however if the shorts have not closed their positions sufficiently this might happen again. So good news for we big dick diamond hand fuckers if that is the case. But anyone who this is your first time at this shit know that you might be about to learn a painful fucking lesson that just because 2 similar things happen it doesn't mean shit.  That being said HOLD THE FUCKING LINE AND BUY THE DIPS

We will buy so much fucking AMC that the next time they try to short ladder us, they‚Äôll just GUH their way into failure. I commend them for weeding out our weak, however, their game is going to be much harder to keep up from here on out...  If you‚Äôre still here, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre a true retard. It‚Äôs a good thing that that‚Äôs exactly what we need. A group of stubborn, persistent retards.   (Disclaimer: not a financial advisor just another monkey)
Plans from here on, we have many options.
Fellow Degenerates, happy day to you all, or not considering we got ripped 2 new assholes today.   Anyway, besides that fact I want to get some insight on what your plans for the next few days are?   First let me start off by saying that I have not sold a single share of GME OR AMC. I am holding both. But I did have 55x $5 calls for AMC that I sold on expiration day (Jan 29th) which netted me a very healthy profit.   I feel as if the true squeeze has not yet even begun. In the back of my mind I have this crazy theory that the market makers and hedge funds deliberately and illegally drove the price down for one main reason. They now want to be apart of the squeeze as well.   I mean from a financial standpoint why would they not want to make thousands of % of gains? When instead they can only make 100% when they short.   They are starting to realize the true power behind this movement, they know that it is not going to be easily stopped and the main squeeze is inevitable.  Now what do bagholders do? Well frankly you have 2 options here. Option #1 is, continue to hold your bags patiently and wait until the moon. Option #2 continue to hold your bags and wait until we land on fucking Pluto   Now there is also a option #3 and that option is to close your position and take whatever money you have left and run. This option sucks donkey ducks. And in turn will probably cause you life long depression when and if we squeeze to astronomical heights.   Now, I say this with a heavy heart, but if you sold.... Your a bitch. If you feel stupid for buying in, then you probably are. We all know what the risks are. Who buys a stock that goes from $2 to $500 in a matter of days and then wonders why it dropped? You, you bitch. Do not be clueless, do not let this demotivate you. You don‚Äôt lose until you sell. You still have your shares. Doesn‚Äôt matter what you paid for them at this point because if you bought at $500 you 10000% were not planning on selling at $525 or even $575. So nothing here has changed. Wait until the real squeeze.   And if all else fails, well you can look back and say you were apart of history. Not that anyone is gonna give a fuck. Anyways fuck you all. Thank you. And so long! Much love!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Sooo you're telling me there's a chance.. üòÉ
$GME, what comes next?
Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.  The shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME >100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.  That's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.  Now, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?  When the share price drops, 3 things happen:  1. paper handers sell 2. diamond handers buy 3. short sellers must cover  As prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.  This is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.     Alternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up. For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen. ‚ù§Ô∏è     Positions: 1000 GME shares,    üçÜ
A theory on hedges and a possible squeeze.
One theory I have been batting around my head.   Due to the massive losses to the hedges. Why wouldn‚Äôt a couple of hedges. Once they have covered. Start massively going long in order to start a massive squeeze to get rid of all the other hedges that are still short. (Still a large short interest) It would only take a small push I think from some big hedges to kickstart the perpetual upward rise.  Retail would join in. The whales are already in.  They would then bail when the squeeze is sqoze and their competition is gone.   Why would they do this.  1. It gets rid of the competition  2. It minimises their losses from the previous shorts. If done right it could actually make them profit.   Why wouldn‚Äôt they do this 1. It would make retail think they won and were right.  Cant have the little guy declaring victory. Is pride more important than money to these despicable miscreants.   If this is correct then those holding could be rewarded by the hedges.  It would also explain why there was $25m in $800 3/19 calls.   $GME to the moon.    üé≤ ü§ù ü§ù ü§ùüé≤üìàüìàüìà    ü™êü™êü™êü™ê   this should not be taken as financial advice.

AMC and GME not in short sale circuit breaker list, yet dropped 50%+ in a single day? What is going on?!
How is AMC and GME not on this list?   "¬†The short sale circuit breaker rule normally refers to the SEC's recent adoption of a new version of the¬†uptick rule. The new uptick rule triggers a ban on short selling when the stock drops a certain amount. The SEC defines the¬†process¬†like this:  The "circuit breaker" is triggered for a security any day the price declines by 10% or more from the prior day's closing price  The alternative uptick rule, which permits short selling only "if the price of the security is above the current¬†national best bid."   The rule applies "to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day as well as the following day."
TAKE A BREAK
We went overboard. Im not asking you to hold nor to sell. Im asking you apes to take a break. Every trade is gonna have a winner and loser. There are retards that made a ton of money. There are retards that lost a lot of money. Take the night off, or the morning or the whole day. We saw something together. We saw that in the moment, when it really counted, when the HF were on the ropes, we were cut off. The HF were not. IT wasn't a technical problem, it wasn't a volume issue that overloaded the system. It was people like you and me that were pushed off the field when we were playing our best. We learned that every single time you have ever entered a trade, they were waiting, watching to see if they could push us off the field should the situation call for it. It's a dirty game. We played it as well as it could be played. Now, please, take a break.

You guys are paper handing $GME because you haven't seen the squoze yet and are worried the company is worth nothing
Most of you retards in GME got in when the stock already jumped several times from where it was 8 weeks ago. You're all shouting Wall St is preventing the MOASS through manipulative actions (they definitely are). However you're all losing sight of why the short squeeze was even possible in the first place and pissing your pants wetting your paper hands in the process.    We didn't invest in GME because the shorts were over 140% of the float and wanted to punish Wall St    If any of you autists actually did some DD or even watched some of DFV's videos, you'll realize that GME was a value play,  the short squeeze was just the cherry on top . I have seen over the past two weeks, a huge gaslighting effort from billionaires on TV (and unintentionally reddit users pushing only the MOASS), getting you to believe that Gamestop's value is from the short squeeze. What everyone forgot is how valuable of a company Gamestop is now.    So what changed about Gamestop?    In Nov 2020 Ryan fking Cohen joined Gamestop's Board. Who is Ryan Cohen? This is the guy who built Chewy from the ground up, he was in all respects, able to build a Pet e-commerce empire and directly compete with   Amazon  . Not only did Ryan join the board, but he was able to bring along with him Chewy's COO/CMO and CFO. You know who else is on the board? Reggie Fils-Aim√©, the previous President of Nintendo Americas. If you don't know Reggie, you definitely know his face. So now you know Gamestop is poised for a shakeup, Ryan didn't join the Board and bring with him two other people because he thought Gamestop was going to get squozed, he did it because he understands there is a lot of money to be made here.    Valuation    I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert in valuing companies. Properly evaluating a company purely based on financials does not work in today's market anymore, but to appease the F people.  Here are some facts:  Critics argue brick and mortar retail, and as a result Gamestop, is dying. While they aren't wrong, they fail to also address that Gamestop had   300% YoY growth in e-commerce sales  . Gamestop is also actively shutting down stores and rebranding existing ones as experience centers. Physical Gamestop stores are going to be where all you autists hang out when you're outside of your rooms.  Gaming is huge, anyone who argues otherwise is living under a rock. As cringe as it was, Ninja hosting the NYC ball drop is testament to this. Singular game titles like Fortnite and Minecraft are worth billions alone. The gaming industry itself is worth nearly   $200 Billion   and slated to grow double digits YoY.     >This market cap (matching industry standards) should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $  is why the short squeeze is distracting many. In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.  To repeat that, based on fundamentals alone (nothing to do with a short squeeze), GME per share could be worth $800 conservatively, or $50 Billion. Chewy at this time is worth roughly $40 Billion in a smaller market, Pet products vs Gaming.  So polish your paper hands and turn them into fking diamonds. There is nothing Wall St can do can make you sell. And when this company starts turning itself around, you'll have been at the ground floor.     TL:DR Gamestop not worth nothing if shorts not squoze. Everyone wants you to believe it so you can sell now. Gaming is huge, Gamestop is positioning itself to be big.       For all you retards, everyday you hold your shares is another day Melvin and co need to pay interest. Hold your stocks for at least a year, and you even get to pay long term capital gains tax as opposed to short term counts as ordinary income. (Read hold onto your shares for longer, less booboo from govt). Also this is why you don't fking buy on margin or play with options.
HOLD BOYS!

The GME Short Squeeze & PLTR Black Friday (for new apes only)
Gather round retards and let me tell you the story of Palantir Black Friday and how sentiments then mirror sentiments now with the massive GME dip.  In the days leading up to Black Friday, PLTR was ripping, easily projecting to break the $40s. But what happened you say? Yes, Thanksgiving happened and although momentum did not actually slow down, sentiments did. People realized how much tendies they were getting and decided to take profit. Yes we all know that shitron and the subsequent downgrades were the primary catalysts for PLTR‚Äôs dip and its month long sideways trade. But the profit taking due to a day of market closure realized while eating turkey with family was a secondary reason.  Everyone believed that the weekend after Black Friday would cool negative sentiment and it was just a minor dip but boy were we wrong. That baby dropped to $22.  After that, PLTR traded sideways for all of December, setting itself up for nice wedges but never happened. Thousands of accounts were wiped.  How does this relate to you and the GME squeeze?  The weekend happened. Everyone thought this was the week of reckoning, but it wasn‚Äô  far. Just because the hive mind here thinks something will happen and even if all the TA points to a breakout, that doesn‚Äôt mean it will and in fact, the opposite can happen. Like the other posts have said, the market does not care if all of your stars aligned and certainly will not move to confirm your biases. There is no defined time limit for how long the hedges can last and they can most likely outlast you unless you play your cards correctly.  With that being said, I DO believe the squeeze is yet to come with the stipulation that we collectively hold.  TLDR: Know your risk tolerance, listen to the apes   you dare. Hold GME till we bankrupt the hedges.
Cohen still has the opportunity to buy another 7%. Seems like a great price to do so.
A while back I read a   by u/FatAspirations talking about how big of a player Cohen truly is in all of this. Given the massive red days we've seen twice this week I'd really recommend giving it a read. But the one point that's important, and point of this post is:    Cohen still has a contract to buy another 7% of GME Shares  He currently owns around 13%, and is restricted to owning no more than 20% as part of an agreement. Obviously he wouldn't want to exercise that right when the price is $350, and he has until the end of 2022 to do it, but if he thinks $100 is the new Floor, or around there, wouldn't this be the best time for him to do so?  Every single one of his share purchases in the past have been about sending a message. Why not this one too?  Edit: 7% would equate to about 5M shares of a 70M Float, if my maffs right. But am retard.       (160 @ $49)
I love this community and I will     to zero with you in GME if necessary. Added more tickets to Valhalla today.
NYT thinks dabbing is still a thing
GME's Data irregularities
Today, I found another irregularity in GME's data. When I looked at the position-cost distribution chart for GME after today's close, I was expecting it to be very different compared to yesterday's chart, since assuming paper hands have sold, they would change this distribution significantly (and today's volume SEEMED to be high). However, I found something fascinating: today's chart was a super-set of yesterday's chart! In other words, it looks like some shares were added to the float and it looks like almost none of the previous shares has moved (diamond hands goes here)!  Take a look:     Webull's description of what this chart represents is the following:     If I'm reading this correctly, this means two things:  1. It looks like all the shares that were traded today were new and added to the float! 2. People actually seem to be diamond handing!  I can see four possible explanations for the new shares (add a comment if you see other possibilities):  1. GameStop offered shares: this didn't happen as far as I know! 2. An institution that had shares that weren't in the float sold his shares: I can't find any filings, especially with this many shares, but there could be a delay 3. Short sellers borrowed shares that were not in the float (which probably were covered and returned before) and shorted them again. 4. Naked shorting!  The reason why I think 1 and 2 are unlikely is that almost all of the sell orders I saw today were trying to bring the price down, so an insider or an institution that is not short probably wasn't the one selling (they are also probably in a blackout period, but I'm not sure)!  I think 3 is more likely than 4, so I think someone was shorting the shit out of GME today, increasing the short interest considerably.  But here's the thing: at the end of the day, these new shares seem to be not that many, and the same chart seem to be showing that all of the previous shares are already locked, I think these shares will be locked in a few days/hours as well (if they haven't been locked already). So this somewhat guarantees a close to infinity short interest. Furthermore, given that all of these shares were shorted at a relatively low price, so I believe that whoever did (is doing) this, is just digging his own grave! I'm not sure if this continues or not (depends on how many shares they can borrow from institutions), but it made me feel better to see people don't seem to be paper handing that much!  PS. I wish Webull would put a proper X-axis on this chart, that would be very useful!  PS2. To SEC/Government agencies: It seems like you don't care about the retail investors, but let me give you another incentive: if you don't stop these short-selling morons from blowing themselves up over and over again, I think you might end up having a legitimate market crash/financial crisis on your hands! It doesn't matter how much money these folks have, since these guys are at mercy of the shareholders: the supply of shares is EXTREMELY low and the demand is EXTREMELY high (even though the brokerages have artificially reduced the demand for now). From what I'm seeing on this sub (and from the data), people don't seem to have plans to sell below $1k-$10k per share (I wouldn't be surprised if that moves up to $50k-$100k per share if GME SP reaches $1k-$10k), do the math yourselves!     Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares. I also added a few weekly calls today!    EDIT: tldr; It seems like today:  ü¶ß did         attacked  EDIT2: Someone said there is another possible explanation: call writers might have dumped their shares if last week‚Äôs expired calls were canceled (if they hedged them earlier). This can also explain the added shares and the dump, since market makers might have an incentive to kill next week‚Äôs call options!
OKAY PaperHand POS listen up we gotta think long term.. earnings is coming up & we all need to purchase some physical game copies
I don‚Äôt even need to mention earnings on 3/25 for said company this is when my HERO DFV made his initial decision last year to yolo $50k   NOW   We need to blast those numbers & buy all future purchase from our favorite game selling store... you need a snack? GO TO GAME STOP  YOU NEED GAMES ??? GO get physical copies.  You need cheesy gifts...? Go to my lord & savors favorite store GME  Earnings will be a blow out.. I‚Äôm gonna go buy my girlfriends boyfriend a ‚ÄúSnickers‚Äù & a pack of ‚ÄúM&Ms‚Äù he gets grumpy when hangry..  Edit: For people who think this is real DD ü§° ü§° admittedly I should have flared it satire üëçüèº
Guys, I promised my wife I‚Äôd get our backyard done before her boyfriend does. But I‚Äôm    till we get a palace built instead! Keep holding fellow  ‚Äôs. #TogetherWeAreStrong!
$GME üìÑ+   = ü§ë (still holding 1 share don‚Äôt worry)
Just a friendly 15 month reminder, yohb?
Guess you don‚Äôt really loose till you sell. Holding for the long run.
Down 28k, was up 60k last Thursday morning. 0 or  . Bought another 900 at $88 in new account.     üèª üèª üèª not for sale!! I ain‚Äôt have any brain so media, analysts or bots brainwash. Wait what? Only wash I know is found on moon.
Sure is a red one today, huh?
"I" need to disassociate DFV with this influx of Retail Investors and GME as a whole. And WSB needs to stop acting like the   mob mentality didn't get "me" here.
First off Positions: 115 @ $85 20@$300 avg I have less in this than a lot of people here. And I'm still holding, haven't dropped a single share. I'm not trying marginalize or kill morale but something needs to change.     That's fucking AWESOME that DFV is still in and is holding with his diamond dong, but first things first, he cashed out $13M along the way and has been very transparent on this. What's losing $20M if you're up $40M?      DFV is why a lot of retail investors entered the market. DFV never intended for this to hit as high as it did and that's apparent in his positions, he thought GME was heavily shorted and had a lot of potential, but there's no way he thought it would lead to short squeeze 1k+ territory.   HE IS NOT THE NUMBERS BEHIND THIS AND "I" NEED TO THINK FOR MYSELF  "I" need to stop making him a martyr for this sub for the day he eventually sells. The SEC is probably watching him like a hawk and I'm assuming that's a big reason that he's still in even though it's in his long play.      Also the SWEEPING DOGSHIT MORALE needs to stop. This sub went from      " BUY BUY BUY BUY EVERYONE BUY"   to:      "Wow everyone here has such high expectations you shouldn't be taking this unsatirically and you should only afford to play with what you lose." "Here's a gambling hotline" "Wow what a dumb play"     If that's not bots; that's the sub taking a shitty 180 at the first sign of real defeat and if "I" have any chance of seeing this through, "I" need to stay motivated, turn off the ticker, and check in at major mile markers to see where this is at.     "My" chance at a squeeze was last week but the weak ass SEC chose to turn a blind eye to it and everyone should be VERY CAUTIOUS OF ROBINHOOD/IB+ ANY OTHER BROKERS SITTING ON LESS THANT 1T RESERVES.     In fact? "I" NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOW A FEW WEEK PLAY MINIMUM AS LAST WEEK WAS PULLED FROM "ME" SO GET OUT OF SMALLER BROKERS NOW.     SO STAY STRONG RETARDS AND SEE YOU IN THE HAMPTONS.
Thanks for Keeping Me Safe Robinhood! I didn‚Äôt need that! Look at the Time
First 2 days of trading has been rough. Not sellin tho!
Lessons Learned
Lessons learned:  WSB made me more money in the last 4 months than I ever could have made without them.  Thank you.  DTC is the real enemy.  Synthetic longs (counterfeit shares) are the tool of the trade.  Hedge funds are the destroyers of companies, not the builders.  Long live the incubators and encouragers. Thank you Cathy Wood and Ark investments.  The SEC doesn't give a fuck.  They are completely owned by DTC  The financial media are owned by Wall Street.  They also don't give a fuck.  Until block       chain technology is applied to stock ownership the market is completely and irretrievably corrupt.  edit: DTC = Depository Trust Company
Will watch it go to zero before I sell them! In fact I bought more today!  ü§≤
Red has a range of symbolic meanings, including life, health, vigor, war, courage, anger, love and religious fervor. The common thread is that all these require passion, and the "life force" that drives passion blood is red. GME / AMC / BB / BBBY loss. I need a nap.
Please be honest with yourself
It's been touted many times already, and it has fallen on more deaf ears than it should have, but please stop YOLO-ing more money into these reddit stocks than you should be. Be more direct and focused with how you are spending your remaining resources in what is likely the final chapters of this story (cue the downvote).      Your account value is a direct reflection of your choices, so  don't throw away your ability to continue making those choices.    Just think about what you're actually doing and who you're actually hurting for a second.  As someone who's followed this sub for many years, I can guarantee you that EVERYONE who bought into this <$20 did so on a fundamental understanding of what this equity actually is.  For those of you buying in >$90, I would bet that you do not. You are going into this with only a "screw the hedgies" or "buy the dip" mentality which will only get you so far. And every true WSBer here can attest that that mentality WILL NOT get you far. Once you hit the end of your road (margin call, options expire worthless, needing cash, SO about to murder you), you are done here. And you may be done with "investing" for a loooonnnggg time.     Stop targeting your last dollars into these stocks thinking it's actually sending a message. IT'S NOT.       This brings me to my second point of using your resources. Take the military for example, do you fire your weapon nonstop hoping you hit your target? Don't think so. Does the fact that you have a few million bros with you change that fact? It shouldn't. You have to be decisive and calculated with your ammo, and you definitely do not waste it unless you are absolutely sure it will help your cause.     No one here, on twitter, Wall St, or even Mark Cuban really cares how many shares you have.  Seriously, when the dust settles, no one cares. Imagine the wealth of knowledge and information you can obtain with 5k. The courses, tools, and trading platform upgrades you can get with 10k. There is so much you can ACTUALLY do with your money to help you understand this system and help you appreciate it what it can do for you long term.   I promise you the HFs have invested millions into research, education and data analysis before they YOLO into anything. Why won't you do the same for yourself?      So please, don't keep tossing your money into a depreciating proposition backed by principles just so you can blame someone who has no fiduciary duty to care about you.   It will only cripple you and your mentality. A million jokers running into a casino with millions of dollars is not going to beat the house. They will only feed it.  A few well-trained card counters with a thousand bucks, who fully understand the system, just might.  So be honest with yourself.
I AIN'T FUCKING LEAVING!
Should I buy more.... I think so
IM HOLDING BECAUSE ITS GONNA GO UP
Will probably get deleted, but I‚Äôm with you   brothers
anyone else peanut butter & jelly experiencing what is going on?
Jelly to see how retail-based brokers blatantly manipulated the markets by selling off data/throttled trades for market makers.  # At this point, they are doing it right out into the open using fancy words to try to hide their bullshit.       "Oh, the market mechanism allows in this circumstance for shorts to be above 100%" no it fuckin doesn't. YOU are over-leveraging bullshit (naked short, illegal) to artificially deflate the value of a company. ILLEGAL. In what world can you borrow something you don't own, and let someone else borrow the right to you not owning it?   Heavy volume manipulation after hours, wtf   During the time we can potentially buy...Limiting the masses from literally buying the stock.   Colluding with other market makers, banks, brokers, out in the open too. Fuck they even paid boomer media to try and change the opinion of the masses (beyond illegal)       We need class-actions going against all the brokers, funds involved, the SEC as well for letting it happen.  I want my cock sucked by every perpetrator personally as remediation.
The past few days are reminiscent to when you would pack up your game console, games, accessories thinking you'd get some money from GameStop.. to only get.. $1. STILL      THO.
Diamond Hands Listen Up! GME is on sale right now and will be going to the moon THIS week. The hedges played us so hard that they have played themselves.
\ \ TDLR at the bottom\ \   First off, to all of you diamond handing this stock, god damn I love you apes.  Now listen up and listen closely. GME is still on a moon mission and its launch is imminent. I've seen some fantastic DD here that is far beyond my analytical skills and I thank you all for that because god knows I can't read so the charts help.  This break down is going to be consist of something we tend to lack here, and that my friends, is logic.  So lets get into it.   This past week has seen GME hit an ATH followed by a steep decline due to market manipulation tactics and the media turning against us at presumably the hand of the hedge funds we stand to hurt the most. We have seen hit pieces on GME, misdirection, and blatant lies regarding the analytics and reporting of statistics on GME. Countless media outlets have claimed that GME has squeezed already and its over! Its done! Move on and move back in with your wife's boyfriend!  But they are wrong.  Think of this from a surface level and look at the big picture. This entire week was a setup for shorts to mitigate their losses which they knew they would incur regardless. First, we saw a price spike that opened up options far, far OTM.  Out to 800 fucking dollar calls. Then, we saw a steep decline in price along with a fundraiser for shorts in the form of SLV being pushed by shills. Following this we saw massive purchases of these OTM 800c yesterday once premiums and IV were reduced. So what does this mean? Hedges set themselves up to mitigate how much they'll lose in hopes of just avoiding bankruptcy while giving their associates a chance to profit even greater on the impending squeeze.   Now why would it come this week if a lot of the calls are dated out to March you ask? Apparently, and I don't know this for fact, but Fintel will update GME's short interest officially as of next Tuesday, February 9th. If this is true, and short interest is still over 100%, this will confirm that media outlets were bought and paid for by hedges along with their misdirection, thus causing even further public outrage, and another mass buying of GME to get in on the squeeze that is still coming.   However, if hedges knock the price down as far as possible and trigger the squeeze this week, they will have effectively hedged their bets with calls, shaken out as many paper hands as possible, and stopped delaying the inevitable, all while leaving the media outlets they paid off, now holding the metaphorical bag of lost public trust, all while mitigating their losses to the fullest extent.   Essentially, if the short interest is still outstanding and above 100%, shorts would fuck themselves even further by allowing an official report of this to come out and they know it.   We go the moon soon my fellow apes. Good luck and God speed. See you at 10,000.  This is NOT financial advice and I AM and APE.     TLDR: Hedges have mitigated their losses and have screwed buyers and the media outlets they've bought. When official short interest reports come out, they'll be outed as liars and the retail retaliation will send us even further to the moon than if they just let it happen prior to these reports.

Where are my fellow diamond hands? Down over 2 mil from GME's peak last week. Still holding and adding to my position.
Lost a Total of 14 but DIAMOND HANDS
I think the HF's are leaving the writers of the 800c 2/5 options as the bag holders.
Imagine you are an HF that shorted this stock to oblivion, and a bunch of retards come into a long position raising the price by 1000%. The interest rate on your shorts goes through the roof and you are about to go bankrupt. What do you do? First you up your fire power by bringing in funds. Then you vilify your enemies, telling the world that they are the problem, not you. Then you stop the squeeze by putting a throttle on demand side. Then you divert the money to side show securities that will actually raise your bottom line.     What next? You still have to pay back the shares. You are not going to get it cheap. How do we limit it? I could buy cheap way OTM call options knowing that when we start to cover, the price is going to explode because the diamond handed apes won't be selling for cheap. How do you maximize this?   1) you need a cheap OTM call. Since 2 weeks ago, the highest call was 160, and last week was 320, they weren't far enough out of the money to be cheap.   2) to make it cheaper, you need it to look like the squeeze has squoze, and gain as many shares from paper hands on the way down. Lowering the price per share on the call options.   3) purchase enough OTM calls to cover your short position after it explodes. Locking in your price to cover at 800 per share max.      Proof:        Here we can see that there is a volume of 28,493 call options purchased. Holy shit...  That is   million shares.   Billion dollars worth at that strike price.   With the volume of trades as it rises to that point, plus the volume of those calls, they could bring their short positions low enough to complete the squeeze.     Who is left holding the bag? HF will mostly hold the bag. Seeing as they will be paying   Billion dollars at least. Then the real bag holders will be the writers of the call options. They will have to purchase the shares raising the price above 800 due to a gamma squeeze.   TL;DR: I believe hedge funds have gotten rid of their risk of having to pay the 10k per share we think is reasonable to a max of 800 by purchasing way out of the money calls, and writers of call options will be the biggest bag holders in history.      Guys I'm just a retard that has never professionally traded, I don't know shit about shit. I'm holding on to my stocks, and they will have to pry them out of my cold dead diamond hands. Don't listen to this. It's not financial advice.      Please poke holes in  'm getting way too excited.
To all my fellow retards/autists, be positive
Tldr: GME on sale bitches             It is late in the morning, I just woke up a little after 9. I get up, turn on my computer, and open Etrade. Notice that Spy,QQQ, and Dia are up and think this must be a good day. Account details finally show up, and I see that my account kamikaze to the floor. Click the search bar, type GME, and see that it is at $85. Heart   Then open WSB, see retards crying, complaining, and saying this is end of the squeeze.   No. No it is not. GME just went on sale, steam spring sale, buy one get one free, store wide discount, whatever the heck you want, they knew that some of us didn't have the money to pay +$200 for 1 stock, so they came down to refuel and pick up others so they don't have to be lonely. Once everyone is on board, to the moon we go to repopulate with the wives/gf/daughters of paperhands. Reaching prices above $500 and then to infinity and beyond.   In other words, don't be a   , buy the dip, and we'll be amongst the tendies in no time.
$GME Ride - Down Another $110k Today - Tomorrow‚Äôs Game Plan

[DD] heavy put option buying made GME go down today
As the title suggests,  just glancing at the option chain today you will see lots of put options being bought today. Feb 5 100p had the highest volume today at 22k with 7k OI, call volumes don't even compare. Like it or not in general people are bearish on the stock and the fact that 100P is now pretty deep ITM doesn't bode well for the stock. What we are experiencing is pretty much a gamma squeeze but downwards.   That halt today was pretty bullshit because we were on the way up above 100  and an IV crush on OTM $100 puts would've given us some momentum upward. But no it just had to happen on the way up.   Anyways this week looks pretty bearish and it is possible we could dump some more if we don't take back 100. I've been wrong before and I hope I'm wrong again. Keep diamond handing though, MM has been fucking with us by jacking up the price of options to make it harder for us to buy and profit from this. They can't do this forever and in fact, I've been profiting by selling OTM puts at great prices while holding onto my shares, I know theta gang isn't welcome here but what could be better than getting paid to hold gme at discount prices? or selling puts to expire worthless to GME bears?    Anyways as soon as IV dies down, which could take a while, it's time to start buying YOLO  FD call options again.   GME to   is my price target
Can we say today was a forced $GME call squeeze?
I am noob to this, but hear me out, the folks who bought $GME calls on margin are being squeeze out, since the price dropped, I heard reports that some people where unable to fund their accounts (Robinhood/webull slowing bank deposits) and they were forced to liquidate.  Since the buy side was limited and options calls were liquidate, the price had to down.  I believe the shorts are still exposed. They won this battle, the war is not over yet!    Diamond hands!    Not financial advice and I don't have skin in game(I am broke), I just want WSB to win and expose the counterfeiting stock scam!
As soon as webull clears my deposit I‚Äôm doing the only DD I know... doubling down.
Finally got word from Ja. Panicked and bought more $GME They‚Äôll have to pry this stock out of my cold   üèΩ
Starting 2021 off right!! GME till $10,000 or $0 no in-between!
DD on Delta Airlines, Calls for Jan 2022
Listen up retards,  Many of you are probably looking for a new direction from which tendies may fly. Well do I have a solution for you. It‚Äôs a big reverse course from the boomer dinner this sub ate over the past few weeks.  Yes my friends, I propose aggressive call options/long positions on the Airline industry, specifically Delta. Here‚Äôs why:  Past:  \- Going back to a report by Forbes,   in terms of cleanliness during COVID, meaning prevailing sentiment among travelers is high right now.  Present:  \- Delta is the  , thereby spacing passengers out.   \- This is good because, again it improves customer safety/feeling of safety during flights  \- This also means that they have been seating fewer passengers throughout the pandemic, while total profits have remained largely equal with their major competitors  \- Tighter self-imposed restrictions may mean fewer international restrictions, but this is more speculative than anything  Future:  \- Expects to hit profitability by July  \- Pandemic expense cuts to older aircraft should present a $400m decrease to annual costs, even when considering a   up in overhead as traffic increases  \- Delta expects at least 70% of their large corporate clients to return by the end of the year  Those final 2 points are from their last earning call, which means‚Ä¶ well of course theyd be bullish on themselves, but if its to be believed, then Delta is ready to come out of the pandemic strong. With a mix of leisure travel skyrocketing, business travel returning to some extent, and the holidays leading to a traffic spike right in time for Jan 2022 calls, I‚Äôm thinking of going hog deep in 65c at $  a piece.  My main price suppressing factor is that   until late 2021. If children can‚Äôt get the vaccine then families cannot travel. I'm banking a lot here on the vast majority of Americans getting the vaccine in time for Christmas. As a result my theory leads me to the Jan 2022 options, rather than the Sep ones, as the holiday rush will play out before they expire.  TLDR:  Plane no fly good now, but stock not so bad. When plane fly more, stock more better.
Still holding. I did my own research üôèü§û      short squeeze is real and it still can happen!
HOW TO TAKE THEM DOWN ONCE AND FOR ALL IN ONE DAY!
Retards listen up. Send instructions to your wall street blood subrokerage firm to mail your Gme certificates to your shitty homes. If they do not comply within 3 days, ask to speak to their compliance department  and they will do it. Next order a game from your local game stop store. When you get the certificates guard them with your life because they will be worth allot.    Here are the steps for u idiots:  1. Send instructions to your brokerage firm to mail out GME certificates to your home   2. Sell covered calls slightly higher than the market price for your AMC, BB or any other stonk you own   3. Use the income from the covered calls to buy more GME stock, if you like the stock and have those sent home.   4. Order a game from game stop before the end of the day, because they sell great games. Get someone to help you with the math if you can't figure out what happens next. Real diamond hands sleep with their certificates under their pillow.   This would crush the brokerage firm and the hedge funds. IN ONE DAY!!  EDIT: they borrowed your stock to short. They have to buy if hold your certificates. Idiots.
I unironically believe that you only lose money when you sell
Market manipulation and the blame goes to...
To us. Canadian authorities gonna investigate in the case of GME because of market manipulation as the stocks felt below 100$.  They accusing ‚Äûforums‚Äú where people manipulate to protect investors ü§°  May be just maybe let the basic system of a free market work and let supply and demand find a price without restricting the one or the other. You don‚Äôt need a degree in Economics to tell that the price go down if you cripple the whole bid-side.  Or May be don‚Äôt halt the stock 50 times on the way up while you only halted a few times when it does the same movement it‚Äôs way down.    Now the boomer media coming after this fraudulent activities with ‚Äûwe told you so‚Äú and blaming the ‚ÄûReddit investors‚Äú for the plunge and stating that their loss their interest and are selling now. When dump shorter shorts more than 100% of the available free float and are not willing to pay the price, then the side of the trade is evil and dump for doing a rational good trade?   Fuck this free market. It‚Äôs only a free market as long they win. If they start to lose in this Game they change the rules, the referee choosing their side, and the camera man on the field doesn‚Äôt Films the fouls of them. Instead they showing the innocent as evil and ‚ÄûMust be punished‚Äú type of folks
YOU RETARDS - WARREN BUFFET SAID WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ACCURATE!
GME strategy for diamond hands who bought at peak
Hello apes,  Inspired by Marc Cuban who said to hold long term, here is a quick calculator for you on how much dip you need to buy to end up in the green long term:  S1 = current average purchase price S2 = dip price ST = target average price NC = current number of shares X = number of shares to buy  (S1 NC + S2 X) /(NC + X) = ST  X = (S1 NC - NC ST) / (ST - S2)  Cost to pay: X S2  __________________________ Example:  Current 10 shares at 200$  Assuming GME dropped to 1$ Target average price of 2$  X = ( 200 10 - 2 10)/(2-1)= 1980 shares  Cost to pay: 1980 1= 1980$  New position: 1990 shares @ 2$ Total investment: 3990$ _________________________  Now wait for GME to tick from 2$ to 3$ and you are in the green  Have fun  Not financial advice, just ape
You bet your ass im still holding! My buying power should give me 2 more shares tomorrow if the sale continues. I've recovered from down 95% three times in my time on WSB, everytime I've come back stronger than ever
Dove head first into concrete to get my 1 share. I Retard, I HOLD.

No ape shit: the Shorts are simply preparing for the squeeze
Disclaimer: I eat crayons for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is not financial advice. This is not legal advice. I legit think I must be deep one way on the spectrum cause i like it here.   Remove emotion from this if you can. I recommend /r/Stoicism. There are posts there already addressing this situation.  The Shorts are simply preparing (unsure if it's all legal but whatever, I'm trying not to visualise them as human as much as they are simply the other side of the equation. Also, punitive damages at this stage is still a drop in the ocean compared to handling this situation as best as fiscally possible.  They know their pushing the law too and it should be good news for a Long position to see this. If you've ever been through a legal process, you know when the other side is pulling out ridiculous shit that they reek of desperation).  The deeper we get into their play book, the better.   The key battles were igniting this whole thing, which we did, and the other one last Friday to get those calls ITM, which we did. This past Monday and Tuesday is not as important mathematically as those key events. Sure, $360->$90 looks like a win, and in some ways it really is a win for the shorts. Just like how the Longs have notched a few good battles too. I mean no shit, they're a pretty good opponent, right?!     tl;dr: The other side is preparing as best they can. What else would you expect? Remove your emotions.  The other side is in damage control. Unless you seriously expect them to get this to zero, why wouldn't you hold? The more legal lines they cross, the better.     Also, yesterday there were heaps $800 calls purchased.

The Truth about the State of the Sub
Ok guys, I‚Äôm happy about what has happened with GME, and the rest of the BANG stonks, honestly. It‚Äôs inspired a real look into the inner workings of the markets, and fucked over some hedge funds who were more likely than not doing shady things. If any legal victories come of this, whether they create limits on shorting to be under 100% of float, or not allowing market makers to double dip, whatever it is, there may actually be something positive that comes from this on that front.   That being said - this isn‚Äôt only a GME sub, and I‚Äôm not here for a fucking cause, to make some political statement, or cry about manipulation all day. You know why a lot of the original people joined this sub years ago? It was to make fuckin money! Share non conventional ideas, go balls deep on some wild plays, YOLO on earnings, share the memes, win or lose with my retarded brothers in arms. If you made money on GME and rode the wave then I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you. If you use a real broker and shorted GME at 420 because that‚Äôs how you were going to make your fucking tendies, I‚Äôm also happy for you. We‚Äôre losing our luster and anything else that‚Äôs not GME and co is getting downvoted to shit or drowned out.   You know what this sub isn‚Äôt about? The information echo chamber and hive mind bullshit that pervades the rest of Reddit. I actually hated Reddit and made an account years ago but really only got into it because of this sub. You post some conspiracy theory bullshit about how every institution is conspiring to ruin the retail traders because GME is down today? Fuck you, you‚Äôre a fucking idiot because the reality is more institutions actually made money off of this rocketing up than lost by shorting against it. Who did we hurt? 3 hedge funds? Fuck guys come on. You know how much big money was behind this move too? It‚Äôs just as plausible that all the bots people are worried about are actually from longs, convincing everyone to stay in so institutions can unload the bags onto retail. In fact, it‚Äôs actually more likely because like I said, there are more of them on our side who rode the wave up, than the 3 we hurt by it going up. Ever fucking think of that?   I expect better, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with having more people in the sub as someone who‚Äôs been here since like 300k. But you gotta actually cut the shit and put real effort into some of these posts, and know that it‚Äôs not about conspiring against the world of institutional investing. It‚Äôs about making fucking money - that‚Äôs it.   Wanna know what the best thing about the investment world is? If you don‚Äôt like a fucking trade, you can take the other side of it, or you can not play it at all! We used to have people that bet against each other on the reg, and you know what‚Äôs beautiful about that dynamic? We shared our losses and our victories and owned up to it, together. It wasn‚Äôt a conspiracy sub, it was a sub of autists who won and lost together, even if they were on different sides, with the end goal of get rich or die trying. You would all learn from looking at the history of the sub and some of the quality we used to have. Please, for the sake of keeping this an actually good community, chill the fuck out.  TLDR- MAKE WALLSTREETBETS GREAT AGAIN
Dropped 300k on the DIP   there's more upside than downside from here! Let's GO

I am helping you idiots out. I joined WSB a week or two ago. No worries I won't sell my shares. To be honest I don't like how this red colour clashes with the nice green colour. I am sorry I just bought my first home or I would have helped out more. I will do what I can. Payday next Week
I couldn't take the GME risk anymore, decided to put my remaining gains into something much safer. Pleas Fly Again
If you sell now, you don't understand the core principal of trading.
Autist incoming. A lot of retards made their first trade with GME. Awesome and welcome!  With inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:  # BUY LOW SELL HIGH.   The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.   You never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally   BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!   If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES  -> DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).  It's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.  Even if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.  I KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.  Some more autistic shit  # Percieved Value:  Remember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.  Now the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.  When selling at $100 -> YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.  Plus: Loss Aversion  A loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.     HOLD TODAY  HOLD TOMORROW  HOLD FOREVER  IF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.     THIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.     EDIT:  Since WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -> I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.  I only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last "WSB" move I'm gonna do.   It doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.  Buy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME.   If you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.  Even if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss.
Held Tesla for 2 years and now    ! GME loss is just rocket fuel. Stay strong silverback!
Tomorrow is going to be a better day. Wall Street is going to lose to a bunch of   with those   . Also, eat ass Melvin.

Looks green to me GME TO THE MOON!     (or crash back into the launch pad and explode)
Cannabis stocks have turned into STONKS - my smooth-brain DD
Listen here my fellow retards, my patience is running out on giving you free advice. I know short term meme stocks seem to be all the rage these days, but I believe the real tendies are being produced from the cannabis sector.   MSOS (Cannabis ETF) is up 6% today and has already gone up \~25% on the year. Basically all the cannabis stocks have been exploding these past few months. I don't see this growth slowly down anytime soon and here are some reasons why.    Both the   US and Mexico   are closing in on   federally legalizing cannabis  . Both of these countries are going to offer huge markets that will combine to be far bigger than Canada's current market.     More people are doing the 420  . Usage is going up everywhere and I don't see it dropping in the near future.   Lots of cannabis companies are   getting majorly shorted   which is keeping their stock price down instead of going to the MOOOON     Wouldn't be a fair DD without some risks though.....    Although   US and Mexico   are strongly considering federal legalization, it   could still go south  . Backlash from legalizing or more important and pressing issues could easily push it to the back-burner or kill the idea all together for the near future.   Although many health studies are coming out listing the benefits of cannabis, if some   serious health side-effects   come out in some studies it could scare people away from smoking the weed.   There are far too many companies and lots of them are going to go   bankrupt   probably. Lots of room to get unlucky in your choices.  So what cannabis stonks should I be YOLOing into? A better first question might be: What should I be looking for in a cannabis stock?.      Profitable or near it:   Once the market really explodes it is going to be the companies with the cleanest balance sheets that are going to be able to make the big moves and print the real tendies. The companies with piles of debt and minimal profit will be left in the dust.     Has a foothold in multiple countries:   The more countries, states, licenses, land, etc., the better. All of these will allow for a head-start in the markets in that area.     Undervalued:   with lots of the cannabis stocks getting shorted to death, there are some cannabis stocks out there that I believe are extremely undervalued.  So what are your recommendations Mr. Smooth Brain?      APHA:   Tilray and Aphria are in the works of a serious and huge merger that will see them becoming one of (if not the biggest) cannabis company. Aphria's financials continue to be promising and Tilray's are not as solid but still decent. Aphria also acquired SweatWater giving them a solid start on cannabis related beverages. Aphria is the largest cannabis producer in Canada at   ( .   So why APHA and not TLRY? When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. Because of this it is safe to assume APHA share price should =   x TLRY share price. TLRY share price is currently $25 which would mean that APHA share price should be around $20. For this reason APHA price being $15 right now is a steal assuming the merger goes through (looking promising for the merger to happen in Q2 this year).            I know what you are thinking.... "this gay boomer bear smooth brain thinks a penny stock is a good idea!?!".... hear me out. Supreme cannabis is one of those companies that never quite reached potential in the initial Canadian cannabis boom. Never had a real profitable quarter and has since been crushed to the ground by shorts ( . It has mostly been treated as just a dead stock and over the last few months people have dumbed on me for even mentioning this stock.   I believe this is all about to turn around though. Supreme is having an earnings call on February 11th where I expect an extremely promising financial report and exciting upcoming news. Considering how undervalued this stock is (97 million market cap) it isn't going to take much to get this stock exploding. Volume and shorts have been exploding in this stock which shows huge promise. Supreme also makes up 3% of cannabis retail market in Canada ( . They also have connections in Australia and Israel markets.     There are many more promising cannabis stonks out there and I encourage my fellow smooth brains to do their DD. Companies operating in multiple states are a safe bet ( .   Lots are coming out with earnings in the next few weeks, so keep your eyes out and remember to exercise those      My positions: APHA 20@$7, SPRWF 4480@$ , (I know... r/babystreetbets)..... I plan on dumping more into APHA and doubling down on SPRWF after earnings come out.    TLDR  : Cannabis STONKS      . Exercise your    and HOLD. IMO buy APHA and risk it on SPRWF, but do your own DD on cannabis stonks.

Real talk for those feeling like they got left holding the bag
Hey... so you bought in GME at $350 and sold at $90 and now you‚Äôre left with a lot less money then you started with. You‚Äôre feeling pretty down, but guess what - it‚Äôs OK, we‚Äôve all been there! Chances are every other successful investor out there have made mistakes in the past at some point, but you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try again if you want to become a billionaire stock trader. You just need to think about the lessons you‚Äôve learned over this and try not to make them again. Seriously, most of the shit i do is a result of knowing what NOT to do vs. being successful at something.  For reference, here are some lessons I‚Äôve learned over years of making dogshit mistakes investing:    have a system and stick with it (  screen stocks and make sure you only buy stocks with 20% insider ownership, a business model you understand, etc).   have an exit strategy. If or when are you planning on selling?   how would i feel about the volatility about this investment? If it dropped 50% would i pull my money out?   talk through large investing decisions with a really good friend or partner. Get them to poke holes in your theories... you might find what made sense in your head actually was dumb as hell.   trade in a tax efficient vehicle so you don‚Äôt get dinged by the IRS.   if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is (i once literally bought speakers out of a van with my last $300, and they didn‚Äôt work... just lmao).   chances are all this time dedicated to this whole stock thing isn‚Äôt worth it because investing 100% in VTI will beat your picks most years (and you‚Äôll be a lot less stressed out)   people like Chamath, Portnoy, Cuban, AOC, Cruz, are just inflating their own ego and Twitter clout by appearing like they‚Äôre on one side vs another. They actually don‚Äôt give a shit about you.  Anyway, just wanted to throw out a note for those not feeling that great right now. I see you and feel for you and we‚Äôve all been there ü§†. Maybe some other WSBers can share lessons or war stories to help other newbies.

Why would they ever need to close?
Not a bot. Promise.  The idea is that HF are loosing billions in interest payments? And so they cannot afford to hold their positions for very long? Right?  Well, the interest they pay is based on the stock price. Which, as we have seen, they control.  If apes diamond hand, and don't sell. Why couldn't they just short ladder the price back down to $20 and have more reasonable interest payments?  Tldr; If they control the price, they have no reason to ever close their positions.

What comes to mind when you think of BlackBerry? Phones? Your a chump if you answered phones.  TLDR up front, BlackBerry has pivoted away from making phones and instead is in the software sector. Some big names that they have include,      Software    BlackBerry has gone away from the phones business and has reinvented itself to become the main player in Automobile OS systems. They have lock and key in this market since many OEMs don't want to start from the ground up making the software themselves. As of June,2020 they have the QNS software in over  Not to mention the companies that use QNX are subscription based, so reoccurring revenue.

GME - If you don't have Diamond Hands    , stop checking your portfolio, Involve yourself in work, gardening, cook something but if you keep checking the market every 5 mins, you will get paranoid and will try to sell as soon as you break even and that's more dangerous - don't cave in !!!

DD on APHA
I think it is time I make a DD post that has nothing to do with a meme stonk. I am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but I promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner.  Why should you trust me?  I am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales. I love money more than hookers love blow and I intend on making a lot of money so I can afford the hookers that like blow. I go to a pretty prestigious university and I love how WallStreetBets can connect "smart" money with "autist" money. I am 100% all in on APHA with my entire life savings because as Warren Buffett would say, " "  Diversification   is a protection against ignorance," "\[It\] makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing."  and I know what I am doing so I full sent it.     Why APHA?  They are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first. Compared to other marijuana companies like ACB or Tilray, they aren't riddled with debt right off the back. (i'll get to the Tilray merger in a bit). This company has the cash on hand to purchase a MSO (multi-state operator) as soon as the US legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a MSO that has a heavy presence in Florida as the CFO stated in an AMA on reddit that Florida is where the market is, not California. The difference between APHA and any MSO or other LP is the fact that APHA merging with Tilray creates the first MCO or Multi-country operator. This means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes. You don't need to be #1 in America or Canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be #1 worldwide.     With APHA and Tilray merging... which stonk do you buy? Easy, APHA.  The arbitrage play has APHA being changed to .83 of 1 Tilray share.  Currently tilray trades at   x   =    The current APHA price?    This means that the gap has to close before the merger but is Tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out? No, APHA has to go up to close the gap and today alone APHA is up   based on pro marijuana legalization news. BUT WAIT! Tilray is up   which means the GAP IS ONLY GETTING WIDER just like your wife's pussy after letting her 5 boyfriends have a turn since you've been so busy focusing on your GME stonk going down due to market manipulation.     The financials of APHA are strong, they FINALLY posted a profit of   EPS which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies haven't hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game. The one great thing about their financials is that Sweetwater Brewing wasn't factored into the earnings report which is AWESOME (Insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here). They are already turning a profit and THEN they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet. While other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season, APHA has a raft to float on since Sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company. (I will post all relevant news articles at the end). The merge with Tilray makes this combined company a player in, Canada, Portugal, France, and then Sweetwater gives them US brand recognition. How does a beer company give US brand recognition? Look up the Sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what APHA needed. Right now the stock is stilling at $15 which is still relatively low, I can see this hitting anywhere from $50-75 EOY and like I said, I have my entire life savings in this stonk because I know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next Anheuser Busch which APHA is best positioned to become.  There's even more reasons to invest but I'm sure you get the point. This is going to be huge and if you're looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option. Go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions. I made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when WSB wasn't only about GME and AMC but also new emerging sectors. This is a great stock and I wouldn't have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching. Listen or don't I am gonna make tendies, I just want to share the wealth.                    Sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked. They are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for APHA/Tilray to distribute their product through. Imagine already having warehouses, sales reps, and shipping routes established before the US legalizes. APHA is going to be an MSO and MCO. The only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they don't want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs. Could go both ways but Sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationships/brand recognition that will already be established before any other LPs can get into the market will have APHA/Tilray the clear cut winner of the LPs. I strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit Weedstocks rather than spamming WSB with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it. I have been a member of WSB and Weedstocks for over a year and both subs have their pros and cons.        READ THIS FOR INFO ON ARBITRAGE PLAY

I didn‚Äôt think I need to explain this. This is for new people getting intimated by the volume today and seeing it was higher compared to yesterday and are wondering why the price is still down. What happened on open was a decline downwards all the way down to $70-80 running on LITERALLY the same amount of volume yesterday at around 20-30 million, but as it hit $70-$80 you beautiful fuckers    didn‚Äôt sell but instead gobbled that shit up all the way to $140 hence the spike in volume. When it went down again to $90 at closing you can see that the volume is also low similar to the decline at open.  Theoretically if they just kept reducing the price and no one bought but held we would have closed lower than $90 and would have definitely closed with close to the same amount of volume as yesterday . I feel like people are missing the fact that it didn‚Äôt just go down in price it also went up.  TL:DR YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARDS ARE HOLDING WITH 69 KARAT DIAMOND HANDS.     VOLUME INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE RUN UP FROM $70-$80 @OPEN TO $140.  THE DECLINE DOWNWARDS AND THE DECLINE AFTER THE RUN UP WAS TRADING WITH SIMILAR VOLUME AS YESTERDAY! THEORETICALLY IF NO ONE BOUGHT THOSE DISCOUNTED PRICES AND RAN IT UP WE WOULD BE CLOSING AT AN EVEN LOWER PRICE FROM $90 AND SIMILAR LOW VOLUMES AS YESTERDAY!    (Not a financial advisor I just like the stock)
Still holding!    The rocket is filled up and ready for Mars  ! what do you think is the rocket fuel?... You retards. buy ! HOLD!
The ratio of short volume to total volume confirms the GME sell-off over the last few days is shorting, not real selling. GME
Many people here have pointed out that this selling seems artificial, multiple brokers report overwhelming buy orders, etc. The official data are in complete agreement with that. S3 and Ortex data are estimates, but FINRA data (from which the bimonthly official short interest reports are generated; this is the best there is) have shown that for the last five days, more than 50% of shares sold have been sold short:        As an aside, according to that second website, ["if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \  SEC, a little help, please?  In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than    50%    of  all GME shares sold  were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.  This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon ( , official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.  I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.  # Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?  No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.  # The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded  Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the  ratio  of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.     Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME.     TLDR:   Shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days. Keep holding, don't sell, and when you can buy more buy more.   GME to fucking Orion's belt

Why AMC is Trash and why you should not hold
I was going to post a long drawn out message about why AMC has potential and why we should believe in them in the long run but all that got tossed out the window when I eventually came across their Movie Streaming service:  .  I'll start by explaining the difference between Box Office sales vs Streaming.  Streaming is like DVD sales, where the production company must sign over rights to the movie to the service which eliminates any chance at residuals such as Box Office sales which is where a majority of their profit lies.  My theory is that this is why we've only very few "good" movies recently, most of the production companies are sitting on their canned file waiting for COVID to be over.  Why I think AMC dropped the ball...  AMC, like other movie theaters already have agreements in place to share "Box Office" proceeds with the production companies.  I'm not sure why they wouldn't get creative and offer this same model up during COVID and get a leg up on their competition (Amazon, Google, etc...).  My guess, the same reason that I had to spend an hour doing DD just to find out that the only reason I could see them being viable into the future, they ALREADY had a product for and just don't do anything with.  Their leadership is completely incompetent and the company was being shorted into bankruptcy for a reason.  AVOID AMC like the fucking plague stock that it is...
One word.... HOLD

News writers/on show personalities who are willing to whistleblow.
What's the talk like behind the scenes at the news/paper station.  Is management guiding you to a story, telling you to put reddit/GME in a bad light.  Is there multiple stories being written and only the stuff producers want to be written being filtered through?  How did Silver become a thing? like nobody cares about it here but EVERY news outlet was trying to make it a thing.  It's sad that Gamestop is what makes me believe Fake News is a thing more than any blondish haired man ever did during his 4 years screaming it. Also if anyone honestly answers this on a throwaway even if it's vague, thank you.
I would buy more if I could

Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANT
I like many of you work a shit job where I'm underpaid, exploited, stressed and angry. Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.  So that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead. I've been exploited by shit jobs, government who doesn't give a shit about me (hey here's two measiy still checks to compensate for another 10 years of no wage growth) and now a fucking financial system so fucking rigged that even criminals like Pablo Escobar would in awe if he were alive. Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.  So I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will. These fucking banker and financial cunts need to lose and suffer like we do daily. They don't know what it's like to enyer a shit job market and be stuck in it for a fucking decade and ask for fucking tax breaks and still do illegal shit like blatantly manipularlte the free market.  I've platinumed Battlefield 4 and over 30 other games. Who do you think you're missing with? If u/deepfuckingvalue can hold and the other troopers around the world I sure as hell can. Do you know why it's not about the money anymore         $10000          it's about being on the right side or history and doing what's right.  I'm fucking holding. Fuck you hedgefunds.  #powertotheplayers #getthatplatinum
Money well spent! Thanks guys for reassuring not to sell.

An important aspect of trading emotionally is valuing integrity and morality. An emotional trader must, above all else, think of the repercussions their investments may have on the world at large. Could you really sleep at night knowing that you are personally funding terrorists or child exploitation?    The answer is no.   ____  The impact buying or selling shares has on other people is often conveniently overlooked. Mainstream investors, teachers, and self-proclaimed gurus choose to ignore the broader implications of these interpersonal interactions out of moral convenience. To them, that which is not seen, can do no harm. This culture of permissiveness is in violation of human dignity. Every trade that is made, every contract that is processed, is a personal transaction, that of which dates back to Babylonian times. The biggest implication of the result of this shift in perspective surrounds the idea of bag holding.    Outside of the world of finance, bag holding refers to a form of common courtesy.   That is, if you were to perhaps see an elderly woman holding many bags of shopping, one might partake in bag holding such that said elderly woman was disencumbered.  In the realm of investing, this socially positive term has been  twisted  to refer to traders who refuse to sell shares cheaply. This term is often employed by market manipulators as well as losers who sold and are looking for reaffirmation that they are not alone in their losses.  An interpersonal perspective helps an outsider understand what the emotional investor is doing, and sheds light on the concept of bag holding. Once again, human behavior imitates life. Kind-hearted individuals hold the metaphysical bags of those who cannot afford to (the ‚Äúold women‚Äù in this metaphor). That is, those who are strong, have more wealth available to trade, take on the burden of those who cannot, the old women.  Indeed a cold, heartless view of  markets and investing may lead some to believe that it is okay to let old women struggle and fail whilst attempting to cross the street carrying groceries. However, experienced investors will attest to the moral duty we as humans must carry in the advancement, not only of ourselves, but of the weakest among us.    Life changing realizations of this nature have powerful impacts on our lives.    As a coping mechanism, I suggest to you that   crying   is the most efficient method of displaying sadness and sorrow in these situations,   not selling  . Sobs are a universal sign of distress, discontent, and loss. As such, tears may be seen as a commodity. Although an emotional investor will, at all times, avoid selling, and above all else, avoid being a loser, there are particular situations where there simply may not be a lesson to exchange for the sale of your position. That is to say, there may be nothing to learn.  _____   TLDR    In days like today, an intelligent well-trained emotional investor will fall back to basic principles of loss aversion and exchange their losses for their value equivalent in tears. In fact, tears may be the most valuable commodity of all.   Only losers sell  . Serious investors learn. Serious investors   cry  .

If there is a short squeeze here is why it will happen before the 9th.
So before I start. I AM retarded. I may be wrong and this is not advise at all to buy or sell.  That being said here is why I think that the squeeze, if it‚Äôs real, will happen before the 9th  BACKGROUND;   When this whole thing started, it started because many traders realized the potential for there to be a squeeze, when realizing this, the stock sky rocketed to my anus and Uranus and everyone‚Äôs anus. The important thing to note is that this happened because of a mix of gamma and short squeeze (But not THE wet dream short squeeze everyone is referring too)  When / if the squeeze happens there won‚Äôt be a run up like before, most people who are hyped about this already bought. (there is only so much money in traders accounts)  it will likely happen in waves of huge green dildos as companies rush to buy back before another short company buys first and raises the price for them.  They will all try to fight each other because if one company buys back, they are screwing over the others. Which means waves of price increases   What does this have to do with the 9th?  Well on the 9th we will see how many shares are shorted, looking back at how this all started we see it was because of people realizing short interest was high.   TWO SCENARIOS:   Scenario 1;   If on the 9th people see they haven‚Äôt covered their shorts or only partially covered and the short interest is still high then the buying frenzy will re ignite and the price will shoot as people wait for the short squeeze.  This is very bad for the company. This means that if the short interest IS high then they would want to buy back before the 9th that way people don‚Äôt have much time to react and raise their limit sells when they see the short interest percent.   Scenario 2;   Short interest is low and we are fucked. Not much to be said here. No short squeeze   One last thing. The squeeze (if it happens) will happen after a red day because these companies will want to lower the will of shareholders as much as they possibly could to incentivize them to sell at the first sign of green   TLDR: when monkeys see numbers of short interest on the 9th one two things will happen  1: it‚Äôs high and the squeeze begins before the numbers are revealed so monkey can‚Äôt react.  2: bulls are fuk

How do you guys not go crazy? I went from 3k to 40k before they started manipulating the market. I felt amazing. I was so ready to move my money to other investments, I was gonna buy what family I have and my girlfriend gifts, people were so happy for me... I held and held and the last two days have absolutely destroyed me. I‚Äôve never felt so high and then so low. I lost 33k man. I‚Äôm still up 3k which is something but it‚Äôs not the life changing money I saw just 2 days ago. I‚Äôve been having a nervous break down all day man. The world feels like it‚Äôs at it‚Äôs at a breaking point, I‚Äôve been taking care of my dying grandparents the entirety of quarantine, my fucking job is gone bc of covid and I‚Äôm stuck working part time at a shitty job. Both of my parents are dead, I found my uncles body last year. Everyone I love is dead. I feel like I ruined the one chance I had to change my life and I‚Äôm fucking crumbling under the pressure.  I sold my 2 $300 gme calls at $96 and literally not not even 3 mins laters RH opens GME for trading and the stock ran up to high 140s. I‚Äôve ever slapped myself in the face so hard.

SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?
Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!         First off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.      This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc   \ \ WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\ \  I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.  Here's our biggest problem:   Misinformation    There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.  How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit?   By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now  . That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.    A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME    1.   Fundamental Value:   This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture. 2.   Momentum:   This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider:   Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -   rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen. 3.   THE SHORT SQUEEZE:   What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price.  Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?   If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey. 4.   The Gamma Squeeze:   Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe.   But a gamma squeeze can also backfire  . All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace. 5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:    1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.    2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling    3. A massive media   to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver    4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),    5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.       OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS       WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?        No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.    Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high      Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This  may  translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.   Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?      S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only   51% of free float  :Source:            Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source:              REAL DATA:   The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\ \ On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\ \ The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.   Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?      I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?      Yahoo Finance puts Float at   mil shares, FWIWSource:      Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close      Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.   Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.   Date Trade Volume   :- :-   2/2 Tue     2/1 Mon     1/29 Fri     1/28 Thu     1/27 Wed       Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming      Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.   Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit   Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further       Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.      Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.   Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS   Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source:         Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.     Evidence needed:   Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.   Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.       Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods      Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.   Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices                 Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself:     Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\   Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?   Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:          Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'      Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.   Evidence: A single, solitary chart       Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't  there ?   Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play        Will edit with more, my primate fingers are hurting from trying to press the keys and my handler needs to readjust my helmet.

Would I have sold looking back?   I could buy this delicious dip for my trip on this ship      . This one hurt.

Lost big on the $NOK hype
LET ME BE CLEAR
No financial advice of course, I'm a retard.   You're at a loss? No point selling now that takes you out of the game (therefore no chance of winning) you have nothing to lose at this point.  Volume is high as fuck still so they are forcing the price down artificially. No question. So when their shorts come home to roost, the price will literally rocket up as long as everyone holds (diamond hands  ‚úä)  It might not be tomorrow it might not even be until Friday maybe even next week but you've got to be patient that's why you don't invest money you need because you might just lose it. Both GME and AMC will go up. (Looked at AMC's numbers closely tonight I think we are close to launch off)  AMC is a great stock anyway and after the pandemic it will naturally rise back up to $25/30 (I'm currently 50 shares deep at $  (That's about a profit of $750 WORST CASE SCENARIO)  Everyone relax and stop listening to the bots in the threads that are saying they are selling. 95% of people are buying.   Hedge funders can hold my balls while I hold AMC and GME.

Short interest is not updated daily. The "squeeze" already happened.
Limitations of the Short Interest Ratio  "The short interest ratio has several flaws, the first being that is not updated regularly. Short interest is reported every two weeks and is usually as of the 15th and the last day of the month. It takes several days before the information is published and by that time, the number of shares short in the market may have already changed."  Short likely were covering as the price increased. Now I agree that GME was manipulated and if it were not it likely could have run to 1K while other stocks may have run up higher too like AMC. However I really hope everyone understands that GME likely never sees those highs again. Furthermore this spamming of "Hold" is probably making the majority of WSB lose money.  All in all the squeeze was right and the manipulation did happen but the top was last week and it's not coming back.

Let us unite again - a discussion
Hello brothers. It has been quite the start of the week. The shorts have not won the battle of GameStop or AMC.   While these battles rage on there are many more. While I fully support the GME & AMC run I noticed the new steam brewing about a silver squeeze.   The idea of a silver squeeze was quickly turned down and here at WSB due to Citadel owning many calls on SLV and other tickers.   But we must notice the bigger picture here, JP Morgan is a huge player in the manipulation of these commodities and they should be held accountable.  They are just as bad as citadel, we must remember the message behind the run ups on GME AMC and more. This same message might actually apply to silver. I think it might actually be worth looking into brothers, this is a potentially good choice, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking is for you to double check the situation of silver.  Ape together strong, long GME AMC.  Edit: remember the message boys, the reason behind the trades, let us learn and expand our expertise on these specific set of requirements and logistics in the future. Stay true to the message and meaning.
Not selling! Screw them!
$MGNI: Why it is STILL a great time to buy in
TL/DR at the bottom    I do not see nearly enough love for MGNI on r/stocks or WSB so I want to give you all a look in at a one-way ticket to gains.    What does Magnite ($MGNI) do?    \-   World‚Äôs largest independent supply-side advertising technology company  . This means they help fill advertising space, primarily on websites, apps, and   connected TV (CTV)   platforms. Price per share at time of writing: $     CTV -   Basically anything that is not cable TV is connected TV. Connecting through your xbox or roku or apple TV or however you want to stream TV. This is the   primary source of revenue   for $MGNI. Are you on the poor people version of Hulu that runs ads? Those ads run through MGNI.  So let me ask you - is there a movement towards cable TV, or a movement towards finding other ways to watch TV through streaming services? I think you know the answer. And that is reason #1 to buy in.   As CTV increases in popularity, so does demand for advertising space, and so does $MGNI revenue.      Industry comparison -    Trade Desk ($TTD). TTD operates on the buy side of ad tech, so while not exactly the same, they are within the same industry. TTD is currently   up 2800%   over the last 4 years, with a market cap of $  billion. Where is $MGNI? A shade under $5 billion. Now is it realistic to expect MGNI to be the next home run play like TTD (who my brother sold for $50/share, RIP)? Predicting anything to go up 2800% in 4 years is unlikely but who knows. But   if MGNI can get to even half the market cap of TTD, that is a price target of $160.   (Current: $40/share, Mcap   Billion)    Past/future earnings:    Past earnings and future earnings show the story of a company with fairly rapid growth. Take a look for yourself:  Q1 2020 Revenue - $ , up 12% YoY from Q1 2019  Q2 2020 Revenue - $ , up 12% YoY from Q2 2019  Q3 2020 Revenue - $61MM, up 62% YoY from Q3 2019   Q4 2020 Revenue - Expected $72-75MM, up \~50% YoY from Q4 2019     $MGNI is up %335 in the past 12 mo, am I too late to the party?    Answer:   NO,   and although I already outlined some reasons why above, here is a list for you:     1. CTV will      only increase in popularity, which is where the bulk of MGNI revenue comes      from 2. $MGNI is      showing accelerated growth, great for a mid-cap company to try to make the      jump to large-cap 3. Trade Desk      (TTD), who is not a competitor but is in the same industry, is valued      nearly 10x higher than MGNI. 4. Earnings      coming up 2/24, which I expect MGNI to crush, and I do not think that      earnings are priced in yet. 5. Needham      analyst Laura Martin makes MGNI her top pick for 2021, saying 500% growth      is possible (Jan 13   6. Survived a      short hit piece by Spruce Point Capital on Jan 8 (Thank you for a low      entry point for some calls) 7.   PR Today: Launch of ‚ÄúUnified Decisioning‚Äù,   a new MGNI product/software. From article:   ‚ÄúPublishers are eager to tap into the efficiencies that programmatic provides without relinquishing the control they are used to when selling directly to buyers. Unified Decisioning enables them to do both and we‚Äôre excited to bring these capabilities to leading CTV publishers.‚Äù  Link:    If you‚Äôre interested in companies that are trending from bottom-left to top-right, then I encourage you to invest in $MGNI. I believe it is a   good short-term play  ; having just went on a weeklong dip from Jan 22 - Jan 29, I think you have a decent entry point here at $ , although I believe any entry point is fine at this stage in the company‚Äôs growth. Also in the short-term is earnings on 2/24 which I believe will be good for MGNI. It is also a   good long-term play   for reasons above, my EOY price target is $125, although it would not surprise me if it goes significantly higher. The $MGNI train hasn‚Äôt even left the station!  Positions: 100 shares @ $16, 2/19 35c x5, 2/19 40c x2, 2/19 45c x10, 2/19 50c x2 (Slight degeneracy)    TL/DR:   MGNI is a growing company in the growing industry of advertising in (primarily) connected TV services (Think: Roku). Same realm as $TTD but 1/10th the market cap. Much room to grow. Earnings coming up 2/24 and Laura Martin‚Äôs stock pick of 2021. Just released beta of new software today. Not financial advice, I just like the stock.
Why the guy I saw on r/stocks is a smooth brained mouth breather, or why I still have diamond hands
I saw post over on r/stocks earlier today.  I'm ngl, it freaked me the fuck out like some sort of anti-moon tardo.  I totally fell for the FUD as my beloved rocket stonk continues to swan dive into my wife's boyfriends bunghole.  So onto why the pheasant's FUD ended up only causing an hours long instead of perma brain damage.  BECAUSE HE IS A SMOOTH MOUTH BREATHER:  1. Fact one: Buying has been greater than selling. Buying has been greater than selling. Everyone knows that if we buy and hold, a payday will come at some point thanks to the hedgies continuing to double down on GME shorts. 2. Fact two: multiple stonks have mirrored movement.  See AMC for an example. 3. Fact three: Volume is too fucking low.  Volume was only 77mil today looking at RH. 4. Fact four: the hedgies aren't closing their positions, see #3.  There are no more shares available to short. 5. Fact five: I haven't gone FULL retard.  Never go FULL retard.     My personal opinion is that we are never going to be able to build up enough momentum alone to turn this thing around.  But we don't have to.  We do not need momentum anymore, we just need to maintain scarcity of the shorted stocks.  Literally, just need to hold until the hedgies starts to close their positions, hold for as long as possible, then its all over.  This isn't a bubble, this isn't some overblown hype train, this is just the way of these meme stonks.    This isn't a get rich quick scheme, this is buying tickets to the squeeze show.  Tickets just went on discount.  Anyone bailing is a smoothed brained pheasant.  Fuck you, fight me in the Wendy's. I am an alpha ape with a big pp. \ spams emojis\

Vanguard is restricting trading with newly deposited funds.
I opened a Vanguard account two or three days ago to skrrr on Robinghood. I asked my wife's bf for some money, made a deposit, and started the verification process. Today, Vanguard finished verifying my account via the "what amounts did we deposit into your account" method. I went to bet my entire account balance on GME, and it wouldn't let me, because of "insufficient funds". I tried buying BBBY instead, because my wife's bf likes their lotion, and same thing.  I called their customer service and held for TWO HOURS just for them to tell me, "new rules cause of mArKeT vOlAtIlItY. All you can buy for the first seven days after your deposit is Vanguard ETF's and and Vanguard mutual funds". The reason they gave was that they need to wait for the money to clear the entire banking system.   I guess next I'm trying Fidelity but doubt I'll be able to get in before the squeeze, especially since Vanguard is holding my lunch money hostage. Wife's bf is gonna be pissed.  TLDR: read the title. Try Fidelity. Hold the fucking line.

This may be the right way to support GME for long term success, and get rewarded as a real shareholder.
Just a thought, what if 8 million WSB retards forget about the short squeeze, instead, slowly accumulate shares with hard earned cash (not the money borrowed from your wife's boyfriend, not margin).  Many of us just like the company. If each retard accumulates 18 shares.... we would own 200% of the whole company. And nobody says you can't have more than 18 shares.  Then we all support Ryan and his team to build GME into a trillion dollar company. GME could grow into an online giant in gaming, finance, news, online brokerage...... The company would have 8 million loyal customers on day one!
The whole time ive been invested in the stock market (about 7 months) Ive always been scared to lose the money ive put in which has resulted in mostly paper handed bitch shit. Regardless, as soon as it became clear to me what this was, those fears subsided and havent returned.
Post bloodbath thoughts: How many are still in the middle of changing brokerages?
So after RH giving it to us all dry, I know a lot of us switched brokerages. Luckily I had opened a Webull and a Fidelity account 2 weeks before, but didn't have any free/settled cash. So... Double F-ed on buying. Anyway...  The question this   has, is how many people are still stuck between brokerages?  I want to see us all Needlers blazing and imploding HF's again.     Positions:  AMC - 85 shares @ \~ $  ( was $4-something before I bought more)  GME - 5 shares @ \~ $179 (I bought 2 more yest at $270)  NOK - 50 shares @ \~$   Need to see this shit    - My GF's real boyfriend is expecting something nice for V-day.

What is going on with $GME‚Äôs Stats???  ‚ú®
Currently holding 25 Shares of GME at about $104 average price. Today shook me, not gonna lie, as a college student it's scary to lose thousands of $$$ in minutes but these hands are diamond!!  üèª   Anyway, what is confusing me about all this is the statistics, maybe its because I'm a retarded tendie loving idiot, so maybe someone could explain to me what I'm seeing.  On Yahoo Finance, It says that the percentage of shares owned by insiders is   and the percentage of shares held by institutions is   How can there be more than 100% of a company? & that's not even including retail investors (or maybe it does, again, I'm retarded)  Okay, that seems weird but what about this other stuff? like the fact that there are supposed to be a total of 69,000,000 shares outstanding, yet over 61,000,000 shares are shorted? is it really possible for there to be less than 8,000,000 shares that aren't being shorted? and if that was the case wouldn't there be no way for us (retail investors) to bring the price up at all? ü§îü§îü§î  Also, the short percentage of the float is   for Gamestop when I did research into the other top shorted stocks, Bed Bath and Beyond was mentioned so I decided to check their statistics versus Gamestop, and their percentage of the float was 82%.   So i decided to compare the numbers of the Top 5 ‚ÄúBest Heavily Shorted Stocks To Buy Right Now‚Äù from   üìà  just look at the stats:   AMC üéû  Shares Outstanding:   % Held By Insiders:   % Held by Institutions:    Shares Short:   Short % of Float:   Short % of Shares Outstanding:    GME    Shares Outstanding:   % Held By Insiders:   % Held by Institutions:   Shares Short:    Short % of Float:   Short % of Shares Outstanding:    BBBY üß¥  Shares Outstanding:   % Held By Insiders:   % Held by Institutions:   Shares Short:   Short % of Float:   Short % of Shares Outstanding:    SPCE    Shares Outstanding:   % Held By Insiders: 40% % Held by Institutions:   Shares Short:    Short % of Float:   Short % of Shares Outstanding:    FUBO üì∫  Shares Outstanding:   % Held By Insiders:   % Held by Institutions:   Shares Short:   Short % of Float:   Short % of Shares Outstanding:    As you can see Gamestop (GME) has the least amount of shares outstanding (by far) of any of these stocks, yet has the second most number of shares shorted behind BBBY which has almost DOUBLE the amount of shares outstanding.   So,  AMC has   of it‚Äôs total shares shorted BBBY has   of its total shares shorted FUBO has   of its total shares shorted SPCE has   of its total shares shorted  But GME has   of it‚Äôs shares shorted!?!?!?!?  Look, I am not a financial advisor and none of this is financial advice, and I may be just a retard, but this retard thinks that everything going on with Gamestop is not just unsusal but downright strange.   Is there any explanation that someone can give me that explains why GME is being shorted SO MUCH, and why it‚Äôs stats are like that?  üèª

Bull Case and Bear Case analysis
I am doing this to lay out some of the facts that I see as the main reason I am still holding.  There is a bull and a bear case in my opinion, seeing that I am still holding I think there is a much stronger bull case though.  Bull Case:  \-Another round of stimmy will give us all a boost  \-Short interest as of 2/2 is growing.     \-We have diamond hands, and we can remain stupid longer than they can remain solvent.  We have millions of people switching to fidelity and vanguard, and new members joining everyday to join the fight.  Even 1 diamond handed retard doing their part helps.  We gained 6 million people in a month.  If even 1 million of them each bought 1 share, and held.  At 100$ a share, that's alot of money and shares.  IDK math.  (100 Million dollars?).  It helps anyway.  This will   up, and just as we had some random paper hands on the way down, they will have paper hands on the way up.  \-We just got a whole bunch more people, at a whole lot cheaper price.  Sure, we have alot of people at 300 and 350, but we have ALOT of people.  Getting all these new people able to reload at 100$ a share is a godsend.  I doubled my shares on the way down, and will probably buy more as money clears.  Diamond hands are the way to go.  IF you are scared, don't want a loss, etc etc. It is literally so simple.  Buy, put in the highest sell order the brokerage will let you, and don't worry about it other than to buy more.  8 MILLION people even with 1000$ each, COULD LITERALLY BUY  GAMESTOP AT ITS CURRENT PRICE.  We already have an edge with people like DFV having .5% of gamestop.  I don't know what his plan is, but if it keeps dropping, and he decides to buy more, or exercise those options, that position will only grow. We have several millionaires in here as well buying and holding.  So, if you have 1-2 shares, they will help make up for it.  Bear Case:  \-Honestly, the only way we lose this is if you sell, or people lose confidence. Have a plan, don't doubt, stick to it, chin up, buy more, live life in the mean time.
Aye. I'll post some porn.

Median Number of GME Shares owned by the average WSB User.
So, we have got A LOT of shit being flung all over here today and surprisingly you apes   have been the least problematic bunch.    We‚Äôre heard all sorts of talk, many but not all being bots:    - ‚ÄúThe shorts have covered, it‚Äôs over‚Äù  - ‚ÄúI cashed out but sadly it was during last weeks premarket at 510 and not 515, you guys are retarded and should sell.‚Äù  - ‚ÄúI burned my house down for the insurance money and put it into GME along with my life savings at $450 and now I‚Äôm long rope.‚Äù  - ‚ÄúI sucked 185 dicks for 185 bucks and got 1 GME share today but then I sold because this is taking too long.‚Äù    So to ease your minds I‚Äôve taken the time to post   on WSB and found the median amount of shares owned by the average WSB user    The data set ranges are a bit wide but for a median it works just fine and may actually be a bit of an underestimation.   So, the number of shares the average WSB user owns?   8.   That may not seem like much but let‚Äôs just check out the number of new WSB users in recent times.  I checked   and saw that on Jan 23rd, we had about   2M   Redditors on WSB, today that number is over   8M  .  Now let‚Äôs be VERY generous and say 30% of the total number of users are actually bots, 10% lurkers, 10% with 0 shares.  Well then that means   4M X 8 Shares = 32M Shares            is in control of over 50% of the available shares.    And let me make it just a bit more interesting...    If those 4M holders theoretically bought 4 more shares each, we would own the available float on GameStop, and we could literally set our price with no room to fuck around. We would effectively own GameStop.      TL;DR: The average WSB user owns 8 shares, some math shows that‚Äôs about 32M shares out of about 47M Float    BUY MORE SHARES, LETS FUCK THE INSTITUTIONS WHO HAVE FUCKED YOU OVER AS LONG AS YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN ALIVE.  Edit: This is not financial advice! I just like the stock. Do whatever the fuck you want. I‚Äôm buying more.  Edit: shoutout to my boy Jbreezerfreezer who did the math because I‚Äôm retarded. Also yes, it‚Äôs far from exact maffs.  Edit: Mandatory - 33 shares at   average  Edit: New math accounting for potential 0 shares.

A message to the old guard
To those whose home has been invaded, I thank you. I am upset, somewhat sullen, and slightly bitter, but still owe you thanks.  I had some prior investment experience. Nothing too serious. I'm a frugal person who saves a lot. I've passively invested--in the most elementary of ways through a few stocks, Roths and IFs--but never took the dive to properly understand the market, its mechanisms, and its movements.  Over the past few weeks, I've gained some insights on these. But I have come to the full realization of just how little I knew. I've attempted to grasp too much too quickly, and had left myself holding a bag. I fell victim to the hype and prospect of gaining a stronger economic footprint amongst a pandemic-driven job market, and have lost about 15% of my net worth. Thankfully, I gambled money that wasn't necessary for bills or debts. Most of my emergency fund is gone, but that will come back soon enough.  What will remain is the cemented, constant caution of DD. The understanding that a core community, whitewashed by popularity, can generate momentum in which they aren't heeded. The reiteration that financial success in these markets is not one of kindness, altruism, or hand-holding.  For all the gaslighting, satire, and lulz, I hate you. But I also understand; you cannot continue to preach the truth when fanaticism dominates the discussion. I've been on the internet long enough to expect nothing less.  Thank you for creating this space. I will take my losses. I will   lurk  ,   listen,   and   learn.    I suggest you     do the same.

Words from an EX SEC official and the fallout of the Great Squeeze of 2021!!!!!!!!!!!
Alright autists,  Gather around the fire place and let me tell you a story I once read upon the great great internet. It was about the Great Squeeze of 2021. In the cold nights of January when hedge funds of dubious morale had their asses handed to them by a bunch of apes with bananas and lust for a stonks. Dirty tricks were played by brokers and other establishments of Wall Street as they waged an ongoing struggle against the common man. This story starts as the struggle seemed lost for our brave apes with bananas.......  Screw it. Read it for yourself. And no I a not the author.     TL;DR  RH could be in more trouble than expected.  SHO list could finally become valuable in SEC investigation. Fuck you Melvin.  WSB unlikely to have broken any manipulation laws.  TX & NY have begun their own investigations.

PSA: the market does not care about your feelings, fairness, or even legality
We have gained so many new people over the past week, I feel like this needs to be said.  GameStop is falling. Whether the hedge funds covering is legal or not doesn‚Äôt matter. If it‚Äôs done illegally, they‚Äôll get a slap on the wrist, a 1-10mil fine, and chalk it up as a net gain vs what they would have lost.  Robinhood and other brokers rigged the game against us, and that‚Äôs it. They might get a slap on the wrist, maybe some will have to remove certain features, but that‚Äôs it.  There won‚Äôt be a great retribution. There probably won‚Äôt be ‚Äújustice‚Äù. Sometimes you just lose money. This is the danger of fomo and looking at the market as a get rich quick scheme. MOST people lose when they do this, only a few win, and usually you have to be in early enough to win anything substantial.  Sometimes being a retard pays off, but most of the time you just lose. There is almost never some some great conspiracy theory. Almost always it‚Äôs just an L.  GameStop ran up over 1000% in a month. It‚Äôs very likely we‚Äôve already experienced the short squeeze.   AMC issued 50million additional shares at the peak which essentially wiped out all short squeeze potential.  There is a ton of money to be made with our collective minds, but spending your energy justifying GameStop is not the way to make that money. If you genuinely think that the short sellers are not currently covering their positions at the prices over the past 2 days then you‚Äôre delusional. Take your emotions out of the market and you‚Äôll make a lot more money.  Godspeed, autists.

How to get gme out of mind
Was up more than 100k .. Now minus 50k. I am broken and on the verge of crying. I also don't think people are diamond hand üß§.. everyone is just screwing around. Sorry guys but I am losing more money than I can lose.. and seriously depressed.  I believe in everything and never sold but they changed the game on Thursday and it has just destroyed the momentum. I will wait for the earning report as I believe things may still be better.. But am just frustrated with myself.. As I always take out principle and this time instead of that added more for the 'cause' at the worst point... Shit  Edit: I have been investing for 5 years or so. Though my picks have been decent but still long term returns in bull market are 20% yoy which imo is as good as a etf. In December due to no job (long story) I found this subreddit and really found it amusing and informative. Got some decent picks and and got into gme in early Jan. (With amount that I could lose)   Initially I had a price target in my mind but then got carried away and instead of making principal free just doubled down which has finally fuckef me so badly (never happened with me).  I just stopped using my brain because as someone said when mia and elon were shilling this, I should have.. but just got fucking carried away  Edit2: I know there will be opportunities but this was one hell of an opportunity and despite getting in on time, I blew it.. sorry guys for spamming

The Wrong Type Of REEEEEEEEE
Listen up, you bukkake fest of screeching mongols. You‚Äôve been thrashing and kicking, like you always do, but in the wrong type of way. What am I talking about?  You set your sights on the BANG stocks and finally found a way to hit Wall Street where it hurts. A win for the retail investor, one might say.  You were suddenly seeing more green in your portfolios than many of you could have ever hoped for and you were hitting the    where it hurts, their pocketbook.   Where you went wrong was taking that small victory and doing full blown retarded things to celebrate. Things like flying banners over robinhood, buying billboards, and just generally taking focus away from your goals and the path to them. You‚Äôve poked the bear and now the bear has swiped back.   Instead of going full retard, which Robert Downey Jr says you should never do, take these moments away from the market to self-improve. Learn to read, research financial topics, evaluate your past plays and the emotions involved, just do more than screeching at the hedge funds for such a small victory. Think about how you, the individual investor, can continue hitting the shorts and start showing the red on their balance sheets again. Always stay retarded but in the way that benefits you at the end of the day.   Not a word of this is financial advice.

Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.  Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:  1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.  2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.  3) Look at    Notice how AMC & GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support. You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading. It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?  4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the "reddit mania" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.  5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?  6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?  7) GME is an outlier in the "failed-to-deliver" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.  8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?  To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.  Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation   + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.  Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.  Position 50 shares GME $210      $GME to the moon        TL;DR   -  YES THERE IS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A SQUEEZE LAST WEEK, BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING LATELY SUGGESTS THIS IS NOT OVER! MOASS IS POSSIBLE UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE! WAIT FOR ACTUAL CONFIRMATION BEFORE THROWING IN THE TOWEL!   edit: by volume I'm simply referring to CNBC's 10 day average volume (96m)
GME 1000 shares for 93,000 ! A few days ago it would have cost me $500,000! What a bargain! NOW is the time to jump on board!
POPEYES HAS US WITH TENDIES!!!
Bought 4 shares at   today, just to be part of this historic moment!
HOG TO THE MOON! HARLEY DAVIDSON MOON INC
Harley Davidson DD- WILD HOGSüêñ üêñ     WHO IS READY TO GO HOG WILD! Harley announced earnings and got spanked- no worries‚Ä¶ we will go the moon.  If intellectually disabled (üêí) look at the TL;DR    BULLISH SENTIMENT:    Jochen Zeitz gives massive hope as a CEO and leader for HOG. The future is EV for the vehicle industry and motorcycles are no different. A niche market for powerful EV bikes has yet to be untapped and is what will push Harley Davidson into the future.  ¬∑ he became CEO of Puma ‚Äì making him the youngest ever CEO of a German company at the time ‚Äì and turned the near-bankrupt business into one of the world's top three sports brands  ¬∑ he now sits on the boards of Harley-Davidson, financial services company Cranemere, and the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as running his own charitable foundation and co-chairing The B Team, a non-profit that he co-founded with Richard Branson in 2012 to promote sustainable business practices.  His previous ventures gave him a strong backing socially and experience with sustainable energy which is a must for Harley Davidson.  Touring and Large cruisers remain to be the biggest driver in profit and production for the company. Even through COVID-19 these remain steady. Introduction of their new bike, Pan-America Adventure Touring Motorcycle, is much more appealing to the younger crowd.    ELECTRIC MOTORCYLES:    Harley-Davidson is striving to be the leader in electric Motorcycles which will quickly set them apart from all other competitors and introduce a new segment of consumers for HOG. The executive staff is fully committed to a distinct product with go-to market strategies.    BEARISH SENTIMENT:    BOOMERS RIDE MOTORCYCLES XD    TL;DR: BUY THE DIP :)
Id rather fucking die than sell!! Buy & hold cunts!
I'm New! But Holding Because Red Looks So Good On Me
Lucid gain overtook my GME losses (still holding) so I could afford these organic tendies
Update: 22k total purchases today added to existing positions. Idk what I'm doing, I just know this ape has  üëè üëè üëè and likes the stonk
Bastard played me. Did he get you too?
possible gay bear play for tendies
Being the autist i am i like the pretty colors of charts and crayons. DIS is set to fall. If chart patterns aren't enough they are reeling financially as well. since the march drop they have more than doubled their share price with an estimated 136% revenue drop from last quarter.  the chart shows 3 price gaps up and a large island formation, a correction is inevitable as the value is overestimated. That pattern and earnings should force this into decline.        I purchased my positions today  DIS Jun 140 P  DIS Jun 100P
I‚Äôm holding my 20 shares of GME because it doesn‚Äôt cost me anything to hold them.
Will continue to hold until $0 or $10k. Keep holding they won't win.
Bot brigade and what it means
Hello tards,  So obviously we're being infiltrated to the max with bots, especially in the daily's. How do you spot a bot? Check to see how long the accounts been active, and how much Karma they've acquired. If they're sitting below 100 karma, they're probably a bot. However, I ran across a few today that had been spamming free karma subs before coming here. Melvs interns are getting smarter apparently.  Why so many bots? What's it all mean? They're scared. They're trying to make you retards panic sell. They want to deprive you of your sweet sweet tendies. If you see a bot, call it out and move on. See you all in the promise land.

Done with Robinhood
Like many others I would imagine, I am done with Robinhood. I wasn't even in GME, but I cannot in good conscious support a company that distorts the free market. Yesterday, when the restriction was 1 GME share, I bought at $246 out of spite. Limit set at $10k if they want it back (so they can't loan out the share). Fuck em.  I have been exiting all my positions yesterday and today and have been transferring the funds to TD Ameritade because I like the Think Or Swim platform.  What platforms are all y'all moving to?
Dip dip dip, buy the dips. Being colorblind let's me see this as green.
GME Losses. Cash came in today, buying them on discount tomorrow
Look at that volume! Y'all are CRUSHING THIS. Keep holding!
GME AMC BB etc aren't the first and won't be the last. If you're new, stick around. This sub has made many great calls and plenty of us have been down big and managed to turn it around and come out ahead. Just find your next move out if you're a believer just hold and wait
The first year of losses is usually considered "tuition" to learn the market. But that doesn't mean you have to lose for a year, just means you should consider any losses a learning lesson. If you're down, either find your next move or diamond hand that shit out.   If you're looking for a new move or additional position, my favorite right now is $ZIXI. There's a good article about it (it's #3 on that list) here:       Summary   TLDR version: Cloud/email/data security. Huge growth, recent acquisition, fair value estimate showing ~50% upside, earnings in 2 weeks at which point the fair value will likely increase even further as the recurring revenues from acquisitions and the continued growth push the data averages higher.     Positions   Call volume for March-May expirys have been spiking, so that's where I'm at. Since the fair value is over $12, I'm buying $11 and $12 strikes.   #ZIXI calls   3/19 $11c      3/19 $12c      5/21 $11c      5/21 $12c    #ZIXI shares Anything under $11 is a bargain
Can we stop cluttering the DD section with stuff that's not DD?
I get many are upset but holy-Bezos-without-a-job have you looked at what has happened to DD? It's all either shitty sob stories or absolutely pointless expectations or "guesses" all about this one random stonk about a gaming store or some shit. It's simple why this happened. The 5 million+ civilized baboons who've entered this sub do not know how we play here.  Not insinuating that I'm intelligent enough to read but just a couple months back, DD used to tell an insightful, nuanced story about why a company would be going uppies or downies. Using imaginary lines on god knows what graphs, like an astrologer doing business. And about more than one stonk. That's the kind of shit we need to bring back.  So to those who feel inclined to tag your clearly non-DD post as DD, may I direct you to the "Discussion" tag?

No, E TRADE, you cannot borrow my stocks. Not now, not ever. They‚Äôre non.
Received an email from E TRADE notifying me that I can make money loaning out my stonks. (40 GME, 50 BB among them.) I assume they want to loan them out to cover shorts. Anyone else get something like this?  ‚ÄúWe want to let you know that you‚Äôre eligible to apply to the E TRADE Fully Paid Lending Program.¬π With just a few clicks, you could be earning an additional $1,468 annually by lending out any hard-to-borrow (HTB) stocks you may own now or in the future. ‚Äù  That would be like letting some asshole borrow your   right?       to the   ,   üí™,
CRSR DD that you've been waiting for. Why this stock will moon and break the upper most layer of the earth known as Lithosphere.
First things first, I am not Melvin Capital and I am not trying to distract you from GME squeeze. I am just a retard on this sub who's seen lots of quality DD's and would like to summarize all of it into one solid long DD.   Before I get started with the DD, I wanna make put it out there that   "THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE NOR I AM SAYING YOU SHOULD BUY THIS STOCK, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH YOU DINGUS"        Corsair IPO'ed in September at $  and the stock went rocket rocket straight upto 30$+. The all time highs has been 50$ ish and is currently trading at 38$. They absolutely destroyed Q3 earnings and beat expectations in every department.        Here's some of the highlights of their Q3 earnings, Source :- globenewswire & their Q3 report.    Net revenue was $  million, an increase of   year-over-year. Segment net revenue was $  million, an increase of   year-over-year. Gaming components and systems segment net revenue was $  million, an increase of   year-over-year.  Gross profit was $  million, an increase of   year-over-year, with gross margin of  , an improvement of 680 basis points year-over-year.  Operating income was $  million, an increase of   year-over-year.  Adjusted operating income was $  million, an increase of   year-over-year.  Net income was $  million, or $  per diluted share, compared to net income of $  million in the same period a year ago, or $  per diluted share.  Adjusted net income was $  million, or $  per diluted share, an increase of   year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $  million, or $  per diluted share.  Adjusted EBITDA was $  million, an increase of   year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of  , an improvement of 610 basis points year-over-year.  As of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $  million, $  million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $  million.       SNAPSHOT of their Financials                      The stock ran from 21$ to 40$ after their Q3 earnings report so there should be no brainer that stock won't do the same again.   Like I already mentioned, that anything discussed on this DD is not an advice and its a personal opinion.    $CRSR had a non-dilutive offering last week at $35 per share. This didn't add shares, just gave their initial PE firm a chance to cash out. With 7M shares sold at $35, this built a solid new "floor" for the stock on high volume at $35. Corsair has 36% short interest (obviously lower than GME), but the main IPO lock up period doesn't expire til March. Corsair's current available float is only 20% of total shares outstanding while short interest is 36%. Not a lot of shares available for shorts to cover if the stock starts moving against them.     The Market Cap for this stock is \  B and their Revenue for Q4 is half of that? Insane. I'm likely expecting it to be way over the estimations above just like when they doubled expectations the quarter before. The floor for this is 35$ as shown by the past month and a half and It peaked at 51$.  u/thechosenguy1 said "These numbers aren't going to drop either after COVID. When you invest this much money into a gaming setup for you or your child or whatever. They will keep putting money in. When their mouse breaks from smashing it after losing an online game like the baby they are. Or perhaps after they spill their Mountain Dew all over their mousepad? A lot of things that this pandemic has made us accustomed to are here to stay."                 TLDR : I am holding 40$c's expiring 2/19. THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE . DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.         Thanks to these users for posting the DD's. I have used some of their information into my DD.    u/Florida_Knight77  u/BarmeIo-Xanthony  u/thechosenguy1
I inadvertently was doing the double your money roulette strategy (GME Loss)
Is this short data reliable?
Just cut this from MW. I like this stock, and on the ride regardless. Just wondering if it's correct data.     Can someone tell me if this short data is as of today, like the rest of the numbers? The bottom left seems to me to justify holding no matter waht and buy up whatever we can still afford. Somebody set a retard straight so I can cry in my beer if needed. Otherwise, I'm on to the moon with the apes.
You guys went from bragging about making mountains of cash to bragging about losing it all, but that holding is the noble cause and it will surely go up again. Come on lol.....
In the spirit of these holds being a "bet" - this is the actual definition of sunk cost fallacy. The market moved on already - smart people are already cashing out.    DFV isn't smart for leaving 30 million fucking dollars on the table by having "diamond hands", he's a goddamn idiot who valued a little bit of karma more than millions of dollars he could have closed with. And now I'm sure he's hoping it doesn't slide another few million tomorrow, but it likely will.    It's going to take weeks/months for another GME-styled rally to occur, if it's even possible to replicate now.    Put your bets in on other stocks, or stick with GME, but stop being so goddamn delusional about it.
How I justified buying more, they were just giving it away today!

Meme stock post-mortem
Throwing out some lessons-learned for everyone (especially the   million people who joined in the past two weeks).  Here's why shit went sideways for you:    You didn't do your research:   GME (and to a lesser extent NOK/BBBY/BB) has been a work-in-progress for months.  This wasn't something organic and spontaneous; there was a very small window to catch the lightning.  Once in, you took the advice from random internet strangers who want you to buy/hold to increase the value of their positions.    You FOMO'd:   If you knew about this before $100 and didn't jump, you probably should've sat it out.  If you found out about this after $100, you should have watched from the sidelines and taken notes for the next time.    You didn't have a plan:   Sure, your spaceship emojis are cute but they're free and you can't buy anything with them in the real world.  If you're buying stocks, you're doing so with the intent to make money.  Money is only real when you sell.  Set a goal, stick to it (or make small adjustments; it's ok to change a goal as long as it's REASONABLE).  This includes taking profits and then, if you want, buying back in on a dip.    You made it personal:   Stocks aren't your pets; they're fucking cattle.  Get what you can out of them and then move on.  You don't buy stocks to join a feel-good movement about sticking it to the <insert target group here> or because "I like to company/stock", you buy them to make money.     You made it a group activity:   Unless you're pooling resources and winnings, all these "Ape" comments are fucking retarded.  That's code for, "please don't leave me I don't want to be the last one holding bags"    You missed the obvious signs:   WSB goes dark and all the meme stocks collapse a the same time, that's a sign.  All of the meme stocks move in-sync, that's a sign (algos are in charge, not retail investors).    You used money you couldn't lose:   This ties into the group mentality and DD where you just hopped on the bus without asking where it was going or how; NEVER spend money you can't afford to lose in the stock market -- there are no sure bets.  100% this will get removed by all the fucking idiots in this sub so do yourself a solid and copy/paste it for reference; hopefully it'll add value to your future endeavors.  If you made money in all of this, congrats; don't forget to put some aside for taxes.
Why I am Not Selling my GME, Reverse FOMO
What is Different about, The Big Squeeze.    I'm always willing to lose the money when Trading, thats the common denominator. But look at the upside. If this popped and I sold?   God damn, thats what I cant afford to lose  . I would never forgive myself.  I can pass up other trades, but TBH   reverse FOMO   in a big way. There is no way in HELL I am missing out on this.  What other trade can you be apart of with these stakes? Even if we lose the money, IT WILL BE THE BEST MONEY I EVER LOST.    Why it is different.    I remember a bunch of us on this sub saw the Coronavirus dip coming, It was called the beer virus and yeah, its never popular to be a   ... Guess what? We made a lot of money. Guess who I told.... NO ONE.  We saw one of the most impactful tsunamis to hit the financial system, It wasn't cool to be right. It wasn't another BIG SHORT.  You will have a lifetime to make and lose money in the market, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I support it win or loose.      Position: 26 shares. Contracts expired worthless Friday cause "VLAD the STOCK IMPALER\ "\   TLDR: There is no way in hell I am missing out on this. If we're wrong, we loose money. If were right we   make history   (Even more than it already has)  \ Not investment advice, my opinion\  \ Only invest what you can afford to lose\
My dad is trying to teach an ape how to invest. Let‚Äôs work on getting these tattoos he promised

WARNING FOR ALL THOSE LOOKING TO JUMP FROM RH TO FIDELITY   READ THIS BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR MOVE
Hi there fellow autists. After the bullshit that Robinhood pulled last week I, and many others on this sub, decided to jump ship for another brokerage. I read the fine print as I hope at least some of you did. I understood my stocks would be in limbo and I would be shit out of luck for about a week. What I did not know was that Robinhood's "instant deposit" or w/e they call it basically turns your account into a margin account. So when my stocks made it over to Fidelity everything showed up as being on margin. There was a sweet $2k deficit on there as well. That deficit was the result of an unsettled deposit to RH from a few days prior to my initiating the account transfer. Just fucking wonderful. After being on the line for over two hours with Fidelity's customer service to find out what the actual fuck is happening with my stocks they explained that because there was a deficit and the stocks were on margin they would be rejecting the transfer and sending everything back over to Robinhood.  So what's the takeaway here? Make fucking sure any deposits, purchases or otherwise are SETTLED before transferring over your account. Else you will be in the same boat and stuck back at Robinhood.  Be safe out there retards.  none of this is financial advice, I am a retard and anything I say here is purely for entertainment purposes only.
They can‚Äôt phase me. I‚Äôm an ex recovering gambling addict. Bust or to the moon. I ain‚Äôt selling.

FROM 5 SHARES TO 50 TODAY! LETS DO THIS!
Dip tastes so good I had to go in for one more chip
Squeeze please
I‚Äôm very pissed. But I bought 20 more shares today. I‚Äôm not fucking. Selling ... period. If we‚Äôre wrong we‚Äôre wrong, I feel like Jordan Belford and mark cuban are tryna signal us to stay strong cuz doomsday is near. And it‚Äôs bigger than we think it is. THEY NOT GONNA GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT
I have $62 that I can't transfer out of RH yet, so here is what I'm going to do with it
I'm doing my part. 10 shares at $32, bought 2 more today at a nice discounted $90. If this works it'll be historic, if not GME is still an undervalued company and its a great long term hold.
Why the fuck are we acting like we lost? We made GME go from 4 to 400 and it took combined trading platforms to silence and cheat to bring it to 90.
Did everyone forget what happened in Thursday? That was a calculated effort to bring down our position. FUCK OFF BILLIONAIRS, well still take you fucking money; who do you think will fund our food s ?  We didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlose‚Äù because we made a bad call, we ‚Äúlost‚Äù because we made the RIGHT call and this disturbed  some folks at the top.   I was reading 2 articles in Wall Street journal and it made my blood boil- first article was saying ‚Äúrandom penny stock went up 30% with no news or announcement‚Äù- the people that are paid to predict and report and are the expert at stock market are saying this shit. The second article right after made me want to fuck the writers wife: ‚ÄúGME and AMC, Reddit favorite stocks, plunged after apparent loss in interest from retail investors‚Äù LOSS IN  INTEREST? MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN ONLY BUY 5 FUCKING SHARES EACH.   WE LIKE THE STOCK. THOSE FUCKS JUST DON‚ÄôT LET US BUY IT. How is GameStop and AMC and BB not already suing robinhood? Is any stock expert really gonna act like had they not restricted in Thursday, it would have went down that much?   What the fuck is this gaslighting? That last week didn‚Äôt happen? Why are every news channel acting like they called GME or BB or AMC falling like it happened organically and not deliberately by everyone involved?   Is GME worth 400$? FUCK NO. But since when was the stock market about actual worth? Stocks have become fiat currency in themself, doesn‚Äôt matter than company quarterly earnings, or its news, if people buy it, it goes up. When you restrict that- it goes down.   We were up against billions of fund, trading platforms that we do not own or have a say in, our weapons, controlled by the enemy. Those fucks in TV acting like they actually called GME falling like this or acting like this is perfectly normal are trying to gaslight us about what happened in Thursday.   FUCK THEM. We still got GME to go up and caused international fevor- we made the right call, we had the right stock, we had the right people, our enemies just had control of the only weapon we could use.

GME LOSS PORN UPDATE NEVER SELL
"Journal" AMC GME margin shares to cash account. It's awesome!   ü§≤
I'm seeing a lot of people talk about using margin for AMC GME etc. That basically help shorts allowing them to use shares from margin accounts Why not just  buy in a cash account and let your broker know not to lend your shares?   If you did buy shares on margin, and don't have margin debt( meaning its covered by your cash in the account and not on debt), then you can Journal( basically means transfer) your margin shares into your cash account. So now, you then have shares backed by cash, and not in margin thus taking away shares shorts can use. Remember only works on shares that don't make a margin debt in your account. I journaled some shares by calling fidelity. It worked instantly and no fees.    ü§≤

Data-Driven DD: I analyzed 265,000 rows of SEC Short Fails-to-Deliver data so you don't have to! (Extremely important data for Counterfeit Stock theories)
# The GME SEC Data and Hedge Fund Shitfuckery: A Deep Dive  As I'm sure many of you who have been following the "Counterfeit Shares" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read   which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.    TLDR of Johnny's post:   Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the "counterfeit" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.       The Data:    I noticed that while    IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS       Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:    First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding "counterfeit share" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:     As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more "counterfeit shares" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.     If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\ (# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):     GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either ‚Äî if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.       Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:    Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by  .     Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of "counterfeit stock" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure ‚Äî when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.  Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that  , and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.  A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:          Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:    So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\  or could be indicative of something more.   \ Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream ‚Äî GME in December was not an "unprecedented situation" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.        A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:    I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \ , detailing both the "surface level" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:     As you can see, the Counterfeiting   authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been "laundered," through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting   paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.  If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting   are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as   noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.  These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.  So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting   were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.  I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.     Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.     I am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.     # TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

Explaining current situation for Ape
Explaining short ladders with banana.  Apes in jungle. 2 snake come up and say "We have banana!" (All ape know that banana worth $100).  Then the 2 snake hide in tall grass where no Ape can participate (aka the current GME/restricted broker situation) and snake says to other, "I'll sssell this to you for $50." And snake gives him $50. And then second snake says "I'll sssell this to you for $10" and first snake buys it back for $10.  Snake then leave tall grass and say loudly, "Banana only worth $10 now, you sssaw us buy and sssell it for $10. It could go down to $3 sssoon! We will pay $10 for all your banana!"  Ape now have to think. Is this fair price for banana? Or are snakes being snakes and banana still $100? Ape thinks banana still worth $100. Ape will buy whole tree instead of sell his banana.  ü¶ß is not financial advice. Own bananas responsibly.
Here‚Äôs my humble loss never selling
I took a look at the stocks i bought yesterday, and if i had two brain cells to rub together i would be panic selling. I will be purchasing more tomorrow!!!
Today was a tough one ! At least we had a flash sale !

Honoured to have lurked amongst this growing mega city of what WallStreet should look like one day as a true free market.
Admit it. Most of you are fighting with yourselfs about the authenticity of this whole event.   I agree with Mark in saying its completely possible to regroup and push again but that would mean hopefully some people got out with good profit and are willing to put that back into the market. Hope some of you little fries got out with the cash.   There were an incredible amount of complete bullshit talkers and disruptors during this and it's been incredibly easy for HF to take back control by infiltrating the group and using the media.   Smart money around here now watching every tiny detail and throwing thier own spanners in the mix and I'm not just talking about silver.   The amount of degenerates gained on the sub is an absolutely phenomenal achievement and I'm incredibly glad to have lived through this and watched it all unfold from the COVID crash.   God speed to most of you.

GME Simplified: Supply vs. Demand
I love how Cuban put it- the reason GME is down is because there is not enough demand (mostly due to RH restricting). In the past week, the enemy has done a mighty good job of making this stock look less appealing. We need to counter it by making people want this stock. We can't just like it. We must LOVE it and make OTHERS LOVE it. We need to remind everyone of the mission and what's at stake. Even if it doesn't squeeze, if we just keep buying the stock, it will go up. And nothing will bring on the squeeze more than the price going up.    TLDR  : We can't just hold, we must buy!  Oh, and this is not financial advice. I love the stock.
I know it's not much, but I put my entire 401k into GME today. I've officially got diamond hands, boys. Stonks go up. To the moon.      monkey no give financial advice
Too poor for GME, still holding onto BB though, pretty sure there won't be a squeeze but I'm hoping for a correction soon
Might be down a little over 1k but don‚Äôt worry because I bought the dip!    Have calls in $BB and some shares in GME so I can‚Äôt wait to go to the moon!!

Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos to Step Down as CEO
Got ready for work, turned on my car, hit spotify and this song pops up.. Coincidence?
Today was another test, and I believed most passed, some failed but we won't mention any   PaperHands). As the title states I was getting ready to go to work and the song that comes on was Headstrong by Trapt. What a throw back but not only was this song nostalgic, it had great meaning with what us retards are dealing with right now. At this very instance.  As we dissect this chorus:  I see your motives inside - We see you hedge fucks and we know your tactics   Decisions to hide - Yeah you better be trying to hide/falsify your short %  Back off I'll take you on   Headstrong to take on anyone   I know that you are wrong   Headstrong we're Headstrong   Back off I'll take you on   Headstrong to take on anyone   I know that you are wrong   This is not where you belong: Basically meaning we're unified and strong together, apes are united for one cause and we know these hedge fucks fucked up big time, and now we call the shots not them.  I can't give everything away - Diamond Fucking Hands, Hold The God Damn Line!   I won't give everything away - We won't paper hand this bitch. Watching this go to the MOON or holding this shit FOREVER!  Anyone else take meaning in their everyday life and spin it into someone that works for them? Well anyways I'm excited for the rest of this week. LETS GOOO!!!
I don't think the squoze is coming and my hands are getting weak - public apology
I'm sorry boys, time has come for me to accept defeat. I am bowing down and laying down my weapons in front of these hedgies. I am sorry to my king u/DeepFuckingValue but I don't have diamond hands like you do    I bought 17 shares @ 388 and I will be selling 10 of them at market open tomorrow.  Rest 7 shares I will hold for sentimental value until they all go down to $0 idc I'm never selling those. I will ask my broker to give me a certificate for it which I will frame and hang it on my wall over my bed.  Good luck to everyone else who is holding. If all you guys end up going to the moon or Pluto     I will watch you with tears in my eyes from this tiny earth.  Fly you fools but I can't hold on üò¢
Still holding GME. This isn‚Äôt over like how the media is spinning it.
BIGGEST REDISTRIBUTION OF ALL TIME
You bought at 400$ and now you‚Äôre considering selling for a big loss and forgetting about all this thing once and for all ?  Before you sell, please read this:  We all know that not only the price was manipulated down. Also we had some paper-handed üìÑ ü§öpussys üê± selling their 3,62 shares for a big lossüìâ.  If the price stays at this levels for at least one more day (or better stays falling) the diamond handed   ü§ö chads are going to soak up more and more shares, that once belonged to paper-hands.  This means that these shares become SAFE üîí ü§ö!  If you are still uncertain please go and jack off 3 times, read the AMA of  , read a few DD's (the OG ones) and look at DFV's balance.  If all this does not help I beg you to please sell for a big loss, so we can buy your shares for a massive discount.

Question from someone new around here
Hey all,  I started coming around in the past few days - the hype got me.    I don't know much about the stonks, but I got me a couple of shares of $GME and $AMC so I could ride along.   Been doing some research and I'm a little confused about something that I hope someone might be able to help me clear up.  Now I'm no mathematician but how could the percent of float and of the quantity held by institutions be above 100%?  Is this just something that happens, or is it effectively proof that sketchy shit is going on?
The events we are living are the first of a huge revolution which will reshape companies and the whole economy
For thousands of years product prices have been based on the demand, merchants sold carpets for a fixed price and citizens just bought those carpets at that price, no matter if they thought the price was too high for those carpets.  There have been a point in the market history in which citizens finally realized that prices were based on their own demand, they realized they could indirectly choose the price themselves by talking each other to let everyone acknowledge of the existence of other merchants who sold the same carpets at a lower price. They understood that they were in control of the market and if they thought something was undervalued or overvalued they just behaved accordingly.  That shaped the economy and the market forever. It all happened because every single individual received somehow a very basic knowledge of economy.  These days a new market and economy revolution is starting. Most of us finally acknowledged some more notions of market economy, we now know some more, even if still just a few, of the inner workings of the stock market. Most of us didn't even know that market makers exist, and how to blame them? Try to search for "Who decides the price of a stock?" on the internet, you'll find hundreds of articles that tell you what a stock price is based on, but unless you know the term "market makers" you will have to search for hours in order to find who actually shows you those prices.  So, hey, some people in the future will study these events, and you are part of them right now!

Where did you move your GME gains to?
So, I know a lot of this sub is still ‚Äúin battle‚Äù but, for those that took profits already- where are you investing your profits?  I ended up more than doubling my account, took the gains and parked them between ARKF, ARKG, ARKK, ARKQ, and CSXE. Been going nice these past couple days. Though, I‚Äôll definitely miss those +100% days lol.   But yeah, after the stress GME took on me, I‚Äôm ready to sit in ETFs for a little and do some boomer passive investing.

Also, if you have a margin account, your brokerage can loan your shares out without notifying you. Convert to cash, or buy GME in cash account.

New stimulus checks may be the fuel to send GME higher again
Unlike prior rounds where stimulus checks were spread around amongst many big tech stocks, this go around stimulus checks may go straight into GME and that concerted buying effort may be the catalyst that sends GME much higher now that new short positions may have been re-established in the $200-$400 range.  For the record, I do not have a position (yet) and would never entertain buying GME under normal conditions because the fundamentals are not there, but I will be watching closely what the stimulus package will look like and how big ‚Äî if they tighten the brackets of who receives checks or not...

CALLaway Part 10 - The Finale
Welcome my back my can't-look-you-in-the-eyes brethren. I was so inspired by the little grass roots movement over my absence, I decided to come back and give some more thoughts on our one and only   CALLaway ($ELY)  , which has earnings coming up after-hours on Monday.  As is tradition,   we are talking about a $  billion market cap company that has $  billion revenues of their own and just bought Topgolf, which has revenues of $  billion and growing at ridiculous levels!       My positions include stock and 2/19 $30c as pictured:        I want to focus around two things in this post: 1. recent upgrades and their reasoning, and   2. VOLUME  .  First, let's look at the the upgrades in the last month.   Jefferies upgraded $ELY's price target from $30 to $40 with upside of $50  ; Stephens upgraded their price target from $25 to $32; and today B. Riley upgraded from $30 to $33. I am in possession of the analyst briefs from Jefferies and Stephens that are ultra-bullish. Although I cannot redistribute the briefs,   please watch       from Jeffries   to get an idea.       Second, we need to talk about volume. Since I left, the volume has started to fade a little likely because MMs see this as a prime stock to short because of the low volume.   Let's show them who the fuck is boss and buy up the shares to make this thing fly  . Even if we can't come in and bump the volume up, there are two catalysts that surely will: 1. earnings on February 8, 2021, and 2. the special stockholder meeting on March 3, 2021 that was disclosed in this  .        Let's keep our little grassroots movement moving! If you have any questions look through my previous posts linked below or send me a message. I appreciate all of you so damn much for following me, and   if we hit $35 by February 18, 2021, I will donate $5,000 to Autism Speaks.

GME and AMC comparison chart - IDENTICAL! WHY?

Important things I learned while transferring my entire account from Robbinhood to Fidelity.
First and foremost fuck Robbinhood. Okay, now that that is out of the way, here are some tips I learned (the hard way) while transferring my accounts.  1. I think this is the most important one: if you are regularly placing trades, those funds are technically not settled. While Robbinhood does not really point this out clearly it is something that is imperative to be aware of.   I placed multiple trades on the two days before I transferred accounts (didn‚Äôt place any after, obviously) and those trades apparently were not settled on Robbinhood at the time my transfer was initiated. What Robbinhood does in this situation is liquidate those shares (for example,  40 shares of CRSR were bought at $  a couple days ago and those were liquidated at the time of the transfer... it‚Äôs now at $  and I‚Äôm missing all those gains because those new shares were liquidated)  2. If you‚Äôre using margin on Robbinhood, you can transfer those securities too BUT make sure you have applied and been approved for margin on your Fidelity account before starting the transfer. Before all this madness this usually took 1-3 days to be approved, but it‚Äôs taking much longer on Fidelity‚Äôs end because of all of the traffic.  3. If you transfer your entire account out of Robbinhood they pretty much become a salty bitch and deactivate everything. They‚Äôre also saying that my margin is now negative cash and that I need to deposit money or sell, even though neither of those are possible since my account is deactivated... Fidelity has said to just wait it out until the transfer is complete (about 5-6 business days).  4. There is also about $3,300 of securities that are not showing up in the transfer... no biggie.

Regretted being a paper handed little bitch before, thank you shorts for giving me the opportunity to go back in! I really like the stock!
Super sophisticated DUE DILIGENCE!
The thing is, some idiots might think this is over. But if the price just goes back to $400, regardless of when, maybe fucking 5 years into the future, then all those paper handed bitches who sold at $100 will FOMO back in and BOOM, the short squeeze will begin and the stock price will shoot up to $5000.  But guys, that doesn't mean anything. If WSB can buy all of fucking Gamestop, we can literally buy control of it... We can literally turn it around to become a trillion-dollar company. Tell me that's not genius.     EDIT: I'M EUROPEAN SO LIKE I HAVE NO FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY OR WHATEVER SO LIKE IM JUST UNEDUCATED AND YES THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVICE!!

GME in a nutshell
Don't paper hand GME due to boomer bots. Real sentiment data!
All right retards, we are seeing a lot of bots spreading shit about GME and pushing some other stocks.  I track market sentiment about various stocks using NLP on data from both Reddit and Twitter. After analyzing more than a million comments and tweets the live and long-term sentiment for GME is very positive. Don't be swayed by the bots pushing negative narrative.                  Obviously, this isn't financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyway. Stay safe, and remember the golden rule:

This very low dip is where we show the HF who is boss and where strength in numbers are.  If you sold yesterday or today.. you are paper hands.. if you are trying to get back in because you see the squeeze about to happen. Then welcome back.. but you need to hold just like every else is doing. Don't flake on us again.  We can make this squeeze like everyone wanted to. Just stay the course and buy. Buy small amounts through the day and hold. Do not sell.  Put your money where your mouth is.  This is not financial advice.

Probability of Ryan Cohen buying 7% of GME
Important to read if you‚Äôre holding GME                 Okay so I personally think that that GME is going to trade relatively sideways until we see another catalyst. The new technology executive announcement is definitely very positive, but doesn‚Äôt have the same spark as an Elon tweet.  I think, as many of my fellow bag holders are all hoping, that Ryan Cohen exercising his right to purchase 7% of GME will provide the spark we need to get back on track to the 400/500 and beyond range.  So, Ryan‚Äôs a smart guy. I think he recognizes where this company can go and the massive gaming and e sports industry that is only on the rise - it‚Äôs obvious there is strong pricing support at the $90 range.  If $90 is the new floor, which I believe it is, and Ryan Cohen may as well, what is the probability of him exercising this right?   I‚Äôd say we have a 50/50 chance that he announces the purchase of these shares this week. I think GameStop is going to piggyback off of their latest executive hire announcement into this, and fully come out as a online/e-commerce transitioning company.  I think that their competitor, EA sports, is going to  this need with their latest results . As Dow Jones newswire says today:  ‚ÄúThe game publishing giant reported late Tuesday a 19% jump in net bookings for the December quarter, driven by digital sales and its live services. The company noted that 62% of its new game sales for the quarter were digital, compared to 49% in last year's holiday period.   Digital game sales create two problems for GameStop. One, they generally don't move through GameStop stores, with the exception of those driven by cards that the retailer sells. ‚Äú  TLDR: 50% chance that GME has been quietly lurking and just waiting for the right time to announce with Ryan Cohen. They wanted to wait for all you paper handed b tches to bounce.                         Sincerely, 120 GME @avg 64

Why I am not selling
First off this is probably going to be kinda long as I'm stuck at home while my girlfriend is out with her husband. And I've got nothing to do while my game is updating .   I saw alot of people posting why they were behind the "movement" last week. Saying "Wall Street took everything from us" ect ect yada yada so I wanted to give my two pence at this low point.  I was ten when the 2008 wall street crash happened I remember watching it on the TV with my dad. And he was stressing out about a overdue bill letter stack about the size of my prepubescent head, all I remember thinks is how can this effect us in a little village in the North of England. And those people all looked so happy on the balcony what's the big deal?  Well skip forward a year and my dad took off and left the house a tip smashed windows, TV everything and left my mum with a big pile of det. She struggled to pay of. While raising three kids but we got by. When I was fourteen I got a job and I've been working ever since I passed up on collage and university for work and I'm only just starting to realise what a big mistake that was and get my degree.  A few years ago when I was nineteen I walked happily in to the arms of a forex guru that promised me I would get rich quick and be able to quit my job and make loads of money. That ended up as I'm sure I have no need to tell this sub with me back on my mums sofa not a pence to my name actually about three grand down. Crying in to my hands and thinking my life was over. I went on a dmp (det management plan for all you newbie degens out there) the woman on the phone asked all my income my out goings ect ect, then told me calmly that it would take me 3 years to pay off 3 grand!  I hung up the phone changed my job became a utter wage slave working 60 - 70 hours a week to get back on my feet. Nine months later I was( and then sum)  It wasn't easy but I got through it.   This time when I heard about gme two weeks ago on reddit at 2 in the the morning. I understood it wasn't a get rich scheme it was just a good stock pick. I did my own dd (as I advise you retards do) and decided to put a small portion of my savings in to it. I was lucky I've been in since 38 I've seen more money then I've ever had in my life on my screen in the past week and I've seen it go. But I don't believe this is over not by a long shot. Because you can't get rich quick that's not how this thing works.   Now please look after your mental health. Don't invest more then you can afford to lose. Don't check your screen every two seconds creaming your pants if it goes up or shitting them if to goes down. Drink water and buy gme    Tl;Dr ,    =      (not financial advise just passing time while I'm letting my girlfriends husband have a go for once)

Bull Case for AMC - DD from a Hollywood Film Producer-Director
\ Not Financial Advice. Entertainment purposes only.    I work in the film & tv industry in Hollywood. I was bearish on AMC for 2021 because of the pandemic. Our industry pretty much shut down and our local productions, while still going on, are pricey due to the many restrictions and guidelines set forth by our state.   But recent events with GME made me take a deep dive into the numbers, and well, AMC actually looks pretty good. I nearly forgot that studios like Paramount, Universal, Disney, etc. are bagholding their slate of tentpole movies (movies with budgets well over 200-million) because it doesn't make any sense to stream them.    Quick Facts:     1) AMC received a fresh infusion of cash through the stonks.    2) And this was after AMC received loans in the north of 100-million.     And here's the banger:     3) AMC has 2-years worth of tentpole movies from all the major studios waiting for release. This includes Tenet (projected  , Mulan, Wonder Woman, Top Gun 2, Fast and the Furious, Bond, Pixar's Soul, Space Jam and many many more.  A typical year might have three of these.   This is bad for the studies because their "great" movies now have to compete for market share in a saturated market, but for AMC, it's a great problem to have. It's like having 2 Christmas's in one day.     Pent-Up Demand:     Box office ticket sales, pre-pandemic, have been around 10-11-billion dollars per year. AMC has the dominant market share and had been generating about 5 to   in revenue (from ticket sales and concessions).   When Japan re-opened their theaters, Demon Slayer became the number one grossing movie of all time. Pundits believed that the Japanese would've probably watched anything that was released at that point due to pent-up demand.   If the pent-up demand hypothesis is true, then late 2021 might have the biggest, most profitable quarter ever for AMC, and 2022 will be even bigger. Forward guidance reported in any 2021 quarter's earnings will foster great optimism, and due to secular factors and the fed's push for lower interest rates, we might see some of the best numbers     Another possibility:     If Japan cancels the Olympics (likely), that opens up another 2-3-month window of time for studios to schedule their releases. For example, instead of Wonder Woman competing for August's 1-billion market share with Pixar's Soul, Soul could release in August, and Wonder Woman could release in October, etc. This means more efficient releases and more dinero for AMC.   TL;DR - Pent-up demand, likely near-term re-opening due to vaccines, the fact that major film studios are bag-holding tentpole movies and will do whatever it takes to release them to the market when AMC still has the lead market share of theatrical ticket sales makes me MEGA bullish on AMC.
I saw this on my way to the store
VIX, UVXY, VXX
First, click this link and read it:     Now the first thing you might be asking if you have half a wrinkle in your brain is: Aren't VIX products derived from a formula? You can't possibly affect VXX or UVXY just by buying into it right?  Wrong. Basically what the article suggests is: Money goes into VIX products (VXX, UVXY), thus money does not go into regular stocks. This reduces liquidity, increasing volatility. Then people eye these flows, make decisions based on big inflows into volatility products, and those choices (read: buying puts) lead to more increased volatility. This feeds itself repeatedly until it all blows up like another Feb 2018 Volmageddon/Volpocalypse.  Then you might wonder: Isn't volatility mean-reverting? Yes. But who gives a shit? Half of you are paper hands anyways. Take the first easy spike and sell your UVXY/VXX when VIX hits 50 then.  This is not financial advice. I was conceived by monkeys and I drink bleach twice daily as needed for sleep. Also I watch anime and virtual youtubers.  Position: 63,200 UVXY Shares.

Drive Shack is incredibly undervalued at the moment.
Drive Shack is a leading owner and operator of golf-related leisure and entertainment businesses. Last week they announced a public offering of 20,833,334 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $  per share (which I believed has been closed as of yesterday). At the moment, it is selling at $  a share.  If you look at its stock price chart, you'll see that from 2013 to 2020 that it was relatively stable and was averaging $4 a share. Of course the pandemic happened, and this caused the price to plummet. Now that the pandemic is nearing its end, I believe that we will see its stock price increase back to its $4 dollar mark in the very near future: especially since the average age of a golfer in the US is 54, and they are more likely to receive the vaccine sooner than your average American.  By the way, last week Drive Shack announced a collaboriation with Rory McIlroy and its new indoor entertainment golf experience: this caused the price to increase to increase to $  last week. It was after this that they announced the public offering at $  a share. Honestly, this stock seems like it is very undervalued at the moment.                          --  Disclaimer: I am new to commenting on reddit, though I've had this reddit account for a while.  Thus I decided to increase my karma in a very cheap fashion (as others have pointed out) in order to share my thoughts with you on Drive Shack.  Obviously this wasn't the best idea I've ever had, however I think it's best that you are informed of what I did.  My apologies; I'll try to be a better contributor in the future.                          --  Positions: I own 8,356 shares of Drive Shack.

Feeling bullish on $CNC, Healthcare dip due to covid results, ACA SEP on the 15th
Not nearly enough DD, but from what I am seeing,   $CNC is one of the largest ACA and public health player and also is the first major public health on the ER Calendar for next Tuesday. Beta is   and marketwatch low target is 16% higher that todays price.  The dip this month is being attributed to Q4 covid utilization and unfavorable vaccine distribution, but:   (1) here is going to be an ACA SEP from feb15 through early summer  (2) Biden admin increased subsidies on silver ACA plans to the point where many members are going to have zero premiums which should not only increase enrollment during the SEP but also decrease attrition rates throughout the year  (3) Economic downturns boost medicaid enrollment  thoughts?

A Repost of my DD on SAVA from 1/19
I originally posted this DD which was taken down due to <1B market cap. We're now at   and in order to get the good word out I'm reposting this. Hopefully it won't get taken down this time!   REMEMBER THE CONTEXT: THIS WAS POSTED BEFORE ALL THIS GME HEDGEFUND FUCKERY   before you accuse me of shilling for another pump and dump (hard to say how much of this current price move is a pump, but i'm hodling so...).  Current position:  2410 SAVA  15 SAVA $15c 2/19, 4 SAVA $15c 3/19, 14 SAVA LEAPS   And Here We Go:   # Tired of all the GME (   ) deepthroating recently?  (obligatory fuck you Melvin, fuck you Shittron)  Here's my DD on Cassava Sciences, a biopharmaceutical company developing Sumifilam, a new Alzheimers drug.    TLDR: CASSAVA Sciences got 68% of its operating costs paid in grants by the NIH in order to fund a groundbreaking Alzheimer's drug that's about to get fast-tracked to market to treat all of our dementia-riddled grandparents. SAVA gets a $286 price target assuming phase 3 success and my autistic math says that gives a $186 current fair value.    A few days ago, this article got published on Seeking Alpha:  >  4 Reasons Cassava Sciences Could Be The Best-Performing Stock Of 2021    There‚Äôs a lot of good info in this that we don‚Äôt have time to get into but I‚Äôll focus in on one key point the author makes:  >  Simufilam is a Shoo-In for Breakthrough Therapy Designation    Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) means it will be accelerated through phase 3 trials to market  40% faster  than non breakthrough drugs.  If Simufilam gets BTD, this is what will happen to the stock price:     Let‚Äôs zoom out a little bit:        What are some good indicators Sumifilam will get Breakthrough Therapy Designation?     According to the FDA:  >A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug:   >   >intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and   >   >preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development  Sumifilam satisfies both of these requirements and you can bet your autistic ass that our octogenarian politicians are pushing for this type of groundbreaking Alzheimer drug research to receive virtually unlimited funding and a regulatory pass.  Cassava Sciences received government research grants totaled $  million in 2017, $  million in 2018, $  million in 2019, and $  million the first three quarters of 2020.    $  million.    That means that the US government paid for   68%   of the operating costs of this company 2020. This is even more indication that Sumifilam will get the green light from the FDA when it comes to BTD.     What's a reasonable price target on SAVA?     A quick google search reveals 60-70% success rate on phase 3 trials. If we assume the author of this article is correct about his   $286   price target after successful phase 3 trial, we have to give SAVA a   $186   target based on EV. (Disclaimer: I am in no way qualified to give anything a price target)  If you have any more questions please read the fucking article, it's too long for me to finish.  Positions:  885 SAVA, 14 SAVA $15c 2/19, 3 SAVA $15c 3/19
VIAC investor day and the super bowl
A new idea I‚Äôve seen and god knows we need it. I posted others posted, bunch of people are actually following the trade, let‚Äôs talk about how this firm is launching a major new product on the super bowl and then the investor day right after on 2-24 we need to look at this as a new opportunity for profits. I respect all on this forum, the suits are fucking you and  while I fear for those jumping in at the top I will love to see the blood on wall st when GME is at 1000 and all the other wins but this one is a different trade for those that made some wins and need to diversify into new opportunities.   Ok so we have already been winning on VIAC I‚Äôve been on the long side for over a Year and buying calls over the past 4 months.   In currently long VIAC calls for 2-26 3-19 and long dated calls for 2022. Strike prices between 50-55 and 60 on the long dated calls.   Overall my positions are over 15k in calls but I am actively trading and plan to size up even more before the 2-24 investor day. One of my biggest trades ever frankly.   The Reason I like this so much is the Unknown possibilities on content. I‚Äôm talking all the possible good ideas, miramax deal, avatar last air bender series, all kinds of possible shows from paramount.   I‚Äôm not doing this justice because there is so much to discuss it‚Äôs overwhelming. My theory is we could see real advances in content from the firm for all parties including NFLX, AMNZ, DIS, and the other customers that need additional content on top of their existing creation slate.   Up coming investor day will be just like The Disney investor day in that we will be blown away with surprise of ambition. I expect the redstones have been waiting 5 years for this event and they will make the most of it. We can expect so much possibilities from this 2 months ahead for VIAC if your not interested  in the trade then do your own thing but if you want to make money climb the fuck aboard. Do your own research but if you do I think you will get very excited.  Edit:  For those who need the     this one is getting really exciting and I‚Äôm already in orbit headed for Pluto so get ready for the fucking journey!

DD $GOEV / Canoo's potential AAPL Partnership with a side of short squeeze
First I want to congratulate us on breaking 8 million degenerates. I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I‚Äôm a little retarded so please go easy on me.   For everyone who doesn‚Äôt want to read a wall of text there‚Äôs a   TL:DR   at the bottom.    Technical Setup:    Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital‚Äôs retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven‚Äôt been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out.              Fundamental Setup:    GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.      Canoo‚Äôs leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC  cough   NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few.   The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the    Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that‚Äôs not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car‚Ä¶ the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to connect these dots.         My position:    I am holding shares as well as options. I recommend shares as it is the safer bet. We all know how long hedge-funds can hold a stock down for and burn your theta.            TL:DR    1. Positioned to take advantage of Biden's Federal vehicle electrification plan 2. Veteran leadership from BMW & Tesla 3. Partnership with Hyundai & KIA; Potentially Apple 4. Lot of shorts to squeeze (~11 million shares short) 5.

My journey
GME and what I've learned about the market.
Ok Tards,  Like the rest of you, I bandwagoned GME hard and became part of the cult. Lucky for me, I've been losing money here for years and got that panic urge to do my own DD the other day.  Having gone through  literally thousands  of posts, I've realized most of you are folding tinfoil into hats and turning relatively mundane things into full-blown conspiracies. For real y'all are becoming Flat Earthers. Here's what I mean.  1.   Short Ladder Attacks   \- Not a real thing. Someone here made this term up. 2.   Synthetic Shares   \- Very cool and very legal. Synthetic shares were created by the Shorts buying calls to hedge their bets. Lets say you short 100 shares of a stock at $5 and buy 1 $5 call. Despite not actually possessing any shares, you are still technically "long" 100 shares. This  could have  thrown off Short Interest numbers, but it also makes it easier for Shorts to recover/get shares/make margin calls. 3.   Twitter Viking   \- I would bet you my car this is a Red Herring used for crowd control. Everything about this feels like a persona created to appeal to 25-30yo dudes. An altruistic Powerlifter Billionaire who also wrote all of the commonly used trading algorithms? Sounds like Dan Bilzerian's fantasy LinkedIn. 4.   You can Sell, but not Buy   \- This was shady as fuck. The Brokerages fucked up with how they handled this. Unlikely to be a conspiracy though, just small brokers leveraged to the tits during a retail feeding frenzy. That's the issue with instant deposits - they didn't have the liquidity to keep fronting you autists until your money cleared. 5.   "But they need our shares!"   \- Not any time soon, unless the stock goes back to \~$250  independent of a squeeze . Yeah, Melvin and Citron got screwed. They lost money. But they do this for a living, so they just reentered their positions at the top (or bought puts for April). They will end 2021 with a net gain on this. 6.   "But the Squeeze never Squoze! It's only a matter of time!"   \- Maybe, maybe not. There still might be a squeeze, but it will not be the MOASS you're creaming yourselves over. SI is somewhere between 50% and 70%. High, but not the 140% of last month. 7.   "But VW! 2008! $1000/share!!!"   \- First of all, GME gained more  by percent  than VW. Second, that was an Institutional Investor locking up the shares. The rules are different at the BigBoi table. They can see and do things we simply can't.  Please do your own research. FFS even gamblers learn the rules of the games they play.  Disclosure: I no longer have a stake in GME. I exited with a small profit. This is not financial advice, I was dropped on my head as a child.
Well, if you insist...

More specifically: We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!    Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of   shares by some insiders (totally normal as it‚Äôs mostly the private equity owner ‚Äì EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from   to   ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit).    Here‚Äôs the prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021):    1) Now, check out page 9 of the document    For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:    ‚Ä¢ Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million    ‚Ä¢ Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million    ‚Ä¢ Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million    Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates‚Ä¶    In fact, the company initially estimated the following (from Q3 release      For the full year 2020, we currently expect:    ‚Ä¢ Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.    ‚Ä¢ Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.    ‚Ä¢ Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193  , they updated the guidance on November 30th 2020 (     For the full year 2020, we currently expect:    ‚Ä¢ Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million. ‚Ä¢ Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million. ‚Ä¢ Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.    So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!    2) But that‚Äôs not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again‚Ä¶ we just need to look).    As they mention on the Q3 report, ‚Äúas of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $  million, $  million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $  million‚Äù.In the more recent prospectus (page 10):    In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $  million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.    This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter. As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So this implies around 150M FCF in 2020 (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).    (check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here      At $39, Corsair has a   market cap (  of shares outstanding).    This is a very respectable cash flow yield of   I‚Äôd be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (  growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of   in Q4).Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!    I used to be like you‚Ä¶ I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things!    No f    way!!!    Take a look at Goldman Sachs‚Äô research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published).    Someone shared it on reddit         They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated ‚Äúguidance‚Äù (more than a guidance, it‚Äôs actually the results given how close the ranges are‚Ä¶)    TLDR: Corsair      Positions: 40k in shares

You Don't Have to Buy on Margin! Preserve Your Mental Capital!
I  know some people are trapped in GME on margin.    I know you want to leverage to the tits and have unreal gains.  Buying on margin is actually hurting the cause. Here's why:     Margin is a loan.    If you buy with a loan, you can lose more than you started with.   if you can lose more than you started with, it will affect your psychology.       shakey diamond hands   If you are in on margin and you are losing, you can get margin called      your broker will sell for you         that's selling         your broker will paper hand for you      this can cause a panic  Buying with money you can afford to lose is good for the cause. Here's why:     The security of having money elsewhere will bring you comfort on red days   You can always add when you get more money. Probably at a discount.    Psychologically stable       the worst that can happen is you lose your whole investment (if GME = $0)   As people buy with money they don't need, we find a stable supply balance   As we stabilize supply, price stabilizes       we need a stable base (consolidation) from which to launch     Not financial advice. I had dog food for breakfast because I thought it was    # P√¢t√©.   I couldn't figure out how to do special characters, so I copy/pasted    # P√¢t√©     Again. Not financial advice.  $320 Crew. Looking to average down when we get a supply balance. I'm an investor at this point. lmao

How to take advantage of passive investment manager strategies: PSTG & NNDM
TLDR  :  56% of asset flows into global markets come from passive vehicles like ETF‚Äôs and buy and hold strategies with minimal turnover. With increased passive flows into the market, this means that by finding upcoming additions to ETF‚Äôs and these strategies, you can front run ETF additions and reap the gains that come with that.  My positions:    PSTG       Bought 50 May calls @$30  Sold 25 may put spreads @ $25/$20  Net credit: $1,735  Max Loss: 8k  Max Gain: unlimited  Target Price: $40-$45 next 3m, $75 year end    NNDM       Bought 30 May calls    Sold 75 May put spreads @ $ $   Bought 50 march puts @$10  Net Credit: $7k  Max Loss: Occurs between $10 ‚Äì $  24k  Max gain: unlimited.  Target Price: $50 next 3 months, $60 year end    Full DD  :  My fellow degens, it has been quite some time since my last DD posts: XME (   And for an update on how those went, XME is at $33 and some change, and APPS is pushing $64. Both exceedingly met my minimum targets.  But back to what this post is really all about. Today I am here to bring to light my background in finance and 2 additional stock picks for this year and into 2022 so you fucks can reap the tendies from the unintended inefficiencies our great investment industry has brought about. So without further or do:  Since 2000 the investment management industry has heavily pushed for passive investing from managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, in order to deal with the double-edged blade of underwhelming performance and high fees. Several studies have been made over the years that found that the investor‚Äôs #1 enemy was themselves, with Fidelity finding that the average investor return the past 20 years being roughly  , (primarily because investors would jump in and out of investments during moments of panic (08 for example). While the S&P rose   annualized during the same time period.  However, the utter destruction of value in 08, led to a massive transition to passive investment vehicles to ‚Äúdiversify risk exposures‚Äù and a further push towards a buy and hold mentality.  When you look back at the data during these periods, investors who jumped out at or near the bottom of 08, didn‚Äôt recover until after 2012, where investors who held the whole time recovered by 2010. Today, we have roughly 56% of assets flows into the market entering from these passive vehicles, which is up from 23% back in 2007. \   \ below is a link covering how passive funds have now exceeded the actively managed funds in the market. Further research on this can be found in CFAI's research database.     \ for clarification on what I mean by passive flows, these are ETFs, index, or strategy that purpose is to track a basket of stocks or securities with minimal turnover. Additionally, these include assets held in retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, pensions, and other asset manager portfolios.  Because of this massive increase in passive flows, this ironically brings some new trading opportunities and risks to the individual/institutional investor that was not immediately present:  1. This massive indexation of assets increases correlations among securities to a degree in which you need machine learning techniques to fully understand relationships 2. Illiquidity risk: the buy and hold strategy also depletes the available supply of stocks in the market. As we saw with GME, at least 45% of the total supply was held by 10 different asset managers in their ETF portfolios, Thus reducing the amount of stock available to borrow and increasing the probability of these short squeeze situations. The downside to this is that should everyone panic or have a need for cash, you get violent downward moves like we had last March due to supply being flooded into the market. 3. Once you understand the metrics used to find new additions to these portfolio strategies, one can front-run additions to passive strategies, causing massive gains.  Point 3 is where I really want to hit on. With all the data available to us, finding opportunities to front-run passive funds because much easier. As we have seen with Cathy Wood and Ark Investment Management, she is a pop star in finance now. People flock to her stock picks just because of the calls she made‚Ä¶ But the best part? Other Investment managers now want a piece of that action.  So this is where I bring you to my stock picks: NNDM and PSTG  These are two sub-$30 stocks in her Ark fund ETF portfolios that are being added to BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Jp Morgan‚Äôs upcoming innovation funds. These funds mimic and add leverage to the ARK funds such as JPM‚Äôs 3x ARKK fund, or hold the same/similar holdings.  NNDM is an Israeli tech company and has been on a   since October when ARK started adding it to their portfolios. Usually, ARK continues adding to their portfolios over a 1-3y timeline and holds for a minimum of 3 years. This sucker could easily continue to pop up as more positions are added.    PSTG   is another addition ARK has been making in their funds, tech company based near Silicon Valley, delivers data storage, encryption, and protection solutions in block-storage. Given the rise to this specialized form of data management, this a solid long-term bet on the transition of the tech industry.  Both of these stocks have solid futures because of the innovation tilts they have. But in the mean-time, thanks to the low price and cheap call options on these stocks. This is definitely something to take advantage of before they begin to get expensive.  If you followed my previous posts, you know I like taking a relatively lower risk, high return bets with minimal upfront output. So my plays are as follows:    PSTG  : target 3months $40-$45, year end- $75  Bought 50 May calls @$30  Sold 25 may put spreads @ $25/$20  Net credit: $1,735  Max Loss: 8k  Max Gain: unlimited  Risks: Due to the credit spread, this locks up a significant margin and as such, if the stock falls between the spread by expiration, you will need to coffer up the difference. So even though you are being paid   for making this play, you will be taking significant risks should it fall between the spread and you are on margin. Good to have cash handy should you decide to do a trade like this. I recommend buying puts to hedge out the possibility of a market dump, this will dilute your net credit received, but you have protection.    NNDM  : Target -3months: $50, year end $60  Bought 30 May calls @$20  Sold 75 May put spreads @ $ $   Bought 50 march puts @$10  Net Credit: $7k  Max Loss: Occurs between $10 ‚Äì $  24k  Max gain: unlimited.  Risks: Again because there is a spread, we do have the same margin lock-up provision. However, adding the puts below $10 provides some insurance should we have a market dump. The goal here is to offset the costs of the spread with there being a market dump and thus, be neutral at the end.  These trades are primarily to take advantage of the additions that investment managers will be making later this year. This will passively push prices upwards on a quarterly basis. With March on the way, its a solid time to get in prior to the quarterly addition  So degens, here are two trades for you for the year, and more yet to come. Keep hedged and get them tendies.  Side note: I'll update in quarterly intervals. My time horizons are generally 3 months long  in order to fully take advantage of how investment managers reallocate their funds.
Whats the story on these knuckleheads? I cant read.
We should buy a Super Bowl ad (fuck Robinhood)
In light of Robinhood running a Super Bowl ad I think we should have one too.      30 seconds of Super Bowl ads cost approximately $3 million. We now have at least 3 million real people and approximately 5 million bots. Less than $1 apiece gets a voice on national television.   If we could find a way to pool money, we could air a competing ad that is pure meme shitting on Robinhood/ Prince John Financial.  Maybe the mods could organize collecting funds (if y‚Äôall give me $3m I‚Äôd take it and run)?   TL;DR  fuck Robinhood let‚Äôs buy super bowl ad space and shit on them
Don't plan on seeing that money again. But shoving my dick even a little bit down the throats of some cunts just sounded too good to pass up
I knew this would end bad - GME
I knew going into GME, that the rocket was going to crash hard. I don‚Äôt know why I thought we might actually see a thousand first though. So many lessons learned here. I would hate to be someone who threw their life savings at this thing. All over hype about ‚Äúlet‚Äôs take down a hedge fund.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is for 2008.‚Äù I hope everyone realizes that nothing has changed. And everyone who invested should be pissed they stopped it in its tracks at 500. Oh well. I can‚Äôt believe people are still buying in. I can‚Äôt imagine buying the top. You know it‚Äôs over when ‚Äúwanna to be rappers‚Äù on Twitter, and your friends cousin are talking about taking down the establishment by trading stocks. At least next time I‚Äôll know when to sell.
TOMORROW‚ÄôS THE DAY. BUY THE FUCKING DIP
THE HEDGEHOGS ARE PLAYING WITH YOUR HEAD
Listen up smooth brains, this is not financial advice. I am an ape.   Short interest is now up to an estimated 220%. These motherfuckers doubled down again - see here     Expect these ladder attacks to keep coming this week, possibly even next. Stop trying to put a date on the MOASS. Every time you do, it doesn‚Äôt happen, morale drops lower, and more people get out. These ladders are beneficial to us. It allows us to lower our average cost, and buy up even more shares. We have time on our side.   These hedge funds have been in the game for decades, but they are still using the same old tricks. They want these brutal red days, so when it finally goes green even a little bit, more people will paperhand and sell.   Well if I know anything about wsb, our hands are made of the strongest fucking diamonds on earth. One retard gambled a loan for school, a different retard gambled his mortgage.   These hedgehogs don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre up against. They have no idea the power that the autism of the people in this sub wield.   When it turns green, hold. Wait until the fucking moon landing. 10k is not a meme. They saw us posting this, and dropped our morale. We have time on our side. Be patient young tards, be patient.   Put in only what you can lose, and hold your shares tighter than your wife‚Äôs boyfriends hand when he takes you to Wendy‚Äôs for your morning shift.   Be strong wsb, and don‚Äôt let up at the first sight of green.


Put another 10k in. We will win this shit. Dont fold!

Fuck the squeeze, I'm in it for the long qual.
I know I may get downvoted for this... but at this point honestly   fuck the squeeze.    This could be a lifelong hold into some serious generational wealth. I'm in it for the qualitative now.    For all you retards who can‚Äôt read and are just      ... üß†=   ‚àû    Look at what‚Äôs happened today alone...  Matt Francis, new GameStop Chief Tech Officer formerly from AWS, lead engineer. Think about that for sec... The guy who is responsible for Amazon's web services. Amazon IS fucking web services, well, it's also fulfilment of course. This is still retail we‚Äôre talking about.  Josh Krueger, new GameStop VP of Fulfillment formerly from Amazon, Walmart, QVC. I shouldn't need to tell you why this is a big move. Looks like the guy has literally been growing in the same exact fucking direction as the industry. Next in line for him, Gamestop  Kelli   MF   Durkin, new GameStop Sr VP of Customer Care, previously from CHEWY. Everything people love about Chewy that made it such a lovable brand comes from their customer service dpt. They'll leave the UXUI up to Matt and his team while Kelli‚Äôs team keeps on making the customer‚Äôs come back to buy more. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of good customer service. I‚Äôve straight up switched ISP‚Äôs because of this.  Now, combine this dream team, with the (un)expected possibility of Ryan Cohen becoming CEO. This really is some Avengers End Game shit.  This fucking super team could really turn GameStop into the one-stop-game-shop everything gaming related. I‚Äôm talking build-a-pc centers with the next-gen GPU‚Äôs/CPUs hitting exclusively GME first (re: fulfillment), online streaming community (aka Twitch/Amazon), sharing revenue on cloud-based game streaming platforms (like MSFT GamePass), combined with a dedication to their customer.   That‚Äôs fucking YOU, YOU RETARD!    Okay, now for a very light amount of quantitative speculation. Imagine holding your current amount of shares, the stock eventually hits $400 and it splits 8:1. Now, with 8x more shares you slowly climb up to $1000. Maybe it splits again along the way, who fucking knows, you do the math. Yeah it‚Äôs that same hypothetical math you‚Äôve been doing the past week only... 1x your current share amount. Kinda makes you want to get more shares.  Obligatory, I am most certainly a retard, so this is not advice so please don‚Äôt listen to me. Only a fool on a rant.
Jokes on you RH. I was ready to buy on Thursday - now I‚Äôve got 30 shares instead of 10. Good luck taking them from my

DOWN 20K AND STILL HOLDING
Listen apes, it has been a rough week, there is no denying that, but the plan has not changed.    WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.    This is what got us here in the first place. Why we are even having this conversation. In the mainstream media, in the twitter feeds of billionaires, of Mark fucking Cuban doing an AMA on here, and telling us to   HOLD  .  If you bought into GME for a quick flip to double your portfolio and make tendies like I did, than you may have made a mistake. But here's the thing, I will repeat it again for all you retards to understand...    YOU ONLY LOSE IF YOU SELL.    Mark had some incredibly solid words of wisdom yesterday. Why should you listen to him? Because he is a billionaire entrepreneur and a no-bullshit guy. He didn't come on here to lie to us. He came on here to genuinely help us.    SO, WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?    We need to   HOLD  . We need to hold because the lower this stock goes, the more leverage we have. We need to hold because we are not pussy fucking paper hands, and this is the way. GameStop, with the leadership of Ryan Cohen, is going to capitalize on this primetime opportunity. We are already seeing this today with the hire of Matt Francis. The shift to e-commerce is real. The shift to steaming, and the possibility of digital trading. If GameStop continues to take advantage of this opportunity right in front of their retard faces, they are going to revolutionize the video game industry.  Believe in this stock, and the long-term growth potential. Why?   Because you have no fucking choice.   Netflix trades daily for $300+, Amazon at 3k+. Is GameStop the next Amazon? HELL NO, but the growth potential is there, and it is real.  Be prepared for the long haul. To   HOLD   this stock to your fucking grave.  One way or another, we are going to take this stonk on a   to the fucking  .  Edit: Emojis added for the BIG TIME retards and apes.

Except for losing life savings ofcourse, like actually think about this.

Ladder long attack!!!!
Obviously at this point people are feeling pretty dejected but I think its important to remember why this ran in the first place --  it ran because lots of people were buying because we like this fucking stock.  This post isn't trying to coordinate a concerted effort to move the market, I'm just trying to state the obvious here. If everybody bought 1 share a day (or multiple times a day) it would give this a lot of momentum and effectively act as a reverse of the short ladder attacks.  Now one thing I have been considering is whether or not there is a more effective way to buy that would cause max upward pressure to the stock. My suspicion is that buying 1 at a time would actually cause more upward pressure but the main key here is that MARKET BUYING instead of limit buying will cause more upward pressure. The reason seems simple. When you market buy, you are effectively saying that you will take whatever the next ask price is. The ask will obviously always be on the higher side of the spread. So, if you buy 1 on market, and then the next guy buys 1 on market, and so on, you are basically maintaining pressure towards the high end of the spread. Conversely if someone comes in and buys limit (and there are no other willing buyers at a higher price) then the seller would have to come down to your price if he wants to get filled (causing downward pressure).       TLDR: Market buy 1 share at a time (not 100 at a time)       \ This isn't financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. I'm only making theoretical observations and conclusions. This is post is not attempting to make a coordinated effort to move or effect markets. I think Elmers glue tastes the best.

PSA Meme Brokers Will Never Support Us Enough
I'm going to be posting these periodically and if it helps even one person from getting screwed like everyone did last week, then I'll consider it a win.  Unpopular opinion that no one wants to hear:   RH really could not have helped this. Their clearing house wanted 3 billion in collateral. 3 fucking billion, and they wanted it right now. RH handled this poorly. They did not communicate it well, they didn't ever really explain it well, and they kept us in the dark for far longer than acceptable. But they had no choice, was Vlad just supposed to pull 3 billion dollars out of his ass and put it up?  Meme brokers like RH, WeBull, et al. who advertise commissions free trading like this and don't have as much capital to back themselves will do this again. They can't, and therefore won't, be able to support you during huge market events. They're too small. That sucks, it fucking sucks, but you can't disrupt the market with a broker that doesn't have a trillion dollar balance sheet like Cuban said. If you stay with them and we get fucked over again IT'LL BE YOUR FAULT YOU IDIOT.  It's great that they got a new generation of people interested in trading. It's great they provided free access to the stock market. It's great they made an app that doesn't make me want to blow my brains out when I use it. But it's time to grow up and move on to a real broker like real traders use.  If Fidelity was asked to put up the 3 billion for this? They have fucking trillions they wouldn't have batted an eye. The squeeze would've squoze and you'd all be fighting overwhelmed customer service reps to order your lambos RIGHT FUCKING NOW. I'm not saying the squeeze can't get squoze still, but it's not looking nearly as juicy and we've lost many key elements that would allow it.  Switch to a real broker. I only know Fidelity but others are probably good others, too. Trading shares is FREE. Yeah, you're gonna have to pay a small fee for options. Get over it. We've all been told there's no such thing as a free lunch and now we're all eating dogshit because we didn't question something that was too good to be true.  Still holding 200GME until they burn into the ground, but holy fuck am I pissed.  edit:  Reasons to switch:    Helpful link for switching to fidelity

We shall never surrender. Every hour is our finest hour!
We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in GameStop, we shall fight on AMC and other meme stocks, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the people, we shall defend our Tendies, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills, wherever we have internet; we shall never surrender.   What the Main Stream Media called the Battle of the Short Squeeze is over. I expect that the Battle of Real Squeeze is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Autist civilization. Upon it depends our own Retard life, and the long continuity of our memes and our SubReddit. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Wall Street knows that they will have to break us in this Stock or lose the war.   If we can stand up to them, all Traders and investors may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands and tendies. But if we fail, then the whole world, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted and restricted trading.   Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, if WallStreetBets and its Allies last for a thousand years, apes will still say, ‚ÄúThis was their finest hour.‚Äù  -Winston Churchill or something

Robinhood did me dirty.
I've used the same bank for the last year or so for my instant deposits, but I had another on file, an older account. Every time I do instant deposits (often) it has always come out of the new account, no problems.   Except for when I went to buy GME on Friday, apparently it charged the old account, so in the meantime of GME crashing, my account is now negative because the security has crashed and my deposit never went through.   So what happens? They turn off my instant deposits so I can't settle my account and can't open new positions. What also happens? They liquidated my GME and AMC shares to cover the debt, sold them right out of my wallet at a massive loss to cover their fuckup.
Look at the limit buy volume just waiting in the depths....

PSA: Stocktwits sells your sentiment data to hedge funds. Maybe don't click the green and red buttons.

StockTwits sells its feed in several different ways:   hedge funds and other money managers pay for access to its data  . Media companies like Bloomberg, Reuters and Yahoo Finance draw on the StockTwits feed for real time opinion and context on news. And the company has also quietly released an API which is being used by financial startups like Estimize and Trading View. "We're building out our own ecosystem with a broad range of partners across finance, media and tech," says Phil Perlman, StockTwits' executive editor.     Their public API does not have the "Sentiment data", only their Partner-level license.     I wonder what the full Sentiment data is? It's probably not just the button, I'm sure it's easy to group together certain words related to various tickers to get a general overview of bull/bear spam in real time (and to filter out various server-farmed-bot-spams, but maybe allow the hedge fund bots for $?).

NOK DD for the few remaining retards who actually like making money
I know you retards have brains so smooth you'd be able to see your own reflection if it weren't for the massive dents in your heads, but get together for a group reading session because I'm going to summarize as succinctly as possible in four key points why you should be looking at NOK as your next play     :      (1)   No, they don't do phones anymore, that part of their business was licensed out. Their main focus now is being incredibly well-positioned as a major player in the emerging 5G infrastructure game, and have been dumping billions into R&D building themselves up to this point. With the western world wanting Chinese companies (Huawei, ZTE) out due to national security concerns, they are set up as one of two major players to scoop up a large portion of the market share in the US and Europe as the 5G rollout snowballs harder and harder in the coming years. Plus, they have over 3000 patents that basically fortify their position in this regard.     (2)   They have recently replaced their CEO with a certified asskicker named Pekka Lundmark who has a consistent record of happy shareholders and success within global business-to-business technology companies. The man even worked for Nokia back in their heyday before leaving to go chalk up some more wins, and now he is back to make Nokia a global powerhouse once more.     (3)   Everyone complaining about the size of float is a    of the same variety that said that GME would never stay above $12 a couple months ago. Just last week NOK spiked hard on volume before getting kicked in the nuts as a collateral damage from brokerages neutering GME and co. For now the crayon munchers of the trading world brainlessly associate NOK with the squeeze plays because they saw it and WSB in the same sentence, but once that fog clears and the collective room temperature IQ of the broader market finally processes that NOK is actually a solid play, interest will drive volume into a cascading repeat of what started to happen last week.     (4)   Nokia is currently discounted when measured up against pretty much any comparable company on a P/E basis. This is likely due to pessimism surrounding recent trends in their financials, but that is what happens when you make temporary cuts to hone your business into a laser-focused money printer for the singular purpose of domination in the wireless infrastructure sector. The boomer bean-counters don't seem to understand that plowing money into R&D and restructuring a business into a lean, mean, 5G machine = long term growth, which this market has shown itself to reward generously and this will likely begin to price in sooner rather than later. (Hence why now is the time to take the boomers' shares from them at boomer prices and get your one-way ticket to the moon before the rest of the glue eaters realize what is happening and buy at the top as they so like to do).    Bonus Point:   Nokia is literally putting 4G on the moon. If this isn't a sign for you I don't know what is.                Positions:   Long 18,133 shares.
Greed & The Moving Goalpost. Winners & Losers.
I HOPE ALL OF YOU MAKE MONEY  . Please before you downvote, hear me out and read the post.  Exactly as the title says, I have been concerned about the moving goalpost by some people and the greed that it conveys. Related to GME, $  was a meme price target for a while until it was hit and people just moved their goalposts to something higher. It seems that people need to learn how to take profits at some point. We are here to make money arent we, so dont give me that altruistic line about holding forever and joining together for something bigger than ourselves. You are participating in the market,   There are Winners and there are Losers  , and my advice for some of these new people are to pick a price and sell at that price. Now if your price is $1000/share or beyond, thats great and I hope you reach it, but my comments are specifically targeted at the people who never intended to make money and instead treated this all like purchasing a ticket to some kind of bourgeoisie rebellion. Pick a price and learn to take profits at some point so you can continue participating in the market.    I HOPE ALL OF YOU MAKE MONEY
Wall Street Journal - what a respectable source of news. GME sheds, but it‚Äôs up nearly 11%. Good one.
I‚Äôm done
We had ‚Äòem. We would‚Äôve squeezed that shit past Kilimanjaro. We would‚Äôve damn near bankrupted the hedge fund and possibly a few brokers and we would‚Äôve made a lot of money. And it was all going to be done legally.   Then they fucked us. They changed the rules. They raised the requirements. They limited our abilities. They manipulated the market. They lied to the media. And it was all done illegally.   And as I reflect on the millions of retards yoloing their student loans, clearing their life savings and sucking cock for a few extra shares, I feel fucking enraged. And it‚Äôs more than just the way they talk about us as immature, stupid, reckless, ‚Äúa threat‚Äù that could ‚Äúdestabilize the market‚Äù in the public.   We‚Äôre still in a pandemic where our govt response has been pathetic. Widespread failure to test and now to vaccinate, tens of millions unemployed, more & more entering poverty, delayed and insufficient stimulus checks, PPP dollars looted by wealthy corporations and individuals, the message is clear. THEY DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT US   Republicans and Democrats alike are part of our American kleptocracy. This country is run by corporate oligarchs. It‚Äôs all about money - do you think the SEC is gonna do shit about any of this? Do you think Robinhood is going to have any real consequences? Do you think anyone gives a fuck about retail investors losing money? It‚Äôs always a menial slap on the wrist and the show goes on.   It was like this under Bush, Obama, Trump and will be like this under Biden. Bank bailouts, tax benefits and havens overseas, empty promises to the average American while healthcare and education and cost of living expenses skyrocket and our incomes stay the same. Inequality is skyrocketing, especially during the pandemic. You think some of these fuckers need billions of extra dollars while millions of Americans can‚Äôt pay the bills? We‚Äôre all excited about a massive wealth redistribution - shouldn‚Äôt the wealth be distributed already? Isn‚Äôt it kinda fucked up they will break the law to make sure it‚Äôs not while politicians and law enforcement sit back and do nothing?   You wanna know why so many people hopped on the GME train? It‚Äôs not whatever mocking caricature was in the media. Underneath is a desperation to experience economic relief, to pay the bills, to buy a house, to cover medical costs, to experience just a sliver of what the top 1% steal from the American public everyday. This country doesn‚Äôt take care of its citizens and intends to keep it that way. Fuck this country. Fuck the people in power who act like they give a shit.  Edit: I‚Äôm still holding 24 shares and will sell for no less than 10k

Fidelity will NOT let me trade due to RH transfer
I'm curious if anyone else experiencing this. I am a long time Fidelity customer and have been trading using my Brokerage there for a while. I also have (had) a RH account that I promptly transferred to Fidelity after last Thursdays market manipulation. I have not been able to trade (buy or sell) for 36 hours now due to the RH transfer and Fidelity keeps telling me wait 1 more day!? I have funds in my account that have nothing to do w/ RH shares being transferred. I've called them twice now and always get the same answer (Call if you want to make a trade (2+ hour wait time BTW)).  Before anyone asks:    I am not negative, I have positive cash to trade (regardless of RH)   I have been told twice, by fidelity, this is due to the RH transfer?     tl;dr: Fidelity not allowing me to trade for last 36 hours, states this will last another 24 hrs due to RH transfer.    Edit 1  : This seem to be standard practice given the comments below.

ZNGA earnings report to be released February 10th
A few quick facts about Zynga:    2019 saw a 45% revenue growth over 2018, and based on the first three quarters of 2020, they are on track to again have 45% year-over -ear (YoY) revenue growth.    YoY earnings-per-share growth at the end of 2018 was 88%, 2019 was 52%, and 2020 is shaping up to be about 42%.    Share price over the last few years has been increasing in tandem with the above mentioned growth.    The mobile gaming industry is growing at a truly remarkable rate. And given the less social interaction that the pandemic has forced upon the world, it only goes to reason that more people are spending time entertaining themselves on their phones.    The 2020 earnings release is next week Wednesday (Feb. 10th).   Do your own due diligence, but I like this company and their aggressive growth strategies.

CVAC is the next vaccine stock
These dudes have an MRNA covid vaccine in phase three trials in Europe and elsewhere.   Pfizer and Moderna have already proven the efficacy and safety of this class of vaccines that seem to be superior to adenovirus based vaccines.    CVACs vaccine can be stored for months in a regular fridge unlike the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines which require freezers and ultra-cold freezers respectively.   Their gen1 vaccine provoked good T cell and B cell responses in non-human primates.   CVAC just signed a production deal with Bayer and a partnership with GSK to test a multivalent vaccine against emerging spike variants  All vaccine stonks spike after release of phase 3 results and CVAC expects phase three results this quarter.

GameStop Irony
Besides all the noise what do you guys see in this company?  What am I missing.  I am long term investor and love to make some quick cash.  I don't like the current stock manipulation and I think Wall Street made a bad decision.  Conspiracies aside what is good about GameStop?  Not to long ago you could see trending stories about how GameStop has the worst business model, customer support, and trade in prices.  I myself rarely bought anything from GameStop because it was never convenient.  It was like going to a car salesman which I now do online too. PC games for the most part were always sold online.  I remember as soon as consoles caught up to online downloads I never bought a physical game again.  GameStop's atmosphere always sucked and looked like a dated museum.  I much rather of gone into BestBuy or Target.  GameStop is also a pawn shop model with games and gimmick collector toys.  eBay & Amazon already dominate this used market.  People want to buy new things and the used market has been established for a long time.  What is positive about GameStop?  The pre-order line waits and the memories having to wait for Halo or Gears of War.  That is an archaic thing that no one longer does.  Pre-orders can be placed from the comfort of a home and the download queued.  GameStop recently hired a eCommerce CEO.  The only thing that can keep GameStop going at this point is consumer loyalty.  No one is buying from GameStop.  All of the GME shareholders do not buy games from GameStop and will not.  Shareholders are obsessed with hording money and making money.  So after Wall Street short sellers are beaten, I believe GME will become a worthless piece of trash.  Edit: Also another note I think WSB will just become Wall Street after this.  Once the money transfers all the crooked shady ruthlessness' will continue online on chat forums like this one.

At this point it‚Äôs not about money - this crime needs accountability
Sup retards, like all of you Ive been watching GME price being driven down as I   owe us a squeeze and we can still get it!  We‚Äôve seen several takes on the brokers‚Äô decision to restrict retail  buying  in some cases allowing  sell  orders only.  But what is usually left unsaid is that   for someone to  sell , there has to be someone on the other side  buying  - so by preventing retail from buying, the only option is selling to them and they get to cover their shorts.    At the same time   they get to set the price because retail cannot take the buying side of the trade to balance the supply demand   ... pair that with a relentless media FUD   and they‚Äôre   making the ‚Äúinfluenceable‚Äù retail investor help them cover their shorts at lower prices  .   They cannot cover their shorts if retail investors hold a substantial amount of the volume out of the market - even if they lend our shares, they‚Äôll just be covering shorts by creating new shorts - meaning short interest remains unchanged and the squeeze will have to be  squoze  eventually. Why? Because the more they wait the more they spend on interest, and going forward more good news are coming regarding the business transition to e-commerce (like today‚Äôs appointment of new CTO)  TLDR: if ~~retail investors~~   hold    =   =   get ü§úüëå   Disclaimer: Idk wtf I‚Äôm talking about, I‚Äôm a retard.

Clarification on "short ladder" attacks and Round Lots vs Odd Lots
So I have seen a lot of posts pointing to GME (and others) volume as an indication of short ladder attacks. While I‚Äôm not claiming they are or aren‚Äôt happening, I think it is important to understand how institutional trading works. For reference, I work on the sell side so im a semi-suit (im not an execution trader, but I have enough friends who are).  You may notice that these stocks trade in 100 share increments, this is by design and has a name, they‚Äôre called ‚Äúround lots‚Äù and are used to break up large orders. These round lots are used by every single institution in order to not smash through the bid/ask walls and ensure orderly markets. They are not evidence of a short ladder attack.  Think about it, if a fund wanted to buy $1,000,000,000 worth of AAPL, they could never place a market order as they would move the market against them, and a limit order would never fill. They could use a dark pool to buy without advertising their order, or find a willing partner for a block trade. They also, very frequently have to use low touch VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) algos (much different than prop algos) to buy in the open markets on an exchange. These algorithms ingest the order, and then execute the trade based on a predefined % of volume, ie. the sell side execution trader never wants his/her orders to take up more than xx% of volume. As the algo operates throughout the day, it executes thousands of round lot trades. These round lot trades are the 100 share increments you see each day. All the 100 share increments mean is that you are seeing institutional volume mixed in with odd lot trades (blocks not in increments of 100 shares).    TLDR:   100 share blocks are round lots and are not in any way an indication of a short ladder attack, they simply show institutional order flow.    Positions:   30 shares of GME at $   Most importantly...   HOLD THE LINE    Edits with interesting questions:    Q: If you're going to execute a short ladder attack it makes sense to choose a round number like 100    A: They're not choosing 100 shares, their order is much larger, probably thousands or tens of thousands of shares. The algo breaks up that order into 100 share round lots and executes the trade. The reason for this is simple, its easy to match  100 share lots than it is to try to piece together orders. If the seller is asking $  for 100 shares, the buyer can bid $  for 100 shares and the match is made. If you have 13 shares at one price, 29 shares at another price, and 91 shares at another price on both the bid and ask side, complexity increases materially.    Q: Why do I see a lot of odd lots in AH trading?    A: Because order flow from retail brokerages too thin to combine market orders into a single round lot once it makes its way over to a MM, so they just execute an odd lot order. It is what they have to do and is the last part of my answer above.
AMC YOLO Update 2/3/21 - Still in from Jan 22.
I‚Äôm In You Monkey Futher Muckers üêí
GME YOLO Update - 2/3/21. Bought the dip yesterday. Still holding.
BB loss porn. This sucks. Anyone else in similar boat? I guess since they‚Äôre shares I‚Äôll just average down and hold, but can‚Äôt help but wonder if I‚Äôm just buying into a sinking company. Thoughts?
Not just a holder, but a shareHODLER!
I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. My brain is glassy smooth.  TLDR: Do what you can to increase the value of GME; You can do this by holding with conviction, buying more shares, understanding the value of GME and GameStop, increase Goodwill, spending, and publicity of GameStop, and participate in once-a-year shareholder meetings.  Many of us bought GME for the quick buck and had the hedge funds not pulled their bullshit last week, it would have popped off. Instead, they have mitigated some risk and pushed back the deadline, trying to buy themselves more time in the hopes that we will give up and sell. In turn, many of us are tapped out or overleveraged (seriously, don‚Äôt bet more than you can afford to lose, if you are over that amount already, do what you can to mitigate. Also, determine your risk tolerance!)  The hedge funds looked at the events last week and changed tactics. ShareHODLERS can as well. Understand that this is a long term strategy, but whether you plan to hold the stock for a short term or a long term, this is beneficial to all of us and GME. We don‚Äôt know when the full squeeze will happen, thus a longer term strategy on top of your current will benefit us all.  What does being a shareHODLER mean? Now that you own a share or more of GME, Gamestop has a fiduciary requirement to maximize the VALUE of the stock. As a ShareHODLER, you can help them, and in turn, increase demand for your shares by doing any of the following.  Things you can do to be a good GME shareHODLER: A) Hold your shares with conviction. B) Increase your voting power: BUY more shares if it's within your risk tolerance and you are not overleveraged. C) Understand the future VALUE of the shares you hold. I highly recommend checking out   which was created by WSB members - question this, challenge it, and come to your own conclusions. They make a fair argument that GME is legitimately worth $32 and $169, but that does not consider the positive impact that this all squeeze will have on the company; more customers will hear about the Executive‚Äôs efforts to rebuild the brand, more people will choose to buy from GameStop instead of Amazon, etc. To consider the impact of this, I propose a multiplier of between   and   (bear case - $  to $ ; bull case $  to $  Remember: The stock market deals in future value, not present day value. Additionally, understand what GameStop has to offer:   and    E) Increase GME‚Äôs goodwill, your spending at GameStop, and promote Gamestop. Goodwill is an asset line item on the fiscal quarterly. ‚ÄúGoodwill and asset impairments‚Äù here:   Anything we can do to increase the fair market value or future value of GME will increase the pressure on short sellers. Yes, this means people spending GME earnings on donations is extremely beneficial as that adds to the Goodwill line item. F) Participate in GME shareholder meetings. Maybe the squeeze gets drawn out or maybe you are long GME. Either way, the shareholder meeting is likely to be around mid-June 2021. If retail investors own over 50% of the voting shares, we can force institutions who have been lending out their shares to recall them (temporarily stop lending their shares to short sellers) so that they can vote to counter retail voting power. Shareholder meetings only occur once a year.
Still not selling! I had friends who bought more at the dip yesterday and I will continue to add as well!
GME TO MARSS!!!
MORE GREENS NEEDED> Please dont let my money go to waste lool
We should decentralize GME positions data by summing all our shares together.
The wall street already have our data that are bought from Robinhood and other brokers. This gives them ton of advantage on figuring out which way to maneuver.  We are already at disadvantage because we do not have a clear picture how much shares WSB actually owns.  There are roughly 28M floating GME shares. If 500k out of 8m WSB subscribers own 56 shares each, it would mean WSB individuals are holding all of the floating. Which would mean shorts couldn‚Äôt have covered a lot past week.   u/lasagnahog1 already piled up lots of data from recent posts. And he is willing to compile all our shares if we want. I propose that we all send him a DM with screenshots of our shares (nothing else, no name, no account numbers).  This way we can unite together and decentralize the power only wall street has as of now.   Power to the players brothers and sisters.  Remember what Mark Cuban said. We individuals can take a hit at wall street. And it is not illegal to say how many shares you have.
Stonks ONLY go up     Green day baby! Everyday I hold, they cry.
Got into the action. Not selling until $690.   . Feels great to be part of a movement.
Nothing to see here, move along... [AMC v GME]

Why people invest in $GME - Written by RauchenwaldC on eToro
In case you forget why people invest in $GME (GameStop Corp New) in the first place. They are aiming to trigger a short squeeze.    There have been people claiming that the shorts already covered their positions. Hell, there have even been paid ads on Twitter claiming Melvin Capital already covered their short positions.    However, today's data at    shows that $GME still has   short interest.    And just in case you wonder what exactly "short interest" is:    Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out.    So, there are still more shares shorted than are available, and for all those shorts to cover their position they would need to buy every share on the market back twice.     Edit for full transparency:    Yes, obviously some of that   shorted the stock at $200 to $400 and are comfortable right now. But, for the last weeks, there has been almost no supply for shares to short, so I don't think that it's a huge percentage and that most short positions are still not profitable.    In addition to that, short positions have to pay interest fees for borrowing the shares to short. So, even those that shorted at $400 and are currently looking at a profit, as long as the price doesn't fall further their profit gets smaller every day until they probably rather close the short position and take their profit than watch the profit disappears because of interest payments.    And, just in case you didn't know, short positions work by borrowing shares and selling them, so for them to close - as mentioned above - means they have to buy back shares. It doesn't matter that much if they shorted at $400 once they close they create buy pressure (demand) on the market and drive the price up.    That's why I am holding my small $GME position in this account and added another   shares in my private account.    Obv. this is just my personal opinion and not financial advice.
I think the Hedge funds messed up this morning and showed their cards. Check out the opening volume on GME and AMC. (Screenshot from 1day-1min charts on TOS). This might have exposed the actual "real" volume
That being said... get in before the squeeze!
Notice how they all look similar except SLV
GME Victory Conditions for Hedge Funds vs. the Unwashed Masses: Actual DD (double down)
I think we should discuss how either side of the trade wins.  We all know about short interest, possible short ladder attacks, low volume, and all that. But there is an argument I read yet: the further the price goes down, the more difficult it is to actually push it lower.   If these funds swapping around shares is the primary driver of the collapse in price, then they will confront a prisoner's dilemma-type situation. Seeing the possibility of the largest bomb in financial history detonating, each financial firm that has gone short knows full well that others want to cut their losses, lick their wounds, and fight another day. As we know if one firm closes some of their shorts, the demand, and the price increase. But the bomb is still there looming in the background.   The worst-case scenario for holders of GME is the steady unloading of shorts over a long period of time, where the de-loading process is less expensive than the margin interest that these firms have to pay to keep their shares. So, think the price of GME remaining steady at like $20 or $30 for months-- an acceptable loss for hedge funds. To do this, almost every short fund would have to agree to collaborate in near-perfect harmony. And, as we know, that is nearly impossible.  It's going to take a really long time for us to go back to $17-- this is just not possible in the short run. To make matters worse for the firms, the short interest increased to around 212%. The bomb has only grown more dangerous. As long as this is the case, you should hold. Months can feel like years, but if we are resilient and GME actually does decently as a company, these short positions are going to bleed out. I just don't see how unwinding these positions is probable when a single closed position could set off the bomb.   But then again, I don't know how to read. And, yes I'd like a large soda with that. GME to the moooooooonnnn

$GME Coal Hands
This is why we need to have better accountability in the markets. Take a look at how friggin similar the graphs were up until they changed the rules. Blocking buys while allowing killed momentum, and the short ladder attacks brought down the rocket by tricking people into selling. This movement was incredible and I was honored to be a part of it (no matter how much money I lost) and I hope we can do it again. Maybe I'm wrong, but these hands turned to coal instead of diamonds. ‚ô¶‚ô¶‚ô¶ ‚ô¶‚ô¶‚ô¶

IFF Update Feb 3 ‚Äî Still plenty of time to get aboard
Hey you guys - Sloth  Just wanted to give you an update on the IFF Short and gamma squeeze opportunity I brought to WSB on Monday.   It is great news! The cost to borrow shares continues rocket upwards ( , and they continue to use borrowed shares to try and keep down the price.     As you can see, the drop at end of day was driven by the shorts selling 15,000 shares. Which doesn't sound like alot, but it is HUGE for such a low volume stock, with low IVs.  Options are little changed:  There is a good options ladder this week (at $135 and $150), and there is a monstrous option gamma squeeze at $150 for Feb 19.  This is also a very valuable company, which will see significant growth in their price to sales multiple, now that their acquisition of DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences is complete.  Here is the Ortex data for yesterday. For some reason I am not able to upload a new screenshot, but it is little changed (just those new shares sold short).  The current number of borrowed (short) shares is at      And yes, I own a position in this stock. This is not investment advice, and all that other stuff. Do your own DD, and please, tell me why I am wrong.  Here are my pros and cons for it overall (on Mobile): Pros:  1 - Completed merger with Dupont Nutrition and Biosciences. One of the big advantages of this merger is it allows IFF to offer full spectrum product development, with an excellent focus on Plant based nutrition. (without disclosing too much, plant based nutrition was the only segment to grow very well during the pandemic, and now tastes as good, or better than dairy based nutrition, so it is set to explode in the USA.)  2 - Consistent dividend growth. IFF tripled their dividends over 10 years. See above for my expectations for further growth in income. And looking back, they have been increasing their dividend since the 90s.  3 - IFF has traded sideways for years, all the while increasing earnings / decreasing their multiples. They are an ignored, low volatility stock.  4 - There is excessive short interest, as far as I can tell (  and Ortex). To me, that means there is good short term upside potential.  5 - ~25% of the outstanding stock is owned by the TetraPak family holding company. They are insiders in this industry, and clearly know who their customers are using to flavor the drinks going into TetraPaks.  6 - The flavor industry is technically complex, and there is very limited competition. And IFF has something like 3000 patents (serious, it is crazy complex, scientist with crazy hair level of technical complexity.)  7 - Their dividend percent is about a percent above the industry standard (  vs    Cons:  1 - I don't know how well the merger will work.  2 - There are alot of shares coming "soon", but should still trade around the same value.  I already own 100 shares, and bought 200 Feb 19 $150 calls (because, wow, there was something like 160,000 open interest at that time point. Someone must know something, right?)

GME Can we Drive Price Up?
I've seen a lot of posts saying that the price for GME is being pushed down because they are selling back and forth to each other at lower and lower prices.   I dont know enough about any of this but if they can drive the price down by going back and forth can we not do the same amongst ourselves by selling back and forth to each other at a higher and higher rate?   I imagine not because if we put share out there to sell we dont have the option to buy specifically from one another right?  In the mean time I am holding my 42 shares @ 317 like the rest of you.
NOK is taking off Thursday whether you're in on it or not, use it to fund $GME and put the final nail in hedge fund's coffin
TLDR: NOK is gonna have such amazing earnings this Thursday that even Boomers will start buying it up in bulk, leading to a massive rise in the price of the stock. Get in now, and reinvest those sweet sweet gains into $GME. Bonus: hedgies also heavily short NOK, so it going up makes them bleed too. DO NOT SELL YOUR GME TO MAKE THIS PLAY.   GME only gets fully squeezed if there's additional capital coming in. GME doesn't get squeezed if enough people sell that the hedgies can escape. But chances are good you're either too smooth-brained or not smooth-brained enough to have all of your assets in on GME, so you've got something you can put on NOK to make some quick bucks and then reinvest to GME. The hedgies bleed when NOK goes up (less than GME but still good), and they'll bleed more when you can triple your investment in GME cause of these gains.   Remember: Robinhood wouldn't have banned buying NOK or GME if they couldn't lose their shirts on it going up.
What even is the point of selling?
I got in to stand behind a movement towards equity and to support a company that was on its way to bankruptcy. The price can hit zero. I'm not selling.   With all the paper hands being filtered out, we're left with people who will ride or die.  They can't pay me to sell these shares

You've won, there are no "evil doers" left on the other end of the trade
You've blown up Melvin, and forced ballsack chin Cohen to re-open his fund again to new investors(to cover the giant hole u tards ripped in it). You've saved two struggling companies, GME and AMC, and with it thousands of jobs and lives that depends on it.  You've made your point, the whole world is now watching you and this moment has been immortalized in history. Those Evil Boomer HFs, they've closed their shorts, but are now being replaced by new shorts. How did they manage to do that with the relatively small exchange volume ? Legally they can do it via dark-pools or going directly to the institutional longs; Illegally by counterfeiting shares. But as it stands, with the borrow rate decreasing and no significant share loan recall, there is not enough pressure to trigger large shorts covering.  Life isn't fair, move on or hold or double down, but don't let it destroy your life.  When you make a trade, you are betting on future events, nothing is set in stone. Like, you can predict with 99% certainty what you'll have for lunch tomorrow. It's the ribs at Tony's, but maybe tomorrow you get there and the cook is sick or the meat supplier van broke down, no ribs for you. It's a game of chance.  To the new comers, don't take the rhetoric and memes here too seriously. WSB has a very special magical ability to turn everyone reading it into FD loving degenerates and with it a defined cycle. Every once in a while a savant autist with genius DD appears, the security goes up 1000%, and every retard goes ALL IN and it'll eventually blow up in their faces, they post loss porn, go back to working at Wendys for a while, then after a few months reload their broker's account and return.
Latest Short Data from Ortex for GME as of 2/3/2021 and some thoughts about the GME trade, past present and future
Condolences to those degenerates who hopped on the GME train late and congrats to those who got in early and made some tendies.  Unfortunately for both parties we seemed to have missed the short squeeze opportunity of a lifetime(for now, more on this later).  You can place the blame for that squarely in Robinhood's court.  Make no mistake about it, those unbelievable fucks cost retail BILLIONS of dollars in potential tendies.  We don't have to engage in conspiratorial thinking to consider this.  Of course, it could certainly be true that Citadel leaned on them to force them to cut off retail, but the application of Hanlon's razor (         If I was a Robinhood user I would not forget this and strongly urge anyone still on that platform to pick a real broker from the list of those that didn't fuck retail on this.  You should also join one of the many class action lawsuits on this.  Even non-robinhood users should do so if you were holding GME shares or options on the critical date(1/28) as you owned an asset that was subject to market manipulation and suffered a loss. (not legal advice, not a lawyer).  As you can see from the available S3 data the 28th was also the high water mark for short interest.  After that date shorts started closing positions so a much more terrestrial amount of shares were open shorts in the following days:       Some fellow retards have raised doubts about the quality of the data from both S3 and Ortex, some going so far as to say they have colluded with the likes of citadel as well.  At present this appears to be speculative at best and most importantly lacks any compelling evidence to support that conjecture.  If anyone has something more concrete on this I'd be happy to look into it.  All this leads us to the present moment: Ortex Data as of 2/2/2021        As you can see all the numbers we should care about from a short squeeze perspective are down in a big way: Cost to borrow(vig on shorts), days to cover(how long it would take to unwind current shorts), and estimated short interest(number of open shorts).  So for now at least the squeeze seems very unlikely for the near future(that being said I'm holding 2 Feb 5 $800C just incase, to hedge upside for my Feb 12 $150P's).  Another Squeeze and lessons learned?        It certainly seems possible but I'm not particularly bullish on a short time frame a basis.  In order to reproduce the conditions that lead to this incredible run we'd need a number of things to fall back into place:  1. Retail would need to accumulate shares at a much lower price point: It was much easier for u/DeepFuckingValue to hold his GME than late comers because his cost basis was so low compared to those coming in at $100+ or even $50+ 2. Retail would also need to be on broker platforms that have fortress balance sheets so they could absorb the swings without closing off the buying spigot 3. Short interest would need to return to the stratospheric levels pre- mid-January AND those shorts would need a lower position open price (P < \~$20) so they could be overwhelmed by the initial push 4. IV would need to come back down to earth from it's currently insane 495% level for GME, this would make options cheap enough to allow buying into the gamma   effect we all saw in the initial trip to the moon  In closing I would say don't feel bad about not making it to Pluto because we at least made it to Mars and stuck a WSB flag on it's surface.  We have all changed the stock market forever. We've also  announced to the shithead hedge funds of the world that there is a new sheriff in town and they need to watch their fucking backs.  Current POS:  GME Feb 12th $150P  GME Feb 5th $800C  AMC Feb 12th $10P  Assuming this actually makes it through the automod and you retards are interested I'm thinking of posting an after action report on how I dealt with this whole GME ride.  Good luck out there you degenerates.  \ edit: various spelling and using ">" instead of "<" because I am a retarded ape, also none of this is financial advice, invest at your own risk, etc etc

Stake is experiencing some very suspicious problems at open today...
Disclaimer: I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but it certainly doesn't look good, given the behaviours of the clearing houses lately, which has forced a fair number of brokers. Also, I'm an ape and have no idea what I'm doing and not giving any advice based off my actions.    I bought in small position on GME just last week through Stake. It was a pain in the ass, but fortunately cleared funds in time and all trades are confirmed. Currently holding with diamond hands.  At open today, I open up my Stake account and find that my "Buying Power" and "Unsettled Funds" are   exactly the value of my GME position  . I panic, calm my self down and recall that I'm going to be on a rocket soon, on the way to mars with Elon Musk, so I regain my composure and immediately assume it's a bug.  I try and use it to purchase GME shares at the new low with said balance but it fails as expected.    get onto Stake's twitter account and find they post this:     Stake says only 'some' customers are affected. Let me guess, degenerates and apes with some specific stocks right. Now this can't be my shares being sold without my knowledge or approval, right...?  \                         -  EDIT: Stake provides its customers with a Limited Purpose Margin Account (LPMA), view Stake notice   advising the change from standard cash accounts.  We know Stake uses DriveWealth and even in their   it doesn't mention loans or borrowing of my shares for the purpose of others executing shorts?

On bots and bullshit
We are all aware of the massive influx of bots, and the amount of misinformation floating around is ridiculous.  I think the issue now is that we are seeing the results of the bot sentiment manipulation being taken up by users. I see some pretty well written posts where people are spreading misinformation etc. Probably because they have picked up on s\ \ \  the bots have been spreading.  I'm worried not only that this misinformation   is damaging the credibility of WSB and the movement we are all a part of (now), but that it's going to cost a lot of people, a lot of f\ \ \ ing money!  I think the proof of this manipulation can be seen here:     Look at GME:     Sentiment was high all along, even when the price was low. People were following along for the ride with DFV etc.     Now look at BB, NOK and AMC:              All of them, the sentiment lags the spike like a mofo, and it's insanely positive. These tickers were hardly even being discussed before GME kicked off. This suggests that the initial sentiment came from outside wsb and then likely people got caught up in the craziness, fueled by bots spamming these tickers to draw attention away from $GME.  And it worked. I only got in when we were at about   members so I am still new, but at that time, people were posting exactly that: "Ignore AMC, NOK and BB, it just draws focus away from the main play: GME".  Now there may be fundamental reasons why people believe in the other tickers, but I really think GME is a once in a lifetime opportunity. People are getting caught up in the hype around the others, and it is now self perpetuating. People have sunk costs in AMC. NOK and BB and are trying to hype them back up to the peaks.  All this is doing is playing into the hedgefunds hands.     Also, bonus SLV chart:     This f\ \ \ er is crazy. Look at how that flood of comments coincides almost perfectly with the peak, and now SLV is trading 10% below where it rallied.     People are losing money due to the sentiment attacks across the board.  There also seems to be a growing portion of users comparing anyone still holding $GME and talking about the blatant lies, manipulation and outright criminality of the hedge funds, to f\ \ \ ing QAnon.  Now I'm not being funny, but I think the concept of billionaire cronies trying every dirty trick in the book to screw the little guy back down into place is a FAR more credible concept than the idea that those same billionaires are all pedophiles who eat children FFS.  I'm not saying that every single cry of "short ladder attack" is correct, and that there aren't some crack pot theories going around based on reading public data sets entirely wrong and jumping to insane conclusions  BUT the pure fact is, there is some shady shit going down in plain view and we need to be aware of it and stop letting it divide us.  Having said all that, I'm just a tin-foil hat wearing smooth brain who does rainbow s\ \ \ s after eating crayons so you know, make up your own mind.  TLDR: Bots are manipulating the f\ \ \  out of sentiment here and elsewhere.  Also, as if it wasn't obvious, I'm holding 56 GME @    See you in Andromeda           edit:      Fuck, hope y'all are okay

Viacomcbs Investor day and paramount plus launch super bowl catalyst
I saw a post about VIAC and I am also long so let‚Äôs talk about it with some shit DD. First the investor day is for the entire industry not just the company, look at the Pluto tv Netflix deal and you‚Äôll see. I saw the other posts guy js on it. Narcos deal with Pluto is money. They could do other stuff with major Netflix shows and movies. Netflix deal with Pluto is huge but let‚Äôs think about the bread and butter, showtime and paramount plus rebrand are driving subscriber numbers which translate to revenue.  There are a lot of reasons to look at VIAC and I won‚Äôt break it all down but you should be thinking about this as a content pure play, it‚Äôs all about production capacity and licensing deals, I think we are looking at a legit arms race for content. Think Disney and Warner brothers except NFLX and AMZN just entered the chat.   This is an obvious trade for the investor day but I think the super bowl could be just the engine we need to take this fucker to the moon.  Before getting on the rocket ship please realize that this stock is undervalued and has significant short interest against it. Another target but I think the super bowl and investor day give such strong evidence for a catalyst research yourself and fuck the suits.

‚ÄúWhile the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could. \[‚Ä¶\] These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy, and they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do: They looked‚Äù.

More specifically:   We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!    Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of   shares by some insiders (totally normal as it‚Äôs mostly the private equity owner ‚Äì EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from   to   ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit).  Here‚Äôs the   prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021  ):      1)   Now, check out page 9 of the document    For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:      ‚Ä¢ Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million      ‚Ä¢ Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million      ‚Ä¢ Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million    Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates‚Ä¶  In fact, the company initially estimated the following ( from Q3 release     For the full year 2020, we currently expect:  ‚Ä¢ Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.  ‚Ä¢ Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.  ‚Ä¢ Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  Then, they updated the  guidance on November 30th 2020  ( :  For the full year 2020, we currently expect:    Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.   Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.   Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.    So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!      2)   But that‚Äôs not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again‚Ä¶ we just need to look).  As they mention on the Q3 report, ‚Äúas of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $  million, $  million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $  million‚Äù.  In the more recent prospectus (page 10):   In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $  million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.     This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.   As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So   this implies around 150M FCF in 2020   (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).  (check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here    At $39, Corsair has a   market cap (  of shares outstanding).  This is a very respectable cash flow yield of   I‚Äôd be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (  growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of   in Q4).  \ --  Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!  I used to be like you‚Ä¶ I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things!  No f\ \ \  way!!!  Take a look at Goldman Sachs‚Äô research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published).  Someone shared it on reddit     They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated ‚Äúguidance‚Äù (more than a guidance, it‚Äôs actually the results given how close the ranges are‚Ä¶)    TLDR  : Corsair is a great company and its results are already out!  Make your own investment decisions!

NVMI: a hidden gem with great upside potential
Mandatory pledge of allegiance to GME: I was in GME before it was cool. Did both  .  Now back to the issue at hand:  A while back while reading the comments on an $NNDM DD in here, I came across a guy who said $NVMI is even better than NNDM but he's not going to write a DD on it or promote it any other way on WSB. Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I'm sharing the results with you:  Nova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.  Metrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company's metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.  Market cap: \  Billion  P/E ratio: \~42  Has beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn't check further back)  The stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.  Daily volume is low (about 150,000)  In a recent (Jan 28, 2021)  , the company announced that it "received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions."  They don't name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?  Anyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.  The company's technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).  I did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.     Technicals:  I don't know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it's neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.     My positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021  The options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks.

Closer look at $XL
Okay guys, I know you just want to know the short interest as the trend goes so I'mma just get it out of the way:   it stands at approx. 70% of share float, have a look: (       However I wanna have a closer look at the company itself and why it could be a good investment for short/medium term gains, because that's why we are playing this game called stock market.  XL Fleet ($XL) transforms existing commercial vehicles,   small trucks into electric vehicles. Unlike many SPACs, they have an actual product that is already battle tested, and yes, it has also produced revenue. Revenue, that is set to increased   exponentially   as mentioned below. Now here are couple of interesting points that made me a believer:    $350m in cash with NO material debt   Run by MIT alumnis with CEO's impressive records at McKinsey, GM   Jon Ledecky as board member - he's the majority owner at NY Islanders and the company he founded in the 90's was the fastest entrant to Fortune 500   Two analyst recently began coverage with $30 PT. Current share price as of   is $    2024 revenue forecast is $  billion; current market cap $  ! -> company says accessible market is 1 trillion $   EBITDA positive results projected for 2022   All government vehicles to be turned electric - XL has the fastest solution to this and they've already known to have collaborated with public institutions   Other customers include   Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Verizon, DHL   PIPE shares that were unleashed in the market recently created lot of downward pressure for the stock - that should be over soon   Hyped by Cramer, gave a lot of Mad Money air time going through their business case  Price targets and analyst coverages:    BTIG initiated analyst coverage with $30 PT:       Canaccord sees XL Fleet going to $30 per share due to 'first mover' advantage:      This is not an investment advice and I recommend you all do your DD. All kinds of discussion is very welcomed, thanks am out.  EDIT: GME to the moon with diamond hands. However this should be an interesting play moving forward so keep an eye on my boys at $XL whether it's before or after GME saga is over  Edit 2: I recommend you all check the backgrounds of CEO Dimitri Kazarinoff, founder Tod Hynes and board member Jon Ledecky. These are some smart motherfuckers you wanna have on your side when growing a business in this sector

Got played at gamestop
I‚Äôll accept the downvotes. Pretend for just a sec: -that bots controlled by others, added fuel to a speculation frenzy.  -The hedge funds make us look like apes holding bananas and we embrace it. Holding those bananas all the way to the bottom.  -They lied about the S3 reports.  -They set up RH to take the fall, knowing that RH wouldn‚Äôt have the capital requirements and also knowing that their Reddit bots would target RH users -They played AMC and GME in lockstep with each other so much so that the charts are nearly identical.   For the record, I‚Äôve been successfully investing since 2005 and still got caught in this FOMO. I‚Äôll keep holding my 10 shares I bought way too high. But not because ‚Äúfuck the HFs‚Äù, that was part of the FOMO fuel. I will hold my 10 shares as a few thousand $$ lesson to my future self.  Edit: Also, if the rise from 1mil to 7-8mil WSB subs in the span of a few weeks isn‚Äôt enough to at least raise your suspicions of the validity of WSB posts now, then you might have a clogged BS detector.

SSYS - Stratasys flying under the radar
Oraight, time for some deep dive.  You all heard about that Kathie Wood, sister to Tiger Woods and Woodie Woodpecker. ARKK (her investment firm), identified TSLA early as a potentially exponential company. Ever since the TSLA stock split, I have been going through ARKKs ETF exposure and been looking into further firms that have an angle.  I have been looking into three areas of ARKK:    EV   Genomics   Technological Advancements  While the first two are clear and there should be some exposure to it in your portfolios or bets, I was specifically interested in the third category.    Introducing Stratasys SSYS    The company has quite a solid foundation. It is one of the leading 3D-printing companies. Makerbot? The biggest brand in 3D Printing? Yep, Stratasys. I come from a background where 3D printing has become the absolute industry standard and we are going to see it becoming the standard in mass manufacture, too. I am speaking metal and carbon 3d-printing. Let me tell you, carbon printing is already better than part molding and every company on earth is starting to use it. I am talking car manufacturers, shipyards, small-scale prototypers, the cycling industry, the airplane industry, everyone. With SSYS you aren't jumping on a company that sells shovels during the gold rush. Your jumping on the company that gives everyone the chance to build their own damn shovel. Taking the bet on SSYS is not a "Next Friday" moment, you are rather looking into a growth over time chance. The beauty of this badger is: the current evaluation is under 3 billion.  The sad thing? You are too late. It is trading ~~near the ATH~~ at the highest level of the last 5 years. But hear me out, the real kicker is if you look at the charts. After the last earnings, there wasn't much movement. But then, during the overexposre of ARKK through TSLAs growth, someone has been buying in tranches day after day for nearly 2 months now. My theory is, institutional investors are starting to copy ARKKs investment strategy, loading up on different companies ARKK has been invested in. So yes this baby will fly higher because as far as I see it, there hasn't been much exposure to the retail world yet.        Why it will go up:    Solid economics (200+k revenue per employee)   Overall growth in the next 2Y will continue   Exposure to exponential growth potential in 3D printing   Low overall market cap (sub 3bn)   Linear purchases over the last 2 months, seemingly larger investor with stepped investing strategy   Not speculative: They have products, they are generating revenue, the fundamentals are working   Perfectly in place at the right time   No high volatility, IV is superfine if you are into calls   Connected to other hypes: 3D Printing for EVs, Medical, and others.   Covid situation independent, except for 3rd world war scenarios  The risks:    ~~Trading too ATH, triggering additional capitalisation~~ (See edit, its trading its highest in the last 5Y but about 1/3 of its ATH. The risk therefore is more something like: 5 Year High could trigger additional capitalisation)   Competition getting too good, driving revenue down (unlikely)   Some early investor dropping out   ARKK reducing their exposure or killing of SSYS publicly    Edit:   Thanks to /u/YahyaJ - SSYS is nowhere near its ATH. ATH was at 136, were now at 49.    Where I see it flying    I think SSYS is going to steadily grow more and more accelerated. This steady growth will not stay under the radar, especially not when retail starts to look at the different investments ARKK is exposed to. I think within the next three months it will add another 30-40% through institutional investors and ETFs cloning ARKK. If you look at their exposure chart, ARKK even had to reduce their amount of SSYS for it to stabilise it's % in the ETF:  . This runup has been to mechanical to ignore, inspite of it trading to ~~ATH~~ the highest level of the last 5 years.  I don't think its ready for a retail investor runup, aka: its not going to pop. But it is going to steadily climb, which should give a nice return on calls and stock. If it goes down in value (which it did during the covid dip), it will still be a valuable company that will one day pop off. There is no real bagholding exposure at this price level. You are investing in a technology that   will   rule the world and in a company that is ready to take the scepter. Options are a significant risk though.    The rest    I do not yet have a position, except for a few stocks I bought to track the stock (lul) and they made about 120% since november (damn). I will take a bigger one soon and will post my update here.  For options: Watch. the. spread!  Whats the WSB take?    EDIT for Transparency:   Started taking some bigger exposure and bought 6 calls 50 March 5, will take more as soon as funds come back to settled cash from the clearinghouse

GameStop ($GME) hires new c-suite and executive talents (2/3/21)
GameStop issued a   today.  They've hired a new CTO, who is a former AWS Engineering lead and held senior positions at QVC and Zulily.  He will oversee new ecommerce engineering and operations.  They've hired a new VP of Fulfillment who previously worked at Amazon, Walmart and QVC.  Lastly, they've hired a new VP of Customer Care, who previously worked at Chewy.  Customer Care was always Chewy's angle at being successful overall, and it's good to see that customer care talent being incorporated into the new GameStop.  This looks to be the start of the whole new ecommerce strategy.

Remember why you bought and not a loss unless u sell
I got to put this out there: A. Its not a loss until you sell, keep this in mind. Every trade is psychological as much as it is on DD. If you keep seeing it as a loss then your confidence and biases will be fuk up. This will affect your decisions moving forward.  B. By now you should have backed your buys in cash since most brokers have upped margin to 100%. This means your risk of margin call is nil. If you have confidence in your buys then leave it.  C. There is no interest and expiration dates on share ownership, unlike shorts which need to pay daily interest on their positions.  D. Finally trust why you made the buy call and cut out noise from outside which make you uncertain.   E. Know what is worst case scenario, and how long will you be in the game for. Remember its not how to time to market but time on the market. DFV was in for over 1 year.  Disclaimer: i got 8 at $189 average and am holding.    ü§ö ü™ê

A message to the Short Bus
THANK YOU! Like seriously thank you so fucking much for driving the share price down. Individual GME investors can double up their positions for much cheaper. The new Netflix movie will have a much more interesting plot now too.  I couldn't really recommend GME to my non investing friends because at 2-300 it was overvalued. But at 90? You best believe I'm getting all the homies into the game now. Because GME could be a growth / value play at these prices. Albeit a growth/value play with a hefty premium. But I don't think my friends will mind. They like watching you squirm just as much as I do!  You hedgies should do your research before spamming the subreddit with bots and getting your shills in the media to bash the members of this community. Do you know who we are? Do you know what we do? I've been on this sub for the better part of a decade now. Our investment tool of choice is 0DTE options! We eat volatility for breakfast and shit it out by noon. We YOLO into far riskier bets than this.  In my tenure as a proud Theta Gang ambassador I've seen many a millionaire minted in these hallowed halls of ours. I've seen people iron hand (the OG   ) calls during the Coronavirus crash, and puts during the coronavirus recovery. We have a risk tolerance your puny manipulative brains couldn't even fucking comprehend.  I've seen the lads here make and lose money at rates I didn't even think were possible before joining this sub. (Shout out to u/1R0NYMAN ) You hedgies think you're hot shit because you went to an elitist school and have a lot of capital backing you up. Well I'm here to tell you, the only thing more dangerous than an enemy with unlimited resources is an enemy with nothing to lose. WSB is about the risky bets that either win big or lose big. That's what we're fucking all about. At 3-400 per share you had us in our comfort zone. At 90 per share you're basically begging us to fuck you.  It costs us exactly ‚Ä¶ (the Square Root of Jack fucking shit) to hold. It costs you millions to keep your retarded bets open. You guys are supposed to be the smartest guys in the room how'd you play into our hands so fucking easily? Like god damn this is some "I'm going to dump my life savings into gourd futures" levels of autism.  Like you retards realize that by executing short ladders we can just eat up liquidity even faster right?  By eating up liquidity the swings up and down will be even more massive.   Individual   investors are buying in from North America, from South America, from Europe, from Asia, from Africa!  Honestly it's just a matter of time until an arctic researcher drops a few bucks in to complete the set.  You tried to pull a fast one on us but ended up shooting yourselves in the leg to do so.  We'll outlast you.  This doesn't happen for weeks? No worries   This doesn't happen for months? No fucking worries   This doesn't happen for years? (Thanks for saving us a bunch on taxes!) Again   NO FUCKING WORRIES    We've cornered you. It's buy or die. (Buy  and  Die for some of you retarded fucks lmfao) Buy our shares or die to fees and your clients leaving.  The first one of you hedgie fucks that closes out your short position is going to close for the least amount of money. There are bag holders even on Wall Street. WSB is a "community", can you really say the same for your wall street buddies? Sure they'll help out in a pinch but they'll leave you out to dry in a heartbeat if it no longer becomes worth it. There's a reason they say " There are no friends on Wall Street ".  Thanks for the free money. I'll be buying more shares (5 figures worth) when Schwab clears my deposit.   Disclosure: I am not a financial advisor and nothing that I say should be construed as financial advice.    Disclosure #2: Every time I say 'we' or 'our' or 'us' it is out of convenience or shared community. All investment choices made in the subreddit are made by individuals who act of their own accord. I nor anyone else in this community has the right to 'speak' for this community as a whole. All     opinions     expressed in this post are mine and mine alone.   Not an edit just a note: Internet stickers are cool and all but I'd rather you spend that money on $GME or to just give it to charity. Covid hit a lot of people hard and they need money more than reddit does.  PS: Mods give me a flair god damn it. I didn't really care when the sub was small but now that we're north of 8 million members I feel a bit left out. A good flair and I'll give ya a little something something in the alley behind Wendy's.

CRSR Is The Play Before 2/9 Earnings
Positions: Long my entire IRA in CRSR $45 2/19 calls; Short $35 2/19 puts for my entire Roth IRA. (Fuck taxes we scheming here)  Corsair is poised to have it‚Äôs biggest quarter ever. How do I know? Check MSFT and LOGI earnings. MSFT sold out of every xbox it had. That is absolutely ridiculous. Corsair has rolled out new products, and every neckbeard in this sub is buying their PC cooling systems.  Last quarter, CRSR doubled expected EPS amidst a run from $20-$51. CRSR has been consolidating for months between mid 30s and low 40s, with a break out last week touching $50 before the market slide. They priced a secondary offering from an insider lock up at $35, providing a strong floor (thus my short puts at $35. Shout out theta gang.) 80% of the float is locked up til March, short interest is fairly high, and Corsair should have its best quarter ever.   Finally, the technicals. Pull up the chart, consolidating tighter and tighter everyday for weeks. It‚Äôs about to explode. Don‚Äôt miss the big play this week.

Market manipulation at its finest. GME and AMC with almost the exact same movement
AMC to The Moon
Both GME and AMC have suffered enormous losses yesterday due to Hedge Funds and the Media's Manipulation. Remember we are in this together and dont fall for the media and HF. Just take a look at the gme premarket.        Gme seems to be the big focus for HF and Media because what it has done already, but buy if you want to. AMC is a buy now, and even if it goes down dont sell. Its not a loss unless you sell it at a loss. Just hold and buy, hold and buy. AMC is will eventually go back up due to COVID and theaters opening up again, so AMC is a safe buy.

The short ratio as % of total volume has remained high. They likely haven't been covering the last 5 trading days.
I went back over the past month of short sales data and you can see that GME is still being shorted at fairly healthy levels. Anything over 50% in short ratio means they couldn't have covered overall for the day because a majority of the trades were shorts (math, people). Also, this data is showing only   short   sale data; it doesn't include regular share sales.  If someone could overlay this with the volume / price chart, it'd be helpful to see what that looks like.  Source:   but this is a good daily representation of the number of short trades.

Signal over noise
Here is the signal I am receiving through all the craziness and noise. As a hedge fund manager, what is worse than losing 20 billion dollars? Just think. My thought is losing MORE than 20 billion dollars or losing power (pretty much the same thing) This battle is about power, if they lose what could the ripple effects through financial system be? If they win how many more billions of dollars are going to pour into their funds after they demonstrate their "overwhelming power"  How many  of these guys do you think actually understand the technology of the dynamic companies that are changing the world and carring us to the future? The kinds of companies AFK ETFs are invested in? They don't, they just understand how to win a game that where they can change the rules if they start losing. This is what they stand to lose. They know no other way. What if they are fined, criminal charges, jail, blah blah blah blah, none of those thing are worse than losing 20 billion dollars or even more so, power. "When you play the game of thrones you either win or you die" So I ask you a question open for discussion, from a hedge funds position what exist in the world that is worse than losing this battle?  Edit:losing  I'm an engineer I can't spell for shit

How hedgies can use synthetic longs to make it appear they‚Äôve covered and it‚Äôs
3000 minute read for most of you. This might explain why there are some super tarded OTM calls on the options chain, other than just tards being tards.   TLDR - squeeze not squoze, fuckery to make you sell. Real longs    bears r fuk.   Copied from Tradesmith. Author: Justice Clark Litle. I removed some words to prevent auto mod  Over the past few days, the level of hedge fund short interest in GameStop fell sharply. Or did it?  On the evening of Monday, Feb. 1, Bloomberg reported that ‚ÄúGameStop Short Interest Plunges in Sign Traders Are Covering.‚Äù  Two separate research firms, IHS Markit and S3 Partners, reported the drop:  ‚ÄúShort interest in the video-game retailer plummeted to 39% of free-floating shares, from 114% in mid-January, according to IHS Markit Ltd. data. Data from S3 Partners, another market intelligence firm, showed a similar pattern, with GameStop‚Äôs short sales having fallen to about 50% of its total stock available to trade, down from a high of roughly 140% reached earlier this year.‚Äù  The reporting coincided with a big drop in the value of GME shares. This is clear evidence that the hedge funds are winning, and that the Reddit army is losing.  Unless the short interest data is being manipulated, which is also a real possibility.  If the   Congress does any real digging when it holds hearings on the GameStop situation, it will uncover some very interesting quirks of the market, many of them revolving around shorting practices.  Most people understand ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù to be an illegal thing, and it is ‚Äî sort of.  On the other hand, there are plenty of instances where naked shorting is more of a gray area ‚Äî not so much a violation of the law as a minor infraction worthy of a parking ticket ‚Äî and other instances where certain players can short a stock beyond 100% of the float, or short nakedly, in a wholly legal way.  This is where the reported sharp decline in GameStop (GME) short interest gets intriguing.  There are at least two plausible explanations for GME short interest declining ‚Äî giving the appearance of hedge funds covering more than half their shorts ‚Äî even as the GME share price fell sharply alongside.  The first explanation is that GME squeezers lost their discipline and broke ranks.  If a critical mass of holders on the long side of GME started selling to realize profit in GME, that would have given the hedge funds an opportunity to cover their shorts ‚Äî via buying back their shares ‚Äî at progressively lower levels as the share price fell.  Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out.  The notion that the squeezers broke ranks, and that the hedge funds are winning, is certainly the perception that was created. The Bloomberg article strongly suggested that the Reddit army has lost.  ‚ÄúShort squeezes can only last as long as there is a large short position in a stock,‚Äù the chief market strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúOnce that dissipates, the situation changes completely.‚Äù  But there is another possibility, which is that the hedge fund short interest in GME didn‚Äôt really dissipate.  If the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time.  That is because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.   In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short ‚Äî with tens of billions of dollars on the line ‚Äî could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.  The trick would be: ‚ÄúMake it look like we‚Äôve covered our shorts when we really haven‚Äôt (because we can‚Äôt), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.‚Äù  The way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery in the options market.  The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.  The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù You can read it here via the SEC website.  The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:  If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades. A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously buy shares against the call options. The shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade. This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades. As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge. The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund. It gets very complicated, very fast.  But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they‚Äôve covered their shorts ‚Äî even if they haven‚Äôt truly covered, and can‚Äôt, for lack of available float ‚Äî by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.  Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:  ‚ÄúTrader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.‚Äù  In plain language, ‚ÄúTrader A‚Äù in SEC parlance could intentionally be giving the appearance of closing their illegal short position ‚Äî when in reality they have no intention of doing so (or no ability to do so).  Under normal circumstances, tricks like these were used to help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren‚Äôt supposed to have because the shares were never properly located.  The GameStop squeeze is a unique scenario, however, because it is a very public fight to the finish between the Reddit army and the hedge funds that are short. Either the Reddit army wins and the hedge funds pay four-digit prices ($1,000 or more) to cover their shorts because of margin calls, or the hedge funds win and the GME share price falls back to the low double-digits.  In a battle like that, with public coverage influencing both sides, perception is a weapon. As such, if the hedge funds can generate the appearance of having covered most of their shorts, while driving down the GME share price through aggressive selling on low volume (something known as a ‚Äúshort ladder attack‚Äù), then the hedge funds increase their odds of breaking the squeeze ‚Äî in part because media outlets will report things like ‚ÄúGameStop Short Interest Plunges‚Äù without looking deeper.  To be clear, it is also possible the first scenario is true.  GameStop shares may have fallen precipitously, with hedge fund short interest falling alongside, because a critical mass of long GME holders simply lost faith and tried to sell before the squeeze was complete.   But it makes a lot of sense to question that narrative, given the wide array of deceptive tricks that some hedge funds (certainly not all of them, or even most of them) have used to perpetuate questionable or even illegal shorting tactics for a very long time.  And again, these tricks are so pervasive and old, the SEC wrote a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo about them in 2013.  As such, whether the drop in GameStop short interest was real or smoke and mirrors, the fact that changes in the level of short interest can be faked ‚Äî with hedge funds making it look like they have closed out, but haven‚Äôt ‚Äî is a serious compliance loophole that should be forcefully addressed.  As a side note, the answer to this problem likely resides in the (removed)  Apart from market maker privileges, the three big reasons hedge funds can play games with short positions ‚Äî delayed reporting requirements, time windows of days (or even weeks in some cases) for trades to settle, and related transactions being executed in different places, or with different counterparties, for the sake of deception ‚Äî could all be answered with a (removed)-based settling and clearing system where transactions are noted instantly and made visible to all parties (plus the SEC).
VIAC AND MSOS MY PICKS FOR THE YEAR
VIAC and MSOS my picks of the year  Two fantastic picks to look at for February and 2021  VIAC and MSOS details on calls below. Positions listed below but I have calls and equity on both 2-26 3-19 calls 45-60 on VIAC and 2-19 calls 42-50 MSOS  see details below.   ViacomCBS investor day will price the stock far above current valuations based on Pluto Tv Paramount plus and showtime. This will be one of the most significant Investor events in 2021 on pair with the Disney investor event in December. The VIAC trade is based in many factors including the growth of free streaming globally and production capacity. Look at the trends coming from Netflix and Amazon who both look at Viac for content production capacity. Pluto TV just signed a major content deal with Netflix for narcos I expect to see more from this as NFLX chase towards profits. Before discounting VIAC look at Pluto Tv.   Next we have my favorite US pure cannabis ETF which focuses on the big four stocks and sold off big Today. This will print money an     after the second week in February when the cannabis stocks all beat earnings. More people Smoked weed in the last month of 2020 than any month before. Facts. This will translate to the ETF across the board and I alread the took advantage today and bought the equity and the calls see below.    Long VIAC calls around 2-24 because of the investor day.  Long the equity and the calls. Strike dates 2-26 3-5 3-19 strike prices 50, 55 ,60 coverage all over both dates and prices for near maximum upside.   US pure cannabis ETF is one of the best plays around with the industry set to explode over the next 5 years and legalization in the next 2 years    Also long MSOS calls and equity because of the big surge in cannabis demand and how it translates to the stocks. 2-19 calls for MSOS 44 45 46 47 48 49 50  Coverage all over 2-19 strike date with a healthy variety of prices.

APE SUMMARY WHAT CHANGED SINCE FRIDAY AND WHAT NOT. NO CALL FOR ACTION. NO CRAZY STUFF. JUST DATA SUMMARY. (=NO DELETE?)
I'm one of the new apes. Good at counting bananas. Not so god at knowing the big game BUT FOR THE MOON MISSION,  IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SHORT INTEREST/SHORT SHARES AND DAYS TO COVER; referring posts (I could refer more):        TL;DR: WHEN THE SHORTS CLOSING AT A LOW PRICE THEY NEED TO BUY BACK, RESULTING IN THE ACTUAL MOON SQUEEZE IS WHAT THEY SAYING.     WHAT CHANGED SINCE FRIDAY HERE AND WHAT NOT I AM ASKING MYSELF. SO LETS COUNT BANANAS:  I checked daily the       On Friday (market closed) we had:   SHORT INTEREST    68,13M   SHARES SHORT       97,685%  DAY TO COVER         6,31     Right now  February 3, 2021 we have the following data:  SHORT INTEREST    61,78M <   --  DOWN 6,35M  SHARES SHORT       88,58% <      DOWN 9,105%  DAY TO COVER         2,81     <      DOWN 3,5 Days     You may now say that the values haven't changed that much, or in a reasonable way and still GME is rank #1 worldwide for the most amount of %Share Shorts AND still have 2,81 Days to cover the shorts.  BUT I FEEL A LOT OF APES ARE TELLING THIS THING IS OVER AND THE SQUEEZE ALREADY HAPPENED. NOTHING MORE. BYE FOLKS? LETS GO BACK TO NFLIX?!  You want to tell me those hedgies will delete all their positions without buying back and we have a boring tearful week without anything really happening to the price anymore? Hoping they get at least a big big sue from all apes combined (which will probably wont happen either).

I am sick and fucking tired of the gamestop retailer FUD. The US is not in some magical fucking digital age. Read on for some actual retarded fundamentals.
A quick note: I am autistic, and proper references to census data are too fucking hard when most of this shit is really obvious and logical to me, so go buy some chicken nuggets to make yourself feel better about being overweight because i do  I will, however, endeavour to find sources on equitable internet access. I cannot provide screenshots of facebook groups due to privacy, but there are various groups easy to access such as global educator collective etc.  or use your tendies to buy switches for hospitals. Relevant.  There's 330 million people in the us, maybe less now because of Covid.  I'm a member of multiple teacher groups, as I was interested in how people are adapting to online learning. Here's the thing. THEY HAVE TRIED AND ITS REALLY HARD. And the reason is simple: a huge buttfuckton of the students, the people, have shitty internet access, no internet access, or live in some feudal comcast net neutrality repealed fucknut kingdom.  A real quick search of one group I'm in shows that for one district in michigan, they have 50% of the student body without ANY internet access. Yeah, digital age coming along for those people.  Why do you people keep raving about the digital age when so many people don't have an internet connection strong enough to download an IOS update in less than 5 hours, let alone a COD update.  Those people aren't living in big cities, but rural centres. Still, their internet is almost as good as mine, in Australia.        Most of the people here -have- privileged internet access. But I bet my fucking balls there's more than a few people here who have average, or poor internet. Some issue with their biller.  What does't cost internet? Physical shit. And in a place like the US where I'm sure there are people in lower SES communities afraid of doing a craigslist buy for a secondhand disk because they might get robbed, fleeced or shot, there's a huge market for a middleman who at least won't disappear of craigslist after you find out the game is scratched or broken.  That also doesn't include how a huge proportion of gamers are now women, and who don't have the male privilege of not viewing everything as a potential attack, especially given the virality of #metoo in the last 10 years.        So, just how many potential customers, or rather, nearly guaranteed customers (because poor people buy shit to make them happy to distract them from being poor, or for social capital ( .  More than a few people have boasted about using funds gained to buy things they need, or to donate things like a switch or ten to a hospital. Because we all know that when life really fucking sucks if you've got a video game you can play then you are able to at least escape, just for a bit. I'm gonna play super metroid after this.  What does all of this spell? It spells that half the reason that people are betting against gamestop is because a bunch of old people, due to their own privilege and inability to understand the social economics of why and how people play video games, have failed to understand that regardless of gamestop's need to pivot to the lucrative metropolitan market, that until there is ubiquitous internet access for ALL americans, Gamestop has a VALUABLE place in the market as a safe place for pixel purveyors to do business.  As the reply to the reply, yes amazon is a big online retailer and makes big money because people who like convenience also shop there. True. But also good luck returning what you bought from amazon, and good luck selling shit on there, it's not ebay, and inaccessible for the average punter.  In sum of my short, poorly referenced sociology post,  FUCKING BUY GME and HOLD IT LIKE ITS YOUR LAST WANK BEFORE NO NUT NOVEMBER  This is also not financial or legal advice. This is just logic.     Sources on internet access: remember, your US averages are heavily skewed by population centres like san francisco, silicon valley, new york etc.

Attack on Wall St: Worst Girl
Someone is playing with our bananas.
Viac and Pluto Tv get aboard the rocket ship
Positions: VIAC calls 2/12 56c  2/19 55c 2/26 50c 3/5 55c 3/19 55c   Look at the Pluto TV acquisition from VIAC and you see the winner winner chicken dinner, WS is betting on the wrong streaming play with Netflix, look at the future of streaming and subscription fatigue. Pluto TV is the cure. There has been a lot of press and DD but no one is paying attention, investor day is 23 days away. After 2-24 no one will doubt the future of streaming and the fast partnership with Netflix and narcos proves it. I don‚Äôt think NFLX is a bad play. I did last year and was wrong but if you look at their current path to profitability it intersects hard with Pluto tv and Viacomcbs production capacity for streaming additional content.   from the library licensing deals to the possibility of a new Chapelle show on Netflix owned in part by viac as part of a big deal with Dave to the Pluto TV Narcos deal cited in the last earnings call we can see a huge leap forward for streaming overall based entirely on the NFLX VIAC relationship. Monetization is a long term process for some of these pieces of big content and after a period of time it will no longer add new subs like narcos.   But Pluto Tv can help with ad based monetization and no sub or sign in required. If you look at the overall package we see  that more shows could follow like ozark or maybe a sopranos channel for syndication like monetization a&e tried with no cursing but fuck that shit.   If you missed the point don‚Äôt feel bad your like most of Wall Street today. VIAC is value in plain sight and it‚Äôs a growth stock in a hyper growth sector. We won‚Äôt see another streaming opportunity like this. After investor day on 2-24 the world will realize what has been silently growing for years. This is a huge opportunity and I‚Äôve posted my positions before but I will again.   Positions: VIAC calls 2/12 56c  2/19 55c 2/26 50c 3/5 55c 3/19 55c
Sharks arrive at the GameStop party: Morning Brief
Don't be a bitch
The lying is infuriating, this time Reuters
GME:
Theory: What if we, WSB/retail, push the issue and call our brokerages to demand copies of our share certificates? It's a bit old school and there may be fees involved, but if we can demand proof of ownership of our shares, or proof that brokerages cannot provide proof of ownership, wouldn't that place the onus on the people who oversold the stock?  There may be fees involved to submit the request for stock certificates, but the upfront cost of authenticity may be worth the potential gains of exposing counterfeit shares and having a legal leg to stand on forcing a buyback from the institutions that ~~oversold short and~~ are failing to deliver. Triggering the greatest squeeze the world has seen.    Please proof my logic:    Shares were sold/issued by GME to investors/institutions.  Institutions took those shares and placed bets against them.  Other institutions took those bets and resold them to other firms.  Other firms traded those bets all the way down to the retailer.  I want proof that the share I own is a legitimate GME backed share.  I go to the broker and say, show me where my shares came from.  The broker says, here are your stock certificate ID's.  If the hypothesis that retail owns more of the available float is true, then brokers will be unable to provide CUSID's on the shares issued.   They will have to go back to who they bought the shares from and say, "I need to see ownership of these shares."  The institution they purchased the shares from will have to provide proof, "These are the shares we sold you."   This traceability should be able to go all the way back to GME for verification, but if someone somewhere along the way produced counterfeit shares, this will identify who the culprit is. Then we have a fighting chance.  Edit: @ u/mcuban - One more question, please
Merriam-Webster knows what‚Äôs up. The quislings have been weeded out.    together!!!

Why the GME shortsqueeze hasn't happened yet DATA
MODS KEEP THIS UP! listen up you apes  :  - Short restrictions from today: ftp://  - Ladder attacks (temporary?) stopped:   - 86% buyers, 14% sellers according to T212 - Fidelity buy/sell ratio 3:1  -   - Massive cumulative Fails to Deliver of shares:   - They had till yesterday EOD to cover the positions from the options expiring last friday @325. If they did not buy, they are forced into auto buying today - Lots of money transfers clearing today - Paper hands have been shaken out, especially around 100 usd stop limits - 800 calls bought for ~22Million - Restrictions (partially) lifted at RobinHood, Tradeup, Revolut - S3 stating this is costing Hedgefunds even more than it is costing us AND it can be the start of the SECOND/REAL SQUEEZE if we buy in:   - short interest still ridiculous ~120% - Why all the FUD, short ladder attacks, fake silver squeeze etc. if they are not in danger? - Short positions cost 50% interest new positions vary between 16%-20%   IT IS FAR FROM OVER, GET READY FOR THE REAL SQUEEZE  EDIT: Additionally, S3 data showed a   float before open on Monday and now a   float. THE HEDGIES ARE NOT COVERING. They think that it will stay low and are not worried about covering. We need to use this as a buy and hold opportunity to push the same momentum that drove things on Tuesday.   ALSO: FINRA requires firms to report short interest positions in all customer and proprietary accounts in all equity securities twice a month. Look here:   Note how they usually submit the first short interest report of the month on the 14th/15th and the second is usually 28-30th. They still haven't posted for January!   They are essentially still fucked and that's why they delay.

I am very grateful for the people here that spend a lot of time posting their dd on the current option and short interest situation. You are giving people faith in times when our Ape-hairs are turning gray or just fall out. However, I feel urged to remind you of your situation: - can you cope with your entire position going tits up (   - case basically but needs to be taken into account) - if you have a major position in $GME, do you have a clear case for what is supposed to come? - Does your dd rely on objective data-sets or rather emotional bias? We are all prone to confirmation bias. Thats why I browse the sub so frequently  One final take: try to avoid margin as it restricts your freedom and might force you to    at the worst situation due to a margin call. If you are in it with your life savings you dont have to double down with money you dont own. Otherwise you might as well sell your kidney...  Anyways I am riding this to Valhalla fellow apes

GameStop Update 5: The Unpopular Truth
In the most recent update in the GameStop Saga GME has crashed from $450 per share to around $90 per share with a 50%+ crash yesterday.  Here is Why:  The GameStop Short/Gamma Squeeze worked because we had 3 things on our side  1. Surprise: We were underestimated in the capital we could bring to the table 2. Focus: A huge focus of our readers was on a single Stonk 3. Momentum: Fast growing crowd and upswing.  However in the past few days we lost all 3.  1. Surprise: The surprise was clearly gone, the second the news started reporting on us. This is theoretically ok as losing the element of surprise could be replaced by an increase in both focus and momentum. This was especially important because of the volume of short interest initially. 2. Focus: Our bets went from a laser focus on a $200m GME to a spread out focus into AMC, NOK, Etc. This was when we needed the focus the most, as GME's market cap rose over $20 Billion 3. Momentum: This was literally stopped dead in its tracks the second that the brokerages pulled our ability to purchase more shares. This is not something that we could have expected, it was a fundamental shift in the rules of the game, but it happened.  This is not to say GME won't or can't go to the moon, this is to say that in order for GME to move forward there would need to be a different set of elements that would need to come together.  You are welcome to hate on the post, disagree with my logic or just not agree with I am saying. But, for this and future plays I think it is important for people to be thoughtful of what caused the run up and where we are today.  I'm not saying to buy or sell GME, but this is where I believe things stand.

Great job sticking it to Wall St!
Ya'll need to read this:    >And while we‚Äôll leave the motivations of those who think a short squeeze is actually a political revolution for another newsletter to tackle, it‚Äôs clear these investing Goliaths took notice of what‚Äôs gone in markets of late. And these sharks arrived to take their cut of the spoils.  >Bloomberg‚Äôs Katherine Burton and Katherine Doherty reported on Tuesday that hedge fund Mudrick Capital booked a profit of around $200 million on positions in both GameStop and AMC Entertainment (AMC). Mudrick, which has about $3 billion under management, returned just under 10% in January according to Bloomberg, marking one of its best months since inception.  >Late last week, we learned that investment firm Silver Lake had made about $113 million after converting $600 million worth of debt in AMC to equity and then selling the entire position during the massive surge in the stock price.  And..  >That hedge funds are both cashing in on these meme trades and seeing market dislocations as an opportunity shows the challenge that lies ahead for retail traders. More attention on what Redditors are buying, selling, or short squeezing makes life harder for a retail investor base that benefitted from being ignored by mainstream Wall Street investors.   Outstanding job holding the bag.

Schwab DD part 2 - Next Multi Bagger - Daily Trade Growth 100 % from last quarter and Q1 2021 Earnings Beat
Daily Average Trade Growth    $SCHW just release its daily average trade summary for January 2021.  It has seen daily average trade growth from   million in October all the way to 10.3million by the end of January.  This number will continue to increase as retail investors growth continues to boom and upset traders on Etoro, Robinhood, Webull and Interactive broker flee to Vangaurd/Fidelity/TD/Schwab the few companies who didn't restrict trading.       Revenue Sensitivity (daily average trades)    Taken directly from their winter business update which was released online yesterday.     Calculating revenue growth just on the daily average trades we can see that they will be experience increased revenues this quarter of:  10,326 - 6,543 (average daily trades for all last quarter) = 3,782/ 100 \  60M =   Billion increase in revenues just as a result of increased daily trades. This is assuming the 10,326 daily trades stays flat for the rest of the quarter. I expect the daily trades to continue to rise as a result of increased retailer activity and market trend. Lets say   Billion increase as a result of retail investor growth.  To put this in perspective they reported   Billion in revenue in Q4 last quarter. If they are to report   Billion plus this stock will jump 30%+ next earnings. Combined with cost savings with the TD merger Net income will see a increase of over 50% from last quarter sending this to $80-100 after next earnings report.    Margin Balances:    Schwab had to restrict the use of margin balances on select stocks during the January boom as retail investors started to opt to use margin to increase their holdings and risk. Margin usage has seen a drastic increase per their Q4 statements and I expect Q1 to follow suit with continued growth.          Part 1 DD Summary:      Average Daily users:   20% increase from the October 2020 numbers to December 2020 alone. The January numbers will even be substantially higher with TD Ameritrade and Schwab both reporting network strain due to the influx of new investors signing up last week to get into GME/AMC/BB. This trend wont be stopping anytime soon, the retail investor's strength is gaining. Just look at Wallstreetbets alone we had   million members as of Monday and now we are sitting at 7 million.    Future/Longevity of Brokerages:    Etoro, Webull and RH will be facing lawsuites and scrutiny as a result of their trade restrictions. Do you want your money sitting in a brokerage with possible liquidly issues as a result of lawsuites.    Balance Sheet Strength:    Schwab has the strongest balance sheet of any brokerage on the market. With Trillions of dollars under management. This means that they will not need to restrict purchasing power of shares when there are substantial new deposits.    Quote directly from Mark Cuban's AMA:    When you load back up, fight a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on their balance sheet. Someone that can be there when the fight starts and wont blink an eye.    GME and AMC Round 2    For any future short squeeze traders will need to transfer their accounts to Schwab/TD/Fidelity to make sure their are no trade restrictions and bullshit manipulation. Schwab/TD and Fidelity are the only brokerages who have strong enough balance sheets to support future potential squeezes.    Monthly Activity Report    Schwab releases monthly activity report 2 weeks after the most recent month. This report will summarize daily trade growth, new deposits, new brokerage accounts. This report is expected in the next 2 weeks. Most likely on the 15th. $SCHW will explode similar to what IBKR did this week when these results are issued. This is your chance to get in cheap with $SCHW trading at 15% of its high and 25% off its recent price targets which were issued prior to this retail growth frenzy.    TLDR:   Schwab is undervalued thanks to market sell off and will fly come February 15th when January activity report is released. It will run back to its ATH's in the mid 60s thanks to new customer deposits/transfers from shit brokerages and daily trade growth.  I expected Schwab to report revenue of   plus this quarter or a 50% increase from prior quarter with net income increasing 50-100% as a result of the TD merger cost synergies. This stock will be trading at over $100 come earnings in April  Calls are cheap.  You can find part 1 of DD here:    Position:  February 19 $60 Call to play the monthly activity report being released February 15th.

AMC and GME threshold Security List
Found this on Investopedia  "Although the list does not specify the cause of the failed settlements, it does provide regulators with a starting point from which to research the source of the failures. Meanwhile, the NYSE has its own threshold list,   which as of March 27, 2020, includes a number of stocks, including AMC Entertainment (AMC), GameStop (GME),   and Blue Apron Holdings (APRN)"  Also went to NYSE website and checked threshold securities list for myself.  Yup.  Gamestop is still there.  As this ape understands it, per investopedia, this could be a starting point to see if there was market manipulation or short selling (but it could be due to human error instead).   Big meeting Thursday with Yellen etc.   Anyone smarter than me know how something could continue to be on the list for possibly months and there was no investigation?

GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys
TLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk   store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.  I am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.    Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo    I think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.  You know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land.   Note: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.    Microsoft revenue sharing    GME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?    PC building kiosk    Know microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk   store. Now imagine this:  \- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently  \- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get  . Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.  \-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.    Conclusion    GME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.  Position GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.  What about the squeeze?
Sir Mix-a-Lot said it best...
"I'm   long  , I'm   strong  , and I'm   down to get the friction on  "  There's been a lot of posts lately about needing another rally, about "tomorrow's the day", and where's the positivity?  Those first couple of weeks was a hell of a ride and it's not over yet. I've got a smoother brain than most and barely understand all of the analysis that I see on here, but these hedgies have been controlling this game for a long time. It's going to take more than 3-4 weeks to bend them to our will.   Where's the positivity? How about this... Fuck you! Are you a toddler who needs to be entertained 24/7? Make a plan a fucking stick to it.  We need another rally! How about this... Fuck you too! Okay it couldn't hurt, but, y'all, the amount of awareness we have all brought to this situation is   incredible  . My boomer parents are talking about it. They're asking me about what's going on! That's so huge.   Don't give up now because all of the excitement is starting to fade. This is when the test begins! If you haven't studied or prepared for the test, then get the fuck out.  Look, I work in education and don't have YOLO money like you all, but I'M IN THIS TO THE END!    Positions   GME   @ $  BB 20 @ $

GME super awesome megathread weds 2/3
TODAY IT'S NOT (NECESSARILY) THE BIG DAY
If you were expecting a well built and informed post, go elsewhere.  All I can say is that in the past days they've been trying to do EVERYTHING they could in order to make you sell, and it wouldn't surprise me if they'd try to do build up your hopes to then crush them down just like they did to $GME in the last week.  One good thing to do if you decided to HOLD: for every post saying "tomorrow is the big day" expect to hold at least one day more.   Set your upwards stock variation notifications to an higher value than actual $GME price, and take some time to relax.  They want you to feel stressed, they want you to shit your pants, and now is the time to believe in what you thought when you decided to buy.   You should have known they weren't going to go down so easily.  This is exactly the part where they're proving that: they're powerful, very powerful, and no weak ass    bitches will ever hurt them in any way.  In the moment you bought, you decided to fight. Now it's the part where you have to do the fighting.  If you can't afford to lose this fight, you should use your brain and take a decision, if you really believe in your past week's plans, then what happened in the last few days probably shouldn't really mean anything to you.  Don't forget many of us are not here just to make money, we're here to change a rigged game, and if you thought clicking a few buttons on your phone would have been enough to win, you were obviously wrong.  It is in our possible losses the hope to build a better future for who's to come. Change comes with a sacrifice.  Those who stand by those beliefs will never lose.  I really am not a financial advisor nor a financial expert, I'm barely an enthusiast. I'm retarded for sure.      See you in hell, or on the moon.   üîó
I emailed a journalist to let him know that WSB is NOT buying silver. His response? He joined the community! Welcome retard, can we make this a trend? Let's open people's eyes to hats really going on. GME
Here's his article    My email to him.  Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere   members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way.  Hope you have nice day, all the best.  Yours, Jordan.     I really appreciate that your email address is on your article because even if I don't get a reply it makes you seem very easy to contact... A feature not shared with a lot of journalists. So thank you!   His response:   jordan  Thanks for your email. I want to report the truth as accurate as possible. So your email helps me clarify what is really going on. I did join the site over the weekend.  Gary Wagner  Let's send journalists some love and welcome them because we need all the help we can get against MSM

Lurker in WSB for more than a year. It aint much, but diamond handing from Singapore too! BUY WHILE GME IS ON SALE GUYS
Why $GME is gonna rise.
It's not rocket science.  Robinhood's imposed buy limits coincide perfectly with $GME's stock plummeting.  If the demand for stock is: buying it > selling it, it rises.  If it's selling it > buying it, it plummets. And $GME is plummeting because of Robinhood's buying restrictions.  The only hurdle right now is Robinhood's decision to limit $GME share purchases. But everyone is either against or on that case ( .  As long as you don't sell your shares, the sky-fucking-high demand for $GME right NOW is gonna skyrocket its prices‚Äîit's garnering worldwide attention.  So hold, even if it's one share.        Edit (Feb 4, 15:19 GMT) : The logic definitely is over simplified, but I wanted to be short and to the point. Couching my point with a bunch of esoteric financial terms is only gonna obscure what I'm trying to say. Robinhood definitely isn't the only reason the share prices are plummeting. I may have come off that way. I acknowledge that plenty of other brokers have placed purchase restrictions as well. I only  mention Robinhood because they're arguably the biggest source of demand for $GME.
CTS Eventim announces mandatory vaccination for concerts in Germany. Go short!
CTS Eventim announces mandatory vaccination for concerts in Germany. The company plans to separate people into vaccinated and unvaccinated and only grant access to concerts to those who have been vaccinated.           As people dislike this discrimination there is already an angry shitstorm on social media in Germany. Many who have kept their concert tickets to wait for an alternative date are now returning them out of indignation and want to boycott the company in the future.  Maybe there is a possibility to earn money through actions on the stock exchange due to this fact and on the other hand to harm the company to the maximum.  Definitely a good opportunity to "short" the shares if you have the chance.  EventimWKN: 547030   ISIN: DE0005470306      I am curious about your ideas.

Gotta break your own balls for what you believe in.
It ain‚Äôt much but here‚Äôs my donation to the cause. I call it a donation because I don‚Äôt expect to get the money back. Because I am NEVER GONNA SELL!
The main takeaway from away this is not to hold to fuck hedgefunds, it‚Äôs not a battle between the rich and the poor and it‚Äôs not about how the system is rigged.
The main takeaway is to NOT invest money you are not ready to lose.  I saw many many people here yesterday saying they invested their tuition money, their life savings, their house payments and, overall, money they could not lose.  I‚Äôve been in this sub when it was 2m and I‚Äôve seen astounding gains and terrible losses. Never posted because I never could afford to own a stock or to put money I was willing to lose.  With this @GME, I thought that maybe it was time to try and ‚Äòplay‚Äô with the stock market, so I dug up $100 bucks I had laying around and bought some fractional shares at @418.  I‚Äôm down 70%ish but my mind could not have been better. I literally don‚Äôt care if I lose this money as that was my mentality going into this.  Like the rest of you retarded apes, I‚Äôm holding forever.  PLEASE, i‚Äôm not a financial advisor but merely a human one, DO NOT put money that you are not absolutely ready to lose.  Lastly, see you on the moon  üåï  Edit:   Retarded version and TL;DR as a bonus.    ‚ùå üíµ  can‚Äôt loseüòé  Not a loss if you  üèª       üåï

PSA: Enjoy The Fucking Ride
PSA to the 7+ million new members trying to navigate to tendietown by reading posts on this sub:  The most reliable DD just less than a year ago, coming off the heels of a 80 VIX, on whether to buy calls or puts was based on whether someones pet gecko ate a worm the night before. Or, someones dog (who apparently drank bleach based on the grass it killed every place it pissed), and whether it would take a shit on the left or right side of his lawn demarcated by a line of tape across it. The TA is best inverted, while the shitposts like "my friend who is UPS delivery driver says it is the busiest it has ever been so I'm YOLOing into calls for earnings" somehow print.  Yes, there are a plenty of autists here pretending to be retards, but most are retards pretending to be autists and their bravery to YOLO away their student loans sustains erections worldwide from the glorious loss porn, and they are honored for their sacrifice. The few that hit a big lick get a "congrats and go fuck yourself, be sure to post again when you lose those gains"  If you take it too serious you are risking too much. If you find yourself asking questions or advice on trading, 9/10 times the most accurate reply you will get will be "$ROPE"  If you want to build stable long term wealth from the market, it is easy but very slow - but this sub is not that. This is the casino where options either print or expire worthless.   The point is, enjoy the ride - win or lose. If you can't do that you're doing it wrong.
Just bought for 16k dollars. Am I stupid or smart?
Why did I ever bother?
Adding $BBBY under $30 per share to your Short Squeeze Arsenal is a crazy smart play right now.
My Ape brain went in for 37 shares of $BBBY (Bed Bath & Beyond) last Wednesday at $38 a share (along with 12 $AMCs at $16 &   $GMEs at $324 [HOLDING]) And today I went to dump the $BBBY shares, but after looking into it, $BBBY under $30 is the best bet for a short squeeze play on the market right now, because even if the squeeze doesn‚Äôt happen, the stock will gain value.  Reading this you will learn:  1. $BBBY has a constant uptrend  2. $BBBY has staying power  3. $BBBY‚Äôs uptrend will continue through the Summer and possibly Fall  4. $BBBY stock will not only give you a Short Squeeze opportunity, But is has long value of 10% in 6 months over its current price    AT ITS CURRENT PRICE $BBBY HAS LONG TREND VALUE (EVEN AT 6 MONTHS). During this Cycle (which I‚Äôm starting after the Covid correction in March) $BBBY has had a fairly constant Uptrend that, even after the first January correction, has a trend that still lines up with the troughs on the higher-low line:     $BBBY is a healthy company, but so called ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô thinks there is going to be a downturn in home goods when the Covid stuff ends. Buying home goods during the Stay-at-Home orders is what they call ‚ÄúNesting.‚Äù which is why so many of them shorted the stock, but $BBBY will be fine for at least the next 6 months, or even 9 months. We‚Äôre not going to be leaving our houses for the next few months anyways, which will continue the ‚ÄúNesting‚Äù trend for another good quarter or two, and it will take investors a few down quarters to start frowning on $BBBY. So that means current investors are HOLDING. That brings the trend price based on the higher-low line to about $33 in July, 10%+ where the current stock price is at:     NOW HERE‚ÄôS THE BEST PART: Most Apes on here who pay attention know that this stock is shorted by 65%. Here‚Äôs a list if you‚Äôre new:     Of all the companies on this list, $BBBY is the only one with a very healthy trend line compared to it‚Äôs current stock price. Even at a stock price between $25-$30, which is above $BBBY‚Äôs current ‚ÄòHigher-Low‚Äô trend line, in 5 months $BBBY will be worth $33. There is still a 10% growth there. A LOT OF RETAIL AND INSTUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE HIP TO THIS, AND THEY LIKE THE STOCK, SO THEY ARE HOLDING!   If another GME Sort-Squeeze is going to go KABOOM on another stock, its probably going to happen to $BBBY and soon. The last settlement date for shorts was on Friday with 51 Million shares, but have 11 days to cover. The Next settlement date, Monday, February 14th,   million shares have only 5 days to cover. On February 28th, 64 million shares will need to be settled with only 5 days to cover.     If $BBBY is a healthy stock that has a current price under $30 and a long price of $33 for July 2021 (10%+ its current value), it‚Äôs being shorted at 62%, retail and intuitional investors are holding, and 126million+ shares are going to have to be settled by the end of February‚Ä¶.   Here‚Äôs my observations on why Bed Bath & Beyond $BBBY stock is going to be healthy for a long time. I call them the ‚ÄúDoubles‚Äù:   DOUBLE THE AMOUNT GATHERINGS AT OTHER PEOPLE‚ÄôS HOMES IN 2021! ‚ÄúHedge Fund‚Äù belief is that when the pandemic is over there is going to be a mad desire for larger than life gatherings like Concerts and such. That is true, but there‚Äôs going to be long   up period for that. However, a year full of missed birthday parties, anniversary parties, retirement parties, youth sport team parties, divorce parties, dessert and   parties (these are actually pretty fun. I don‚Äôt drink btw, I go for the deserts), cookout for the hell of it parties, etc‚Ä¶ are going to happen at an accelerated Rate in 2021. Did you know Bed Bath & Beyond sells party supplies? I‚Äôm not talking about just paper plates and napkins; I‚Äôm talking about serving platters, serving utensils, electric food warming trays, beverage tubs, margarita machines, kegerators, bathroom towels, random stuff to make your house look nicer when guests come over‚Ä¶ all the stuff someone would want for a party. People don‚Äôt have time to wait for an online order to show up when they‚Äôre preparing for a party, especially if they need those items the day of. So they go to the store to get it when they think about it.   DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF EXTENDED STAYS AT FAMILY AND FRIEND‚ÄôS HOMES! Long distance family and friends haven‚Äôt seen each other IN PERSON for a long time and reunions are going to be #1 on peoples travel list. Couch surfing and guest rooms are going to be the top destination for most people in 2021. Smart Money thinks there are a ton people out there with the money spend on Cruises and trips to Disneyland? Hogwash! People are going to be visiting their family ‚ÄúBack Home‚Äù or traveling to Boston so their 4-year-old daughter can meet her cousins in person. And the hosts for these guest roomers and couch surfers are going to update their hospitality amenities (such as clean sheets, towels, toothbrush holders). Many of them wont have time to wait for an online delivery; they‚Äôre going to need those items NOW. And where will they update guest hospitality items right now? BED BATH AND BEYOND!   DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF WEDDING REGISTRYS! All the weddings that got canceled last year are going to happen this year. Plus all the weddings that are supposed to happen this year are also going to happen this year. And do you know what is attached to all those damn Wedding Invitations? A Wedding Registry! And where are all of them registered at? BED BATH & BEYOND! May-August going to be Diamond Hands for them. Here‚Äôs a great vomit-inducing article about the increase in weddings in 2021 & 2022 because people like links in these DDs:     DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF STUFF FOR COLLEGE DORM ROOMS! A ton of new college kids didn‚Äôt move into their dorms last year which means double the tonnage of new college kid will be moving in this year. And those college kids are going to need sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, shower caddys,  , etc‚Ä¶ And Mom is going to want to shop with their kid to buy that stuff together. Andy where are they going to shop for that? BED BATH & BEYOND   WORK FROM HOME IS HERE TO STAY! Sure, you might say people already stocked up home stuff during the lockdown and that buying binge is over. ITS NOT OVER ‚ÄìITS NOW HERE TO STAY! And when you get squirrely stuck at home with nothing to do, sometime you go out and buy stuff for your home. Its like: ‚ÄúYou know what I need? A new coffeemaker. Lets go get one right now.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúRemember how so and so‚Äôs dishes all matched each other, lets go get some matching dishes right now.‚Äù When squirrely hits, you aren‚Äôt going to wait around for an online delivery, you‚Äôre going to go get it NOW.    $BBBY is a good stock. The company is liquid, there is a need for their goods, and they offer convenience for immediate purchases. Plus, lots of people and companies already own the stock with no intention of selling. Its financial stability, firm upward trend, and staying power already have it as a HOLD or LONG by 4 out of 5 reporting agencies, which is what conservative money looks at. Bed Bath & Beyond is already reported to have a good quarterly report coming next week, plus all the variables I laid out are going to continue the company‚Äôs positive earnings for the year.   Oh yea, some Key company factors:  1. As per their last report they got $  billion in the bank. They‚Äôre Liquid  2. 15 million have downloaded their store app  3.   million new online customers last year  4. Other important financials that IDK what they‚Äôre about  5. They dumped all their subsidiaries and now just focus on one thing, Convenient Home Goods! Here is a link to the dummy version of the last report (it has pictures!):
Ironic I bought at Friday night movie prices when I always went to AMC before noon to get the cheap ticket.
You should leave this sub and sell your stock if....
1. You don't know how a stock works or what it represents. (No lessons here, unsub and go find out.) 2. You have short term needs that will be disrupted when GME doesn't  , bills, crack addiction, etc) 3. You are a gambler. You don't need this place. Go away. 4. You got here when GME was $150+, heard about us on cnbc or facebook, or you think we are your friends. It's best you leave now. 5. You are a blogger, activist, or reporter. We are here to make retarted bets on retarted stock  with retarted money. Only retards will remain by next week. That is not a badge of honor btw, thats still an insult here. Autistic is different though, and I haven't seen a single autist here in a week+.  6. You think by speaking like a retard, will like you. "Me fuk bear" type shit. Fuck off. 7. You think this is political. Its not.  8. You keep checking here for when to sell and have no idea where or how to read company data and determine it for yourself.  9. You are angry and looking for someone to blame for losing a sure thing. You made an uneducated choice and I'm guessing 1-8 applies to you.  10. If you've been here for a while. The mods did amazingly well, but the wave of stupidity is not quite over. Each time this sub goes through this kinda change, a lot of crap gets pulled in and it's gonna be hard to differentiate that from true DD in a while. Retards need to lose some money, celebrities need to go back to their expensive social holes, and the autists who made money need time to get antsy and start trading and posting again. Take your teddies, get 100 shares of tesla and go take a shower. It's clearly been a while...
Delivered by   . First stock I ever bought, and I'm still holding. I wish I had more money back then.
I heard you retards are into stock market    üèª
Never felt happier about taking a loss like I‚Äôm feeling today! I‚Äôm riding that bitch down to 0, buying more AMC and jumping on the GME train today. Suppress the pain  Apes. Later you will enjoy the gain    together we are Strong. Can I hear a ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù?

IM A RETARD I DON'T UNDERSTAND, NO SELL, NO FEAR, ONLY HOLD
Pre-market looks good!
Holding!!! GME will rise again
The misinformation   continues
The Rocket Ship is Almost Ready Degens!
Why you should hold. Opportunity still exists.  Long read 10 Min  Realistic outlook.
Im holding shares of GME at a average price of $56, my view may be biased but I tried to look at all evidence and not be.   I know a lot of you are looking for confirmation that you should still hold, the truth is that may or may not be in your best interest. Only you can decide will all the information you have what‚Äôs best. Don‚Äôt listen to random people online.  However I‚Äôm going to let you know why I‚Äôm still holding. I bought in with a average price of $56 and a lot of the shares bought below $100 will be held by people who haven‚Äôt sold yet and aren‚Äôt planning on. Institutions and smart investors with a good amount of shares ( 200+ ) are currently holding, mostly paper hands (people who jumped on because of media/word of mouth) are gone now and they most likely didn‚Äôt have a big amount of shares anyway. We also temporarily lost swing traders because of the restrictions and loss of momentum, people with big balances who seen big dips as swinging opportunities ( $124 to $300 for example ) yes they sell but when they buy it brings pressure back and the price up which brings confidence for other people to invest in. I still think SI is high and HF aren‚Äôt out the game yet. With how high the SI is and the low float I think we would have seen a lot more volume on Wednesday/Thursday/Friday. The whole world was buying so this kind of volume to me even if it was HF unloading dosent signal them unwinding.    So what‚Äôs the game plan?   Well firstly I think the HF couldn‚Äôt have let the whole world buy shares and have a short squeeze, they would be in to much debt and the price may very well have gone past $2000 due to a massive amount of people buying ( people normally not involved in stocks ) and the HF would of become insolvent. What I think the HF did is allow retail to buy during the week with Melvin unwinding their position, then once retail buying pressure starts to decrease due to people already in the stock, start to coordinate together with other HFs to restrict buying on some brokers ( decrease buying pressure ) and slow down the momentum caused by the internet and people talking about the squeeze. They would then let people sell and induce FUD which changed the narrative and worked, the price is now at a more comfortable level for them $90. On the 09/02/21 we will see latest SI ( 2 weeks ago date ) and I‚Äôm assuming it will still be over 100%. They will try to bring price as low as they can but there will be a people with large amount of shares bought early they won‚Äôt fold ( some can‚Äôt sell ). When good earnings come out and in addition to Cohen turning the company around and increasing the valuation until fair price is $100.   Then we may see the HFs unwind and the short squeeze would happen, at a much lower price for them as to not have to buy back shares at $500+ also with less people involved ( retail got bored/lost too much money and isn‚Äôt financially involved with GME ) there will be less competition to buy shares. They don‚Äôt want the whole world‚Äôs eyes on them during the squeeze. This is a waiting game for institutions and smart money. If you have the money and time to hold it would be smart or to make a position at there‚Äôs prices would also be smart. We wait for Cohen to turn the company around which would tell everyone who‚Äôs shorting this company that it will be fair valued at $100 and they ( shorts ) would not be able to bankrupt the company or get the share price back to where they or originally shorted it.  TL;DR - HF still have to initiate MOASS. Not yet though people need to hold for Cohen to take action and creat a positive outlook for the company, HF wouldn‚Äôt want to pay interest on a company whose valuation will be going up for years. They would unwind.   Here‚Äôs some emojis for you retarded apes ü¶ß  ü™ê
DD: Why GME Valuation is valid at $300+?
The 2020 pandemic year and onward has been the year of insane valuations. Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.     For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \  outstanding shares (not just float shares).     GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \    shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.     Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.     According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is   with the retail sector overall at   Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping   valuation with an annual consensus of $  EPS. Source:  .     Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$  was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$  The consensus for the year is -$  But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.         Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $  - $  per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here.          What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,  whereas the current auto industry PE is   Toyota is   Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year -  , but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.     Note: I'm long GME @ $325.

Why invest in Vaxart Inc. (VXRT)
I expect today Phase 1 results before Vaxart speaks in the early afternoon (ET).  The results must have been known since mit December and substantial parts of the results already in November! Remember the last person for phase 1 was recruited in November and primary completion of the study in early December !  And again - phase 1 is an open label study (no blinding for anybody !). Vaxart knows the data the very moment when their laboratory machines give their results (  neutralising antibody titers from an ELISA Test)  Vaxart must know the results since many weeks.  Why does it take so long? Phase 1 is a relatively small study. The reason is the talks which are behind the scene. While we get Hamster results, I am confident that Vaxart had several meetings with OWS and WHO COVAX committee talking about large multi hundred million dose production.  It is only consistent that Vaxart is hiring so many highly qualified and well paid staff as indicated on their website: all prepared for large scale production. Contractor is secured as well. All is set.  I would not even exclude that we may not get phase 1 results today before the conference if anything is still to be negotiated between Vaxart and OWS or Vaxart and WHO. This could even further delay the announcement.  It is also possible that we first get phase 1 results today before the NY Academie of science meeting and then followed in some days by OWS and/or WHO announcement.  In any case if we do not get news Premarket - this would be indicative that something very big goes on behind the scene. But zero doubt that the phase 1 data would disappoint. Keep this stock, it may change the fate of this pandemic but also your financial being
Stock also can go up 20% in 10 minutes!

DD for $AB
Before I begin this DD, no this is not the next GME. There is not a next GME. That's not a thing, so stop saying it is. Okay, with that out of the way here we go:  Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because  A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And  B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.  After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:  1. He liked the high dividend yield of   and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR 2. He knows something I don't.  So, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.  EDIT: This is entirely speculative and could be high risk. I'm retarded so I don't know if it's high risk or not. Invest at your own risk. (for the new members of this sub)
DOWN BUT NOT OUT! Diamond hands fellow retards, diamond hands.

Still going strong in germany. Me and my ape friends will hold and buy at dips.
Buy the fucking dip
I'm a hodler, so this is not my biggest one night loss. Aside from this total losses are about 50K including 12k loss before I fell in love with the cause/memes and reversed my position.
You only lose if you sell - Buy the dip
A relevant film: Inside Job
I know a lot of us are watching relevant films right now, there's been a lot of talk of folks giving The Big Short a rewatch; I know plenty have likely already seen it but thought I'd throw a recommendation for the Inside Job out there for anyone looking for a bit of emotional fuel for this whole thing.   Just gave it a watch with my wife last night and it's a really great documentary about which elements contributed to the 2008 crash narrated by Matt Damon and really gave me a lot of perspective into how corrupt things have always been. I know a lot of the information about the events is widely known already but there's definitely a lot of nuggets of gold in there that I wasn't aware of until now and has definitely helped ignite a further passion to hold on to my cut in this tii the end.
My friends and I are 13-17 years old and are part of a video game club at our school. We go to Gamestop all the time at our local mall and want the company to succeed and we believe in its future. We love Gamestop. So all of us put all our savings and bought GME stock.
Hello everyone, here are some messages that a friend of mine (in the US, we don't even have a GameStop here XD)  wants to send to you all but his account is a bit too new so I'm posting it on his behalf:  "My friends and I are 13-17 years old and are part of a video game club at our school. We go to Gamestop all the time at our local mall and want the company to succeed and we believe in its future. We love Gamestop. So all of us put all our savings and bought GME stock. We are NOT selling. We will HOLD.   We also convince all our parents and friends to buy GME and AMC tomorrow.           "        Update Position: My friend said he bought under his parents name. Here's proof.

Is this even a free market anymore?
I ask every freedom loving person of this world to ask this. With brokers limiting and even restricting your ability to buy specific stocks, do we even have a free market anymore? When your ONLY option is to sell, what does that do to the psychology of the person holding? On top of that you have the media blasting falsehoods 24/7 and now "realists" coming in droves to WSB to say "I told you so".   When you hit the sell button, you are perpetuating the plutocracy we find ourselves in today. As my favorite person in the world would say, "Not today buddy, Not today"
Asking to officially join WSB. I've lurked for awhile, joined the sub shortly before the hype, YOLOed GME for no reason other than some rocket emojis. I hope my lossporn is a good enough sacrificial lamb of membership. Still holding.
New day, new battle
Today is another day, they've been beating us down for almost a week now, stopping us doing so much, has that stopped us holding? Na did it fuck, we've held through everything, let's carry on and see where today takes us, maybe today is the day we can win this battle.  Keep your heads up, it's not a loss if you dont sell, we can still get this squeeze, if you are new here and haven't seen the Volkswagen squeeze in '08 check it out, we could very possibly be on the dip before lift off       If you are doubting GME and find yourself watching the ticker and have your finger over that sell button, put your phone down, watch some TV, go for a walk, talk to your wifes boyfriend and ride this low. Good luck today fellow autists.   (this isn't financial advice, I'm just a retard that likes the stock)  ü§ö ü§ö ü§ö ü§ö
All I see is FUD
After a horrible day yesterday, and all the paperhanded bitches selling, I understand why people are upset.  However this is what they want you to think.  The bottom line is, they want our shares, don't give them to the hedges.  All I see is "Have they won?" "Is the squeeze still going to happen?"  The facts haven't changed.  What we saw yesterday was a short ladder attack (You can see the volume)  The buy sell ratio is 80% 20%  They are bleeding out their arses in interest  They need our shares  This has become a psychological war  Dont let them win  VW was in the red for 4 days before the squeeze  Everyone hold on, let's ride this roller-coaster  Im not a financial adviser, I just like the stock
THE DIRECTION OF THIS RALLY
Where is the direction of our rally going?  Listen up, it's late as hell and I want to get this off my mind.   There's been many comments and posts saying to get off this journey before you loose too much. Yes, I agree - get out if you're on the verge of eviction and need to pay your fucking rent to survive.   But we're drifting off a clear direction. Yes, we're all looking to profit and take some tendies home. But the fact that DFV didn't sell everything proves that the direction of this movement has changed. It's not all about profits anymore. It's about exposing the game we're playing and the rules set.   Sure we can play the same game for years and follow advice from r/stocks or r/investing and take our 10% yearly profits. But this isn't what this fucking sub was about.   !!THIS SUB HAS NEVER BEEN A SOURCE FOR FINANCIAL ADVICE!!  Millions of new people joined this sub and thought everyone's becoming a millionaire but never saw a loss porn in their life til recently.   So let's take a step back and see what we've accomplished and what we can accomplish further.  We've disrupted the media, Wall Street, and even politics. What did we find out? That there's so many behind the door rules that we don't know about.   When Elon asked Vlad what the formula is that determines the cost of the Clearinghouse operates, the Robinhood CEO doesn't have a clear answer. He just states that the people behind those doors are good guys and that volatility is a big role. He goes out to defend them but doesn't explain clearly the rules of the game as to how the numbers add up. Take it from an engineer, if 1+1 is not 2, that bridge is held by fucking twigs and will collapse during the next 100year flood.   Now what about the logic behind shorts decreasing from over 100% to 50%? The price of the stock kept going down from weird transactions with the trading volume so low.   It doesn't make sense. And we need an explanation. We're playing a numbers game where the rules are set by people that are keeping the rules from the Public. And with that, how the hell can the normal working person live a life with financial freedom??   We the people are large enough to seek an answer. It's time the people behind closed doors stop controlling the rules they set to keep themselves comfortable while risking our daily livelihoods. Their actions affect us too much and we need to find a way to separate from their chokehold.   Sure you can listen to "logic" and cash out. It might benefit you personally.   As to those remaining in the fight, we need answers. We need to know what's going on behind those closed doors. It's time the game stops and the power goes back to the people.

GME: Calm the Fuck Down
Let me start this by saying that I have GME and I‚Äôm holding. I very much want it to go back up and I think it will. But it‚Äôs going to take a while.   Stop with the posts that say ‚Äúthe last time it went to $112, it then jumped to  ‚Äù. Even if that were true: so what? You can‚Äôt use past behavior to predict what is going to happen, especially here in this particular case and especially when that past history is a week ago.   Also, stop with the magical TA posts. It‚Äôs great that you have crayons, but drawing random lines doesn‚Äôt mean the stock is going to follow the pattern you think you see. Especially in a period of high volatility.  The short squeeze may not even happen (or maybe it did and fizzled, though I don‚Äôt think so). There‚Äôs no law that says it must. It won‚Äôt happen unless there‚Äôs a reason shorts have to sell en masse.  I get it, confirmation of your biases feels good. But living your life that way is begging for disappointment.   For posters: would you post your predictions if it meant a permanent ban if your prediction was wrong?  For readers: do you think posters would post their optimistic predictions if it meant risking a permanent ban from the sub?  Calm down. It could still get very bloody and if you‚Äôre holding, you might have to do so for a long time.   Positions: 700 GME shares
Melvin's Master Plan   5 Steps until Kaboom üí•
Melvin made this plan during the weekend:  1. Get a   from my bois Citadel and Point72. 2. Hire PR firm to publish articles on   on Tuesday.   Divide & Conquer WSB  . Flood their boards! Use their weapons against themselves. 3.   at opening on Tuesday to short more GME, including put options. 4.    5. Lick WSB tears üò≠ (buy GME lollipop at $10 of the crying babies)   "Bunch of retard short-term traders. We will not let our vital company go bankrupt! Flood their message boards!!"   TLDR: Melvin is adding more shorts and puts. They expect GME at $10.  TLDR: I can almost smell the lemon juice üçã!  TLDR: Official short numbers February 9th  T L D fkin R!   GME to the GdamnMoon!
Why did the big players exit their positions on GME if this is supposed to mooooon?
I'm still in as all great retards are, but my brain is bouncing around in a marshmallow head wondering why if the big players like chamath etc. Sold their positions if this is going to moon? Just didnt, doesn't and won't make sense unless we do moon. I've become more and more skeptical over the last few days but I loaded up the etoro account with another ¬£500 of hard earnt cash to buy more... Just in case we do moon, I'm totally expecting to lose it all though and be left with some gme shares for the people's!  Price target $
THEY FUDGED THE SHORT CALCULATION. THEYRE DESPERATE. HOLD
How to Trigger Short Squeeze
HFs are driving down the price by 40-50% because of the low float, guess what, we can do the same as long as we all buy an average of 1-2 to shares in the same day. We can potentially cause the entire situation to blow up. Imagine a situation where at least half the sub buys at least one stock in the same day guess what happens the couple of hundred of shares in the short ladder attack don't matter anymore and due to the low float we could easily see a price increase of over 200% in a single day which will inevitably cause some paper hand shorts to cover causing the short squeeze    TLDR; Buying on low float can easily cause GME to double or triple in a single day causing Short squeeze    EDIT 3: I will post proof when I buy at market open.  EDIT4: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED AS SUCH, I ALSO DO NOT CONDONE THE COORDINATED PURCHASE OF ANY STOCK OR EQUITY.  EDIT5: to all the people spreading the FUD worst case scenario price drops another 50% and we buy the dip and wait till the shorts die a slow death by interest either way we win in the end just as our ancestors used persistence hunting to catch their prey we will use persistence buying and holding to hunt for our tendies  EDIT6: Yes I'm strapped for cash if my net worth was liquid enough I'd go all in and blow up the Shorts with a couple thousand shares and see if that does anything.  EDIT7: Just bought over 100 shares @ 100    EDIT8: took out some parts for legal reasons so repeat after me "THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED AS SUCH, I ALSO DO NOT CONDONE THE COORDINATED PURCHASE OF ANY STOCK OR EQUITY."

German News say‚Äòs that the GME hype is over! üôèüèº
üß† Loop de Loop predicted. GME to infinity.
deliver the morning news and  ü§ñcatch the plague.
The intention of this post is not to suggest a price target, nor predict the future direction of $GME (     ) but to instead address some of the fear that spread through the public yesterday and made the  panic.  There were many   who delivered the morning   route directly onto the lawns of those who scripted the headlines the night before. The question is though,  how many   ? How many  delivered  to the Hedge Fund's while they strolled out onto the front lawn of their mansions in their Ugg boots, sipping their freshly brewed covfefe.   How much of the trading volume was     and how much was   ü§ñ?  I'm just your average  . My thumb is barely opposable. Luckily, yahoo finance allows you to navigate its site by simply licking the keys. After a couple short circuits resulting from my overly fluid salivary glands, I stumbled upon the following trading data. This isn't no technical shit, I can only count to 10. Luckily for me that is all that I need.  Below you will see the Open, High, Low and Close for the past few weeks. Now, I'm no wrinkle brain but I see a lot of 0's for us dumb  who randomly mash 'buy at market'. Only  ü§ñwho are whipped into line by their evil overlords have the mental capacity to target numbers such as 0 with such precision:      "But you just drew triangles around numbers with red crayon?"  you might hear yourself ask. Well you're wrong. They're fucking rectangles. Retarded  aside, coincidentally, there are lots of red rectangles over the previous week of trading. This to me, highlights when our good pal  ü§ñcame to visit.  From Jan 26th till 28th, the crayon is only scribbled over the daily 'High'. Is this from  ü§ñscrambling to buy back shares in an illiquid,   sell depth? Maybe. Maybe   just had limit sells because they like taking  while   not looking.  The more interesting part is that 7 out of 9 price points over the last three days have  ü§ñfingerprints on them. To put this in perspective, the next  ü§ñ00's not in this picture isn't until Jan 4th, and the next is on Dec 11th. Not many  ü§ñ00's. This is more than coincidence.  Now we all know the  ü§ñhave powered up and SkyNet is coming for us, but the questions remains;  Were there enough     to allow the shorts to exit?  or was it mostly just  ü§ñplaying Ring Around the Rosie and passing plague ridden tissues to each other while the foundations of Melvin and Citadel start to crumble.  If it was the latter, then the  ü§ñare going to have to work extra hard now that we only have    and  is fuelling for launch.  Positions: 60$GME @ $128 average.  TLDR: Lots of  ü§ñvolume. If  ü§ñ>   then  üåï.
Good morning you ignorant apes. Of course Janet Yellen will speak about her fondness of WSB in a press conference with the SEC and leaders from major hedge funds later this week.
Motivation Wednesday $GME [My diary notes] [Remember the loyal soldiers who standed besides King Leonides. This is us, the diamond hands, standing our ground next to the King DFV]
Day three of the second week of the fight.  Dear diary,  Last week we had seen some shit in the market. Brokers shut down the American free market for some time. The whole world talked about us at first, but then the attacks began.  We were marked as market manipulators. However, we had support. By millionaires, billionaires and politicians. Soon we weren‚Äôt market manipulators anymore, but people who saved businesses.  However, the HF were smart. They had a crisis meeting and changed the narrative. They took positions in SLV and then called their friend at the news outlets. They changed the narrative from a GME squeeze to a silver squeeze. The whole day everybody on mainstream media talked about fucking SLV. But we kept strong, we fought the fake news with facts until they stopped talking about it. During this attack we lost some men who switched to SLV.  However, then Friday came. The HF started their short ladder attacks. At first we did not recognize these attacks. We didn‚Äôt know how to defend ourselves, then to stay together, buy the dips and shut our eyes from the reds. A lot of options were in the call and it costed them millions.  The HF called all their quants this weekend. They picked some PhD students from Harvard, Stanford and Oxford and made their plans. They did the math, analysed WSB and then knew what to do:  WSB grew from   million to   million in a week. Most of these people are not retarded enough to hold the stocks if they lose 5%. So lets continue the short ladder attacks and let them fear the big money.   And that‚Äôs what happened on Monday. They regrouped and started the attack‚Ä¶ We lost a lot of apes on Monday. Then the second attack on Tuesday. I must say, I almost cried. A lot of people left the fight. They told their wife‚Äôs boyfriends that he will become a millionaire, but lost a couple of hundreds, so they left the fight. At the end of the day there were only a couple of diamond handed people left. Moral is low. On twitter we called for our Daddy Ryan Cohen, however, no response‚Ä¶  But then the post of u/DFV. After topping an unrealized return of 48 million, he lost approximately half during this weeks fight. He came with his post and showed us that he will continue the fight with or without us. The most loyal to DFV and GME are staying now. Me too. DFV showed me how to become rich, he gave me a taste, something I never had. Now, I will stay until the end.  This reminds me of the fight of the 300 Spartans against the Persians. During the first fights everybody stayed and fought successfully. But then when King Leonidas wanted to continue for freedom and respect, a majority of his soldiers left. Only the most loyal and strong stayed. This is us now in this moment. The loyal and strong Spartans are the Diamond Hands. Our king is DFV and our fight is against the strong HF. We might die, but that does not matter. Because in the end we showed them our strength and saved GME.  BTW Mods, maybe make a motivation flair?  Edit:              Edit 2: For the fucking retarded apes who didn't watch this masterpiece movie.        The captain got hurt during the fight. He retreated with his paperhands fighters. It took a while, but he told the story of the dapper and mightly King Leonidas and his diamond hand soldiers. He came back with the greatest and largest army yet and defeated the Persians.   Yes wait, our captain is Ryan. He will come to help us. He wouldnt just meme some on twitter and leave us alone.

Another Perspective for GME
This truly is a long play (I know, obviously ‚Äî but want to write it out for people worried or on the fence). I think GME didn‚Äôt issue more shares at the inflated prices because it would have angered retail and risked even the slightest thought of GME also being a bad guy ‚Äî given the intense amount of people on the hype train and the Twitter storms etc. It also would have given institutions a legit reason to drive price down.  I think Ryan Cohen and crew are waiting for this to die down, lose media attention, and let the price bottom out and consolidate before they continue to announce things. I also don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll do a share offering until a couple of quarters from now (when price has risen steadily but big). The more I think about this, the more I think it‚Äôll end up like TSLA. I think GME is about to have a stellar year or next two years, while squeezing shorts to <10% gradually. Shorts also won‚Äôt give up until GME starts putting up consecutive, big earnings numbers and milestones; just like Tesla did.   I believe Ryan Cohen will turn this company around. He is proud (and rightfully so) of how he built Chewy and is clearly a success-driven leader. I am sure he is already getting excited to come out of this as the hero (just like Elon).   A few popular DD‚Äôs were posted about this but last Thursday nearly (I think missed by minutes) triggered an explosive move and the real squeeze of GME. Now that it has been suppressed, I unfortunately believe a rapid squeeze won‚Äôt happen; and again, I think GME will rise steadily ‚Äî and have some big weeks this year. I know it‚Äôs not the confirmation bias we all seek, but there has been some solid level-headed DD come out recently and I think if people aren‚Äôt setup for the long haul, they need to take a step back and position for that. For example: imagine getting in TSLA at $200 with a ton of shares and LEAPs; now, those folks are sitting on +300% gains and know the true meaning of holding long.   Position: 3/19 175c (will be cutting soon and pushing out expiry) & 30 shares (avg. cost $172)   TL;DR: Reposition for the long haul ‚Äî retail will win in the end, it just might take the rest of this year.
Fuck TSLA, NIO, and GM -> Go for Ford
So I want to know why Ford is still trading at 11$. I love ford, my first car I personally bought was a Ford Fusion. Microsoft wanted to partner with Ford ($F) but had to go with General Motors ($GM) because Ford already was talking to Google ($GOOG).  Position Disclosure: 20 $F 11$ calls for 2/5, 6 $IDEX 5$ calls 3/19  There's a fireside chat this Thursday where they lay out their EV strategy but here's why I'm in safe calls  1. Ford outsells NIO and TSLA byyy farrrr! 2. Partnership with Rivian isn't forgotten and a team committed for a futuristic EV design (more people like how the All-Electric Ford F150 looked compared to the Tesla Cybertruck (and won it in a tug-of-war battle recently)  3. GM is trading at more than 4x the price of F (buying Nikola and faking a EV Hummer video) 4. Back in 2014, the Ford navigation was using $MSFT Cortana's voice for their entertainment / engagement. I'm sure $MSFT wanted to partner with Ford but had to settle something like $GM because it was already talking with $GOOG (which has most chance of creating driverless cars). 5.  Ford unlocked it's CANbus that year and let developers go to town with their apps. For a moment their cars were used by $UBER and some private researchers in their driverless fleet  It's not gonna move to $50 but it definitely has potential to reach $20 imo. The price action is slow so many of the contracts (at the money) are cheap.
I‚Äôm down 70% but this is why i‚Äôm still holding GME! For the    üèº
If you check the short float here:       It is still at   [I was wrong about 2 days to cover]. Please check Volume sold and short float, explain that to me Hedge Fund interns? Hopefully you can explain or will just ghost this post right?   I‚Äôve put up a chunk of my savings and only selling will I have LOST. But FUCK that - this is all a game of psychology. Sure we might have lost the paper hands who traded for the first time in their lives.   It was expected. Doubling down to reduce my cost basis for EVEN MORE GAINS. What calms me is checking the volume sold, fuck all was sold. They short laddered just like the last dip. THIS AINT FUCKING NOTHING.  Don‚Äôt be the idiot that sold TSLA Pre-split. All you‚Äôll have is EVEN MORE REGRET.   TO THE FUCKING MOON!  Be smart about reading comments because it is confirmed there are hedge fund shills on here doing all they can to discredit us. They are getting paid for it so the motivation is high, THINK CRITICALLY

PLTR Upcoming ER, Lockup, 13F
Many of you clicking on this post are probably aware that   PLTR    has officially announced their   earnings   date for Tuesday,   Feb 16th   at   8am.   This means that the   lockup expiry   occurs that   Friday, Feb 19th (3 days after Q4 earnings release according to the S1 filing)  .    Everyone knows, in the majority of cases, going into lockup and the day of lockup the share price declines only to immediately start to rebound the day following lockup. In PLTR's  case, lockup has undoubtedly been a drag on the share price with many    shorting and fellow palansmarts waiting to buy in because of it. In this post I will provide my reasons why I am holding through lockup and why I think starting to scale in before earnings and lockup is a good idea (Also I am a retard so don't take anything I say seriously).     1. Having earnings before the market open usually means that earnings is bullish, or so I have heard, because management is confident enough in the quarterly numbers to not give the market time to digest them. With all of the new contracts PLTR's  earnings should be a healthy beat. 2. February 16th is the last day for institutions to file their 13F with the SEC to let everyone know what they have bought or sold for the 4th quarter. I am guessing based off of PLTR's  run this past quarter that many institutions have taken up position and that will be revealed on the 16th/17th. The reveal of these big buyers will cause a bit of fomo and look bullish, giving the market reaction to earnings a bullish bias. 3. Just because something like 80% (I have seen % ranging from 80 to \~66%) of locked up shares will be available to trade doesn't mean insiders will actually sell. We know that at the very least Karp and Peter are planning on holding shares/ownership stake through private investment firms that they own (Mithril Capital Management). That said there should be selling pressure... the obvious play.  4. PLTR  is currently \~31% off of it's intraday high from 4 days ago! There has been heavy shorting on low volume going on before yesterday's official earnings announcement. Now that we have a set date and the uncertainty has been removed we could see a bit of a run up into earnings. This is currently, in my opinion, providing a good entry point that may not last.   The fear of lockup is probably worse than the actual event.  I will likely hold for at least a year unless PLTR  decides to moon and free me from my 9-5.   Position:
Please control your risk. Please protect your mental health and wellbeing.
I have no position in GME  . I've been a member of this sub for a long time. I know this post is going to get downvoted, but I've got to make it because I am very concerned that we could have a wave of self harm urges depending on the way GME moves.  Please. For the love of everything... be careful. Control your risk. Control the size of your positions and what you're willing to lose. I am seeing posts about people throwing in a million at levels above 200 or 250. Saying that it's everything they've made in the past few years, or maybe it's margin, or maybe it's their ira or savings.  Eventually this has to come down. Every single spike like this has. Nothing moves from 20 to 470 in a few days and stays there. Going to 1000? Because Volkswagen did? There's no reason to believe that it will and if it does, that candle wick top could be a small amount of shares. Please, PLEASE... just don't trade more than you can lose. I really am hoping with every fiber of my being that this thing shatters the moon and goes to mars for all of you.   Once the collapse starts the order book could quickly evaporate. You could become trapped very easily and if you're anywhere above 100$ a share the odds of it coming back are extremely slim should this follow Volkswagen. They stayed under 30 for a decade once it was over. And it did end, and fast.  When things are extremely euphoric it's incredibly difficult to tell where you are at in the process. I don't know what's going to happen. What I do know, is that there's going to be some of us in bad shape, for one reason or the other.  I've been a trader for years. I've been a member here for quite a long time. I am making this post not to tell you what to do, but to recommend you manage what you do right now.  Some people are betting such large amounts so high up that they could find themselves in a mental break if they have bad luck. These kinds of movements are super exciting, but getting trapped with a large amount or margin amount high up on a flimsy spike can lead to self harm.  Which is why I want to urge you to use the hotline. If you're in a very bad place right now, please, use the hotline. Please don't use a permanent solution.  I love all of you guys. I love the memes you make. This part of the internet has been my favorite place for a long time. And I want all of us to keep making memes and having fun. Please be safe.
I hope hes right

Brief Thoughts on GME
"by the mere fact that he forms part of an organised crowd, a man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian‚Äîthat is, a creature acting by instinct."  Firstly, a few things:  1. People are here to make money, getting too attached to a stock by emotion and not rational analysis is not the way, as individuals, we should be looking to make plays with the maximum reward adjusted for risk (multi-baggers are nice, but what is the probability of it happening in each case? consistency is better). So if you can't defend your thesis, or even have a thesis on your position, you shouldn't hold or even buy. Sticking it up to wall street or buying it because everyone is doing can convince you to buy, but it's not a thesis. Understanding the opposite side of your trade and their thesis is an important part of this. 2. In order to have any sort of reasonable discussion, the participants need to agree on a common factual basis, and the scientific method in that anything can be disproven if given enough evidence. If data is a part of your argument, the source is of the essence. People laugh at antivaxx or flat earth groups, but they do the same thing (be dismissive and ignore all evidence against their beliefs) when it comes to "truths" they hold dear. 3. All investments are fundamentally a matter of price. The best company can be overvalued and the worst undervalued. The same GME is obviously a radically different investment when your average is 40 vs 400 for the individual who is investing. Let's say both embraces the possibility of losing their money, and aim for 1000. Well with the same probability of succeeding the odds are 1:25 and   There are much more opportunities in the market for   baggers than 25 baggers.  The Bear Case hinges on:  Given the amount of information at hand, what is the fundamental value of GME right now, how much should one price in Cohen succeeding in transforming the business? Those who short will be using fundamentals, since the momentum of the short-squeeze will eventually revert to a fair price. What that fair price is is debatable. How long that reversion happens will depend on the relative positioning of longs and shorts. But is likely that institutions have little faith in the ability of retail traders (who are majority long) to diamond hands.  So if you agree with the following:  1. GME is currently overvalued. 2. The short interest is low relative adjusted for time and probability of GME reverting back to fair value due to retail investors being fundamentally feeble: institutions are willing to hold much longer (see how much Melvin Capital blew up on their positions) until their thesis play out versus people who may not even have a thesis (not necessarily WSB, but retail who got sucked in past few weeks in general).  Then it obviously makes sense to short, some firms may have blown up themselves shorting at much lower levels, but other firms may have seen GME as an extremely attractive target while it soared past 40 and into the hundreds, there were even people on CNBC who blatantly said they were opening put positions, so this isn't much of a leap in faith.  My thoughts:  I would much rather put my money on the fundamental value of GME expanding rather than betting on a low probability event happening (the easy money has already been made, stop being greedy thinking GME making another 20x is at the same conditions as the last 20x). If we put the short-squeeze out of the equation, the drop from 469 is making GME rapidly approach a level where the risk-reward ratio based on fundamentals is something I'm comfortable with.  TLDR: Best time to enter/add is when the fundamental bull case for GME stands on its own, looking to enter around 40 where I will diamond hands until more signs of whether Cohen will succeed or fail in turning GME around (which will be a 10-20 bagger based on around 3B valuation)  positions: Sold 20C at cost basis 11 on 1100 shares so call me retarded  EDIT:  Anyone who thinks I'm bearish on GME is retarded and has not read the post. I have great faith in Cohen, but it's not a certainty, I am opening a position with a favorable risk rewards ratio with regards to how likely I think GME is to succeed in the next year to next few years.
How and why NOK will reach the moon?
NOK will colonize the moon and bring 4G to barbaric aliens! NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon.      First, in regards to Nokia‚Äôs business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia‚Äôs current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream.      Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn‚Äôt a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won‚Äôt happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer‚Äôs where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.  At   a share. NOK P/E ratio is   Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was   Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety.   With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate  income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research       The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump‚Äôs ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don‚Äôt think this is likely. But it‚Äôs certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.  It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares.   Form SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2020-02-05 12:16:19      And the new one showing the increase.  Form SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2021-01-29 17:21:09     Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question.   Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth.   Final words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.

A skeptic‚Äôs post: Can WSB win the GME standoff even if we want to?
I have been following WSB as a lurker for almost a year, and this has become my favorite sub on all of reddit. Shout out to I am absolutely rooting for y‚Äôall and all your proletarian tendies.  &nbsp;  I don‚Äôt want to rain on anyone‚Äôs money parade. But after reading lots of excited posts about ‚Äúrockets to the moon‚Äù, which seem to be full of excited confirmation bias, riding on  , I wanted to present a few arguments, as a total ignorant fool, about some strategic disadvantages I perceive in this battle, since I tend towards skepticism, and worry that there is too much buzz, and not enough strategic preparation.  &nbsp;   I was also inspired by  :    ‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù - Sun Tzu   &nbsp;     My caveat: I know literally nothing about investing.    &nbsp; &nbsp;      The advantages Hedge Funds have in the battle for the GME Short Squeeze:     &nbsp;     Information advantage    - The hedge funds will always have quicker, better access to information than all of WSB.     Coordination advantage    - They are one big organized entity, and can move their entire ‚ÄúArmy‚Äù of bets with infinitesimal speed.     Size advantage    - The hedges have more money at stake and in play than all of WSB put together.    Ally advantage    - They have powerful collaborators. The media, who doesn‚Äôt want a hedge fund to go bust. You can assume, the US government (and every other government), because they don‚Äôt want a stock market crash. And everyone who colludes with hedge funds,   all of corporate America.    Propaganda advantage    - Whether it be social media posts, bots, articles in mainstream media, they have enough money to blast out as much fake statistics and propaganda as they like. WSB does not.     Mathematical advantage    - A lot of trading has become complicated math. You can assume that every single analyst they have/need is working on the math to get them out of the hole they have dug themselves in. We are less good at math.    Speed & Precision advantage    - They can make trades and bets much faster, with a much higher precision than WSB.    Strategic advantage    - You can assume the hedge funds know your position, but you don‚Äôt know theirs. This in my mind is the most powerful of all advantages for them. Imagine you are playing chess against an opponent and have to decide which pieces to move, but aren‚Äôt allowed to see where theirs are? But they can ever  read your thoughts  (  this forum).    Legal advantage    - Given the very very light penalties even for something patently illegal in financial manipulations, it is in their very interest to do anything whose cost is ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù than the potential cost of the actual monetary loss, whether it be legal or not. If you were the CEO/Fund manager, you too would decide for illegality.  &nbsp;   So, the question then becomes, given this situation, in which for the hedge funds not only billions are at stake, but the narrative of their ability to make the market, and the propaganda of expertise they disseminate, how does WSB win and force the Short Squeeze? What are WSB's advantages? How do you make best use of them? Who are WSB's allies? How can they be activated? How do you deceive the enemy? How do you overwhelm them, tactically?  &nbsp; &nbsp;  A few initial thoughts on counter-strategies (Feel free to suggest more, and I'll add them in):  - The strongest narrative that might influence public/politics is that the stock market is a casino, and the house is not just taking its fees, but cheating. The stock market is no longer a "free market", but a place where big players make the rules, and use their wealth to make more wealth for themselves.  - WSB needs to find and activate allies. These might be the company itself (GME), value investors who believe in the free market and its efficiency, political/investment figures who want investment to actually mean something.  - Some disadvantages need to be turned into disadvantages. For example, it will be difficult to impossible for WSB to move in concert without alerting the "enemy" to its own ovements. So, how does one coordinate a move in which transparency becomes an advantage?  &nbsp;  My position: One free GME share I got from RH when I signed up.:)
Taking into consideration unrealized profits, I‚Äôm down a cool $44,420 in the past 48 hours. Still holding this Stonk STRONK and hoping it     once all those counterfeits fall off and people realize hedges didn‚Äôt sell shit and instead doubled down.
$CRSR Corsair DD / Earnings play
Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)   Redefining gaming, eSports, and streaming   Company Overview  Corsair Gaming is an American computer hardware and peripherals company founded in 1994 and headquartered in California.  They acquired Elgato Gaming in 2018 to expand to the streaming gear market, Origin PC and SCUF gaming in 2019 to expand into the custom-built PC systems and console controllers markets, respectively, and during 2020 they acquired Gamer Sensei and EpocCam, and partnered with Pipeline to grow into the gaming and streaming coaching market.  Corsair went public on September 23, 2020, with its IPO priced at $17, valuing the company at about $   Understanding the Business    Value Proposition    Corsair provides specialized, high-performance gear for gamers and streamers. Their products are designed to provide speed and reliability for competitive gaming, high quality content for streamers, and powerful PC components that allows gamers to run modern games smoothly.    Revenue Streams    Currently, Corsair groups its product offering into two segments: gamer and creator peripherals and gaming components and systems.  Gamer and Creator Peripherals:  which represents around 25% of net revenue, includes gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets, streaming gear, and high performance console controllers.  Gaming Components Systems:  which represents around 75% of net revenue includes computer cases, power supply units (PSU), high performance memory products (40% of net revenue), and custom-built gaming systems.  Acquisitions and Partnerships:  During 3Q 2020 Corsair acquired Gamer Sensei, a gaming coaching platform, EpocCam, an app that allows iPhones to serve as a webcam, and partnered with Pipeline, a course-based education platform for streamers.  Industry    Market Size    According to Jon Peddie Research, the global gaming and streaming gear markets is expected to reach $40B by the end of 2020. Before the pandemic JPR estimated the market to grow at a modest   CAGR until 2022. However, during 2020 the market has grown an estimated 10% year-over-year.  Additionally, DFC Intelligence research estimated that the video-game coaching market surpasses $1B.    Industry Fundamentals    Growth in the gaming and streaming gear industries are driven by strong and robust fundamentals.  Popularity of gaming is increasing:  According to Newzoo, there are an estimated   gamers worldwide, which are expected to spend $159B on games in 2020 and is expected to grow at an   CAGR to exceed $200B by 2023. PC and console gaming represents 51% of the total market, and mobile gaming 49%. Corsair has stated that currently there is no interest in expanding to the mobile gaming market.  Tech-driven improvements in game quality:  Advances in computer power have enabled gaming platforms to provide increasingly immersive experiences. This in turn, places increased demand on high-performance computing hardware.  Increasing gaming and streaming engagement:  Some interesting facts reported in the Limelight Networks‚Äô State of Online Gaming 2019 research report include:    On average, video gamers spend six hours and 20 minutes each week playing video games   More than 38% of gamers would like to become professionals if it could support themselves   Gamers from novice to aspiring professionals report missing daily activities due to gaming, missed sleep is the most pervasive   Watching gamers play video games online is more popular than watching traditional sports for 18-25 year olds.    The eSports and streaming flywheel    The rise in popularity and viewership of eSports brings more investment from publishers, sponsors, advertisers, team owners, and leagues to the eSports industry. Increased investment brings more players and increased performance focus of gamers who advance from less engaged gaming to high-performance gameplay, which in turn brings more viewers.  Competitive Landscape & Risks    Competition    The gaming and streaming market is characterized by intense competition, constant price pressure and rapid change. Competition across Corsair‚Äôs product offering includes:    Gaming keyboards and mice   \- Logitech and Razer    Headsets and related audio products   \-Logitech, Razer, and HyperX    Streaming gear   \- Logitech and AVerMedia    Performance controllers   \- Microsoft and Logitech    PSUs, cooling solutions, and computer cases   \- Cooler Master, NZXT, EVGA, Seasonic, and Thermaltake    High performance memory   \-  , HyperX, and Micron    Pre-built and custom-built gaming PCs   \- Alienware (Dell), Omen (HP), Asus, Razer, iBuypower and Cyberpower    Competitive Strategy    The company follows a differentiation leadership strategy by prioritizing high-performance and professional quality and charging a price premium on their products in exchange for superior quality, high value added features, and superior brand recognition.    Market Share    According to NPD Group, by 2020 Corsair had #1 market share position in the US in its gaming components and systems products with 42% of the market share from 26% in 2015. Their gamer and creator peripheral products are not yet market leaders, however, the company increased its market share in that segment from 5% in 2013 to 18% by 2020 in the US.    Growth Strategy    Move into the Asia Pacific region:  The Asia Pacific Region represents a long-term growth opportunity. According to Newzoo, they represent 54% of the global gaming community.  Complimentary acquisitions:  Corsair has carried out this strategy aggressively since 2018 with the acquisitions of Elgato Gaming, Origin PC, SCUF and Gamer Sensei. They plan to continue evaluating and pursuing new acquisitions that may strengthen their competitive position.  New Markets:  Uses of streaming gear has spread into areas including, podcasting, video blogging, interactive fitness, remote learning, and work-from-home, which represent a promising avenue for continued expansion in this product segment.    Threat of New Entrants    Because of the continued convergence between the computing devices and consumer electronics markets, increased competition from well-established consumer electronics companies is expected in the gaming and streaming peripherals segment (  use of Audio-technica microphones by streamers).    Threat of Substitution    A significant medium- to long-term risk for Corsair‚Äôs business model is the evolution of cloud computing and augmented/virtual reality entertainment.  Cloud computing refers to a computing environment in which software is run on third-party servers and accessed by end users over the internet, requiring minimal processing power from the end-user‚Äôs system. Through cloud computing, gamers will be able to access and play sophisticated games without the need of expensive high-performance PC systems and components.  According to Grand View Research, the global cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48% from 2020 to reach $  by 2027.  Additionally, Corsair must be able to adapt its product offering to meet the needs of the evolving augmented/virtual reality industry.    Moats    There does not seem to be any relevant, structural moats, that may prohibit competitors from capturing Corsair‚Äôs market share across their product offering.    Other Relevant Risks    Due to the concentration of their production facilities in Taiwan and China, Corsair may be adversely by geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.  Financial Summary    Proforma Balance Sheet         Income Statement         For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:    The 49% increase in net revenue is mostly attributed to a large number of consumers gaming and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The company‚Äôs gross margin is influenced by its product mix for the period, gamer and creator peripherals have a higher gross margin (25-35%) than gaming components and systems (15-25%).    Proforma Cashflow Statement       Cash used in investing activities consists primarily on the acquisitions of Elgato in 2018, and SCUF and Origin PC in 2019.

CMC Markets sentiment for GME.
What if GME were to bring back their Generous Quarterly Dividend Payment?
Hey Retards what if GME were to start declaring a quarterly dividend again? Last paid out Mar 2019 ($  before shorts started attacking. Looks like the vermon holding SHORT POSITIONS would be RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT to the owners of the shares #delivertheshares, if the they didn't BUY BACK before X dividend date.     TLDR: Buy the fucking dip and HOLD FFS. Stay the course.           Short Stocks and Dividend Payments   Shorting a stock is essentially selling it and then buying it back at a future price.  1 -Ôªø If the price falls, there is a profit. If the price rises to $  there is a LOSS. The stock needs to be BORROWED from a shareholder to sell it without owning it. A brokerage firm usually handles this process. There is generally a borrowing fee for the stock, depending on its availability and liquidity. Additionally, the borrower of the stock is responsible for paying any DIVIDENDS.     2Ôªø - If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are NOT entitled to the dividend.     3 -Ôªø In fact, the investor is instead responsible for PAYING the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.  Special Considerations:  Shorting stocks are considered RISKY and appropriate only for sophisticated traders (MELVIN IS A DUMBASS) due to the general upward trend of stocks, borrowing costs, and the skewed risk-reward nature of shorting. Over time, stocks appreciate as inflation erodes the value of currencies. Companies, through their business operations, protect against inflation as they can pass on rising costs to customers. This is one reason for the general upward trajectory of stock indexes over time.     Borrowing costs can be significant depending on the stock, typically between 2% and 10% annually.   30% in exceptional cases  .     4Ôªø -Ôªø Of course, there is the additional cost of paying out DIVIDENDS. This is a significant drag on returns and compounds the difficulty of the task. Finally,   BASIC MATH   works against short selling as well. A stock can go up by multiples if there is a takeout offer or the company comes out with some INNOVATIVE product.      I'm a fucking retard and have no idea what I'm taking about. I like this stonk. Buying the dips, holding since 2017.

Do the the skeptical claims about GME even make sense?
Alright, I'm not going to pretend that I have a deep understanding of finance, but some of the comments expressing skepticism about GME reek of pure bullshit. Here's some of the recent claims I've been seeing.    1. The shorts have covered!    The poster usually cites the massive drop in SI as reported by S3. Something like \~120% going into Friday, down to \~51% going into Monday. So, from a basic supply & demand analysis, this doesn't add up. Volume was relatively low compared to Mo/Tues/Wed and the prior week, most likely due to heavy restrictions (or outright bans) on buying GME shares on brokerages who ran into liquidity issues. If it were true that the shorts closed a massive portion of their short positions‚Äîpurportedly \~70%‚Äîon Friday, then we would've seen a massive hike in price because shorts would've been scrambling to buy, along with the few institutional/retail investors who weren't restricted from buying. This basically would've been the squeeze. But that's not what happened. The price did increase, yes, but it didn't massively spike, not to the degree that it would have had the shorts legitimately bought back shares  en masse,  as is being claimed.    2. Sure, but that just means that new shorts opened up at the top, that's why the price didn't spike to squeeze levels!    No, this can't be correct. If enough new short positions were opened Friday to artificially suppress and "hide" the supposed  massive  covering of short positions, then the SI reported by S3 would not have gone down‚Äîat least, it would not have decreased from \~120% to 51%. At this point, claims 1 and 2 aren't even compatible. They can't both be true at the same time. My guess is shorts have been "averaging up" their short positions the entire time in a rolling fashion. Everyone knows the price will crash after the squeeze happens, so it seems unlikely that shorts who were willing to risk bankruptcy over this would suddenly throw their hands up, cover most of their positions (even if it were possible in this short time period) and then not take out new positions at the height to recoup losses on the way down. It would seem more likely that the SI hasn't actually decreased much at all, much less over the past 4 trading days.    3. The shorts closed/are closing their positions this week! (Mo/Tues)    Again, I don't see how this would work. How could shorts be closing  en masse  while the stock price is in free fall, like it has been the last two days? When shorts close their shorted shares, they buy the stock. So, if the claim is that they've been closing their earlier short positions this week, then shouldn't we realistically have seen an increase in price? Especially with Monday's low volume? At the very least, the price should've stabilized, not plummeted.  It seems literally impossible for a massive buy back of borrowed shares to have occurred over the past 4 trading days while SI supposedly plummeted   and   without the price spiking to infinity, especially when those days were relatively low in volume in comparison to the days leading up to them.  One or more of these claims has to be false, right?  Maybe they did massively cover and new short positions were opened to suppress/crash the price simultaneously. In that case, SI should've stayed relatively stable or gone up, not crash from previous estimates.  If the SI really did crash, meaning shorts massively covered their outstanding positions, then price should've erupted.  If we just ignore the estimated SI entirely and assume that the shorts covered a while ago, and the spike at the AH last week was "the squeeze." That doesn't make sense though because why would shorts have tried to exit by buying back shares at the height of international attention? Between the shorts buying mass amounts of shares to cover and the gigantic wave of new retail investors wanting to get in on the squeeze, the price would've exploded well beyond what was achieved because who the fuck would've been selling at that point? What seems more likely is that the AH was simply a result of the insane media coverage and bullish hype drawing in lots of new long investors, both retail and institutional.  Hopefully someone can explain what I'm missing because I feel like I'm going crazy reading all this skeptical shit when half of it contradicts the other half.  I realize there are legitimate concerns regarding GME moving forward, but it seems like much of the original squeeze thesis is still viable. Am I just retarded?

If you are holding GME and are worried about the temporary price fluctuations, just unplug yourself from the internet, eat, sleep well, go take a short trip, play some video games and just enjoy life. Come back online to check the price in a month. Lo and behold. Your portfolio will be on the moon.
TLDR: Forget that you bought GME and come back a month later.   Remember, DFV has been holding GME for more than a year.

Are you sure Melvin is still short GME? Because if they're not then you're all just playing with yourselves.
Hi, former hedge fund trader here. First thing: In my 8 years trading for Wall street firms I never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with GME. In fact the only time I ever found myself naked short (accidentally) it was a huge problem, was almost fired, massive apologies to the prime broker, exchange, regulators etc. I certainly didn't make that mistake again. I can tell you that in Europe and Asia this kind of shit just doesn't fly. However, having seen the GME fail-to-deliver data on the SEC website, I'm pretty shocked that US markets appear to be riddled with corruption.  Second thing: If you're a trader or PM in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately. You never let an error run or dilly-dally before making things right. It's my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry. Ego, right or wrong, fair or unfair, they all go out the window and you take the loss, suffer the pain, and live to fight another day.   Now let's consider what happened last week: GME  traded > 500m shares. If Melvin were covering at 1/4 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares. That's twice the floating market cap. As such I'd say Melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already.  In that case, you're all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers (eToro et al) running stops of leveraged customers. The only way to fix this is for retail to stop buying GME derivatives and instead buy real stock and hold.  Happy to hear any evidence that they're still short but beware the integrity of such data.  All the best.
Big hedge funds are shorting ornamental gourds futures üçÜ
Listen here retards and listen well;   I am a French üá≥üá± gardner AND accountant so, if there is one thing I am qualified to speak of, it must be ornamental gourds futures.  Do I have your attention?    Now, I know a lot of you have lost money this week on GME buying the top and selling low, and I am here to help you get your wives back by showing you how to make it all back, multiply it, and stick it to the hedge funds once more  !     Do I have your attention now?    I'm not going to go again all over the great DD that was posted here over the past few weeks, but the margin on ornamental gourds is incredible. Some of these babies go for as much as 50$  !  and price has only been increasing over the past years as demand is literally exponential.   Ornamental gourds futures are the future. The info is readily available with a quick duckduckgo:              All it's going to take is another small yolo. The market cap for ornamental gourds is very small and stupid Big Hedge Fund is shorting wrecklessly. Don't believe me? Just look at this chart:      I don't know about you, but this clearly looks like a cup and handle pattern to me. All the ingredients are there. Shorts, cups, gourds, and a small market cap. All we have to do is BUY and    until the üçÜs go    . I know it's been a hard week, but scared money doesn't make money. Take another mortgage if you've already withdrawn your pension fund.   All in on ornamental gourds futures.   Put on your helmets.   This is going to the üåï, but only to set up a remote base to then   even further to uranus ü™ê.   Tl;dr Buy ornamental gourds futures if you want your wifes back.    Disclosure: I own a lot of futures in ornamental gourds. This is not financial advice. I just like gourds.
The loss before the storm, don‚Äôt worry brothers
Short Sale And Volume Analysis suggests squeeze is NOT OVER yet
I am neither a financial advisor nor I am advising anything financially. However, reviewing the history of short sale and volume since the squeeze started to play out and common theme can be explained as follows:     Every time short sale ratio goes up we hold and buy the dip. As they lose steam we pile on and stonk goes higher.     Push and Pull    1/27 onwards it seems traders have got involved heavily and while short ratio has remained consistent  (>50%), most of the volume is downtrading suggesting paper hands are being shaken out. As data suggest, new short positions were opened at peak price on 1/27 . While, Most of the squeeze happened with heavy volume in first round. I guess, the question to ask is what is required to trigger second round.  1) buy volume increase / reduced short sale ratio ? ( fellow retards currently waiting for account transfers)  2) Failure to delivery deadlines approaching ?  3) More good news from management/board, RC etc.
The bootlickers over at TradeRepublic gave this sorry excuse today for their GME shenanigans
DEAR W1ND,   we look back at a special week with unprecedented developments in stocks like GameStop or AMC.  We want to personally apologize to you, if you have been affected by the buy restrictions on those stocks! We haven‚Äôt done a great job explaining the reasoning behind our decisions. Below we answer many questions that you have asked us in the past days.  Those decisions were difficult and within a special market environment. Eventually, we failed to explain our thoughts to you and didn't get to the bottom of the problem in our communication. Some of you criticized us for our actions, others have been understanding. Thank you.  We have not managed to live up to your expectations towards a modern, democratic and free broker. We will continue to work very hard to improve things, while trying to be open, transparent, clear and to the point.  We started Trade Republic five years ago to build a better bank. We are excited that you are a part of Trade Republic‚Äôs community. Part of a group that empowers people across Europe to have easy, fast and free access to capital markets.  Many thanks Christian, Thomas & Marco Founders of Trade Republic    Why did Trade Republic stop buy orders for stocks like GameStop or AMC on Thursday?  We started the last week with new highs in transactions, active customers and without any problems. On Thursday, shortly after 7:30  , our trading venue Lang & Schwarz Exchange (LSX) suffered from a significant outage. This was due to database overloads at one of LSX's service providers. We then switched to our fallback trading venue Tradegate Exchange. After a few hours, the tremendous increase of orders in stocks such as GameStop or AMC led to delays in the execution of orders. Trading had to be temporarily suspended to increase capacity.  Trading started again in the afternoon. This was followed by another heavy load on the systems with several thousand orders per minute. To prevent further outages, we decided not to accept any buy orders for six stocks, including GameStop and AMC, after the XETRA close at 5:30   We decided to do this to ensure the availability of our service for our customers. There were concerns that there could have been rapid declines in prices for stocks such as GameStop and AMC in the wake of particularly high volatility. Technical delays could have resulted in losses for you. That‚Äôs what we were referring to when mentioning ‚Äúrisks to you‚Äù in our first message.   Why did Trade Republic block only buy and not sell orders for those six stocks?  Essentially, the additional number of orders for those six stocks overloaded the systems. However, we wanted to continue to allow sell transactions. It was important to us to give customers who held those highly volatile stocks the opportunity to sell the shares to take profits or limit losses.   Why was the limitation of trading lifted again on Friday?  We worked through the night and our team massively scaled up our resources. Our tests have shown that the systems remain stable even with a considerable order load. As a result, we decided to start full trading on Friday before the market opened at 7:30   On Friday we again saw peak activities but our systems ran without problems.   Why do you say in the first message that you want to protect the customers from risks?  Trade Republic stands for free access to the capital market and offers various asset classes. We do not want to tell our users what to invest in. Our first message to our customers was misleading. We did not distinguish well enough between the explanation (technical risks) and the information (risks of volatile stocks). At Trade Republic, many people are investing their money in stocks for the first time. Due to the unique events in the markets, we wanted to inform about the risks associated with volatile stocks for our customers who are invested in those. More risk information will be added to the app in the future.   Has BaFin ordered the resumption of trading?  No. Trade Republic is in constant exchange with the BaFin. Trade Republic has informed BaFin about the steps mentioned above. The decision to resume trading was made independently by Trade Republic. Contrary to media claims, Trade Republic was not admonished about non-compliance with regulation by the BaFin on Thursday. Following incidents and outages, Trade Republic continues to report to the supervisory authority and provides comprehensive information on the case.   Can something like this happen again?  Our systems easily coped with the maximum load of trading last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as Friday. Without the technical error of the service provider at Lang & Schwarz Exchange, Thursday would have also been a quiet, normal day. As a result, we have greatly increased our server capacity and load testing. At the same time, we are investing massively in our technical infrastructure to improve our offering further.   Has Trade Republic responded to third-party pressure? Does Trade Republic have relationships with hedge funds?  No. Trade Republic has never had and does not have any relationships with hedge funds or similar market participants. The decision was made by Trade Republic independently and only from a technical point of view.   Did Trade Republic respond to pressure from clearing houses? Were there liquidity bottlenecks?  No. Trade Republic settles all transactions with HSBC - one of the largest settlement providers in the world. There were no limitations in clearing & settlement in any way. Trade Republic does not have to maintain liquidity for clearing.   Does Trade Republic sell data to hedge funds so they can trade against it to make money ("frontrunning")?  No. Trade Republic conducts its trades through the Hamburg Stock Exchange which is controlled by a supervisory authority appointed by the Hamburg Senate. Trade Republic does not sell any data to third parties. Trading takes place at reference market prices,   from XETRA. Different to what is claimed in the media, the business model of Trade Republic is not comparable to the model of Robinhood.   Does Trade Republic lend out my securities?  No. Trade Republic never lends out securities.   Thank You!  YOUR TRADE REPUBLIC TEAM
IM STILL NOT SELLING $AMC FUCKING CHRIST
A short story that will inspire you to HOLD during these trying times.
‚ÄúHolding with my diamond hands!    üèΩ‚Äù he typed with trembling hands on his greasy keyboard. His girlfriend was deeply asleep next to him. She had come home late again last night after hanging out with Jake, the guy she jokingly called her boyfriend.  When GME goes to the moon and I get my tendies, she‚Äôs going to love me again!  His phone vibrated loudly on the nightstand next to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm outside,‚Äù the text preview said. Fuck!  His brother, Charles, was outside. He had completely forgotten about the family brunch - a long-standing tradition that was usually a monthly occurrence. The pandemic had pushed their brunch plans and it had now been six months since their last reunion.  He clumsily climbed out of bed. He found his jeans from last night on the floor and jumped into them. They were the only jeans that still fit him. The lightly colored denim was starting to fade. He picked a black tee shirt that was loose enough to hide his pandemic gut. It had deodorant stains, so he knew his arms would be glued his sides all day.  He watered his thinning hair. He sprinted back into the bedroom.  ‚ÄúBye, baby! I‚Äôll see you after my family brunch." He leaned in to kiss her cheek but she, annoyed, dug her head deeper into the pillow so that she could keep sleeping. He gulped at the purple bruise with teeth marks on the side of her neck.  The black Model S was sparkling in the sun. Their father bought it for Charles as a reward for getting accepted into the same neurosurgery fellowship their father trained at. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you‚Äôre wearing?‚Äù Charles laughed. ‚ÄúHa ha yeah my other clothes are in the wash.‚Äù  His brothers biceps were bulging through the expensive shirt he was wearing. A water bottle condensed onto the cup holders. Charles was the family prodigy and exuded confidence in every step.  The drive to their parents house consisted of shallow catch-up small talk. He kept his hands on his laps the entire time in order to hide the Dorito stains on them.                             --     ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you mean you‚Äôre out of money, Dale?!‚Äù His father bellowed. Images of $5,000 of expired PLTR YOLO calls came to mind. If I had picked the expiration date for two weeks later, I‚Äôd be rich right now... The other $5,000 his father gave him went into GameStop stock. He bought at the top, which was $350 dollars per share. It was now sitting at $80 per share.  They said I‚Äôd make tendies! They said it was free fucking money. There‚Äôs no way it could‚Äôve gone tits up. Diamond hands prevai-  ‚ÄúDid you spend it all on the fucking stock market again?‚Äù There‚Äôs no way out. I‚Äôm fucked. I don‚Äôt have any money. I need to tell him.  ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK! You fucking degenerate!‚Äù Charles was snickering next to him with his cell phone aimed at Dale. He was recording him. Susan, their sister, was blushing and looking at her phone. Their mother was embarrassed and looked worried.  Don‚Äôt give Charles a satisfying reaction. Stay cool. Diamond hands, baby.  "Dad. It's different this time! The shorts are ladder trading right now which is artificially bringing the price down. Plus, the short squeeze is coming any day now!"  He had no idea what ladder trading was. A user named u/PM_Me_Vagina_pics wrote that in a thread he saw earlier. Dale didn't even understand what a short squeeze was or how it worked. He barely grasped what puts and calls were and that's because Robinhood made it easy to do.  "You think you can beat billionaires at their own game?" his dad hissed through clenched teeth. His jugular vein was bulging. Or was that his carotid vein? I'll ask Charles later! He'll know.  "Yes! If we all hold on to our stock there is no way tha-"  ‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù His dad pounded his fists and left the table.  It wasn't even 11 AM and Dale had already ruined the day. Mother was mortified. Susan was scarlet. And Charles was chortling.  Most men would fold under the deep shame of being called a degenerate by their father. But Dale was not like most men. He took a bite of his blueberry waffles and pretended they were chicken tenders. Yummy!  A small fire was alive inside of Dale. The spark of that flame came from a meme that made him giggle earlier. In the meme, there was a picture of a chimp. Or perhaps it was an ape? It was the caption, however, that captivated Dale and gave him the confidence to buy 500 more dollars worth of Gamestop stock. The caption read:  APE STRONG TOGETHER

Start of part deux of the GME short squeeze
"  If  long shareholders see the tumbling stock as a new buying opportunity,  we may be at the start of part deux of the GME short   Ihor Dusaniwsky      The momentum against GameStop picked up on  Tuesday morning as the short-squeeze rallies fueled by traders on  Reddit's   r/WallStreetBets   forum started to unwind. Shares of the retail  investor favorite were sent tumbling as hedge funds and Reddit traders  alike were left to wonder what‚Äôs to come for the volatile stock.      Yesterday, GME saw continued short covering,  but to a much smaller extent than it had experienced over the last few  days. With today‚Äôs stock price weakness, we should expect short covering  to be minimal, with the possibility that momentum shorts jump into the  trade. Stock borrow availability has increased so shorts are once again  able to add on to or initiate short positions.      And GME‚Äôs fall may not be over: What may  exacerbate its stock slide are long shareholders trimming their holdings  and realizing some of the unrealized gains they‚Äôve earned as GME‚Äôs  stock price skyrocketed.      S3 data helps tell the whole story. Now, GME  short interest is $  billion, with   million shares shorted.  Traditional SI % Float is down significantly from its highs in the  140‚Äôs% at the beginning of January. The SI % of Float is st   and  the S3 SI % of Float, which includes synthetic longs created by short  sales, is at  , telling us that there‚Äôs  stock loan supply for  short sellers to access, should they want to short more shares. The  stock borrow fee on existing shorts is 19%, while the stock borrow fee  on new shorts is 10% to 20% fee.      Over the last week, the number of GME shares  shorted has decreased by   million shares, worth $  billion, a  decrease of -59% as its stock price rose +193%. We saw just over 1  million shares covered yesterday. Shorts are down -$  billion in  year-to-date mark-to-market losses, -278% for the year, and are up  +$  billion in profits on today‚Äôs -52% price move ($       If long shareholders begin to sell their  positions, expect short sellers to jump in and help GME‚Äôs stock slide  continue.

Capital loss tax implications - better to hold the stock if you just got in
Capital losses can be used to either offset taxes on capital gains OR to reduce taxes on ordinary income up to $3k. Losses greater than 3k? Good news! You can carry the write off forward (unless something has changed I believe indefinitely).  HOWEVER - you must hold the stock for longer than 30 days to harvest this against long term capital gains and ordinary income, which is why even if you have doubts about the stock going up, it could be advisable to hold. I certainly will be holding.

Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-G
Yes, this is a casino. Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there's an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.  If there's one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it's that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you'd like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.  Hopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It's the most accessible and I'm all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren't investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you've already missed the "value" phase and you're basically banking on something that's hard to pin down.  It's a slippery basis for an investment, but it's made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here's the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won't get you to tendie town. That's trading, not investing, and trading doesn't work out well for most people.  The unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it's a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you're an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can't sell at the peak. I think it's all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren't approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you're like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.  I'd argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they're investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a "movement" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.  DFV didn't initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that's exactly what he has in common with WSB's other luminaries.  If you can see what the market doesn't yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and  wait  (that's the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you'll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that's the part of the road you're on right now, but it's a good start.  Edited for TL;DR - Know the difference between trading and investing, and try to do more of the latter.

WSBs having a conversation with Wall Street
The real lesson we all need to learn from GME and DFV
Obviously the past couple weeks have been crazy and everyone is hoping to strike it rich, which I hope happens but face it, there are going to be winners and losers no matter what happens.   A lot of the new people here are probably aware someone named u/deepfuckingvalue make a fortune on GME but those who have been here longer have been watching this develop for a while. So now everyone is getting on the GME bandwagon because that‚Äôs how DFV made his money right? Yes, he did invest in GME but he did it by buying LEAPS.   If you don‚Äôt know what LEAPS are they are options a year or more out. DFV bought low priced leaps and it paid off big time.  The thing is, in the last year, anyone could have basically invested in anything  and made a profit.   The second thing he did was go big. Investing $100 isn‚Äôt going to change your life appreciably except in the most improbable circumstances. Risk what you can, but be willing to lose it all.    TL;DR, buy leaps and go big
At a certain point the pain doesn't hurt any more.
DFV Hold
There‚Äôs a reason why DeepFuckingValue is holding. Did DFV intent on this stock becoming a meme and blowing up? Did he intend Elon Musk tweeting GameStop? NOOO. He would of sold and took profits by now but no. He has done actual DD on his YouTube channel and he is here for the company‚Äôs growth and what GameStop could become! Everything was a pump and dump but here‚Äôs the correction and once GameStop announces something innovative, we mooning boys  So hold your milk and cookies because we‚Äôre here for awhile     Edit: ONLY INVEST WHAT YOUR WILLING TO LOSE
Some questions about GME
Alright retards I think there are some questions that need to be answered as far as GME goes. All that seems to become popular these past few days are diamond hand,   together strong means GME will go to the moon.   Look I love the memes as much as the next autist, but it seems as this is the only content in the sub right now. That and the repetitive DD about short interest still being high, short ladder attacks, and lies in the media.  I know this is starting to sound negative, but I‚Äôm not a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç   and believe in the OG GME DD, and am still holding my shares bought at $30, $140, and $240 levels, and I‚Äôm not fucking selling  .  With that being said though I still have some questions about the future of GME and hope these questions might bring a bigger picture to rest of the sub. I‚Äôll just list the questions below, looking forward to some answers.  1. What more can hedge funds do to drive down the price? We‚Äôve seen the short latter attacks, lies in the media, bots in our own sub. These institutions aren‚Äôt going to back down and have the capital and capability to manipulate the market. So what else can we except going forward from these bastards?  2. Do retail investors have enough power against the hedge funds to come out on top? I‚Äôve seen figures where retail own about 30% of GME, (please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) but say that all 30% held is that enough to trigger the squeeze?  3. What is it like from the hedgies POV? They‚Äôre obviously trying to trigger selling to help their short position, but what exactly does their short position look like? I am not well-versed and short positions but know the basics. So they‚Äôve borrowed shares that they eventually have buy back. What is the timeline on this? What is their penalty for delaying buying back the shares?  4. What exactly is happening with the brokerages and how much longer will this continue? Should have done more research on this, saw something about clearing houses, but can‚Äôt read too good. Why is RobinHood limiting orders? Is it due to hedge fund pressure or something else? Luckily I have been on TD and haven‚Äôt had problems, but majority of retail/WSB is on RH and these restrictions are hurting GME. What‚Äôs going to happen going forward with RH?  5. Realistically is the SEC going to do anything about the market manipulation, with either Hedge Funds or Brokerages? If so how will it help GME?  That‚Äôs all I got for now. I‚Äôll update if I think of anything else. I apologize if these questions aren‚Äôt relevant, have already been answered or are just plain stupid. I am a truly a retard.   Would love for other people to comment any questions they have as well, so we can get a bigger picture of GME going forward.

If you do not know something or don't have solid evidence, please stop posting 'DD' because that then becomes disinformation.
I know we're all autistic retards here but some are truly more retarded than others.  Plenty of people think they know something when they actually don't even know enough to realize that they don't know shit, and that makes you actually retarded.  For the love of god, if you don't have a link to evidence, or otherwise can't confirm your assertion, don't fucking post it. I do not want to hear that RC buying his allowed 7% (or w/e that post was) will trigger the short squeeze, that shit will not happen and is just a wild autistic gay retard conspiracy theory that's giving people expectations that won't be met, further decreasing their resolve when it inevitably doesn't happen. Maybe there will be the MOASS, maybe there won't. But posting stupid conjecture without evidence or, jesus fucking christ, common sense - is not helping anyone.  If you want to post your confirmation bias bullshit, instead, don't. This applies to all discussions here, no matter what stock.  This is not financial advice, this is me telling a bunch of retards to stop humping a doorknob.

They are shaming reddit as a whole which you can like raining photos on reddit. Does that make you out to be a redditor and make you bad? Media. yea your bad. They are blaming "us" as a whole. Everyone is their on person. Don't believe them at all. They are backed by the "people" that are fighting "us". They didn't even come and look at reddit.

Follow me here:    Pacific ocean La Nina that started summer 2020 is the strongest on Record since 2012         Strong La Nina = drought = reduced soybean yields. There's a 1:1 matchup of the last major La Nina (2011-2013) and the last big dip for soybean yield.         Reduced soybean yields + unprecedented Chinese demand = huge spike in soybean prices         Largest US crop export by far is soybeans         Biggest spike in soybean prices in 8 years means US farmers will be upgrading equipment. There's nothing farmers love more than buying a shiny new tractor with all the options on cheap credit with high grain prices.         From the article:    "Born, who grows corn and soybeans on 120 acres near Lovington, Illinois, about 135 miles northeast of St. Louis, feels confident enough that he‚Äôs investing money to upgrade aging farm equipment.

Future of Manufacturing: Desktop Metal (DM): short term and long term play
Hello fellow autistic children. I know GME is still the hottest thing around. But, I am here to present a smart play, short and long term.  Desktop Metal (DM) DD  DM is a pure play manufacturing company that develops metal 3d printers. They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.  The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.  Pros :  1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.  2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.  3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.  4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.  5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.  6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.  7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.  8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.  9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.  Cons :  1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.  2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc  (More cons are welcome)  My positions:  100 shares at $   7 calls for $40 05/21, 9 calls for $35 05/21, 1 call for $20 05/21  Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week. Also, for the Technical analysis geeks, this has formed a nice cup and handle shape and should be ready to rocket!  Buying May or further call should make 75-100% profit in the short term. Should hold shares for the long term.  PS: This is not an investment advice. I am a Mechanical Engineer and I love 3d printing and hence I have invested in this stock. Please do your personal DD.  Edit:
Selling at $469 would have been tiddies, but we‚Äôve gotta HOLD!!

$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls)  VALUE PLAY  please read üòå
9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.  Now, let‚Äôs look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.  I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $  market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.  If you look at GME‚Äôs short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($  market cap)!! üëÄ Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.  Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.  Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($    These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.  But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down.   days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.     Check out Tanger‚Äôs new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let‚Äôs hope he get‚Äôs it right with $SKT. üôèüèæ  FEB 15 PT: $55  $SKT         Do your patriotic duty and save the malls     We‚Äôll see how this goes ;) ü§™   all figures disclosed in this dd are simply estimates, please do not freak out at the author when you are swimming in a shit load of money

Takeaways from GME - Where do we go from here?
The Free Market Isn't Free    I have learned a lot in the last two weeks and I hope that some of you have as well. And I'm not talking about the fundamentals of investment, trading, or strategy. I'm talking about the mechanisms at play that tilt the market in favor of one group of people over another. Obviously this is an ever-evolving situation, but I think it's worthwhile to take the time to reflect on some of the key takeaways from the ordeal and start thinking about how we, both as a community and as individuals, can protect ourselves against falling prey to the same mistakes twice.  I'm not going to comment on whether there was intentional market manipulation on the part of hedge funds through all of this. It's immaterial to my thesis. What was exposed, first and foremost in my mind, is the uneven playing field that exists between institutional and retail investors. If possible, we should seek to find a way to negate those advantages and/or mirror them for the retail investor. I'll get into some ideas as to how this might be achieved later, but first let's dig into the advantages themselves.     Advantages Afforded to the Institutional Investor     Access to Assets    One of the fundamental assumptions of the free market is that equal access to assets ought to be provided to those with means to purchase those assets. Hence, there is an expectation that brokerages act in all cases as a neutral party, an arbiter between a buyer and seller meeting on equal footing. The events of last Thursday show us this is not the case. Many, if not most brokerages, restricted access to an in-demand asset, leading to an artificial decrease in the value of that product as retail was allowed to sell freely, but not to buy freely. Again, this is not commentary on whether or not this was an intended effect, only an observation that it was the effect that occurred. In my opinion RH had so little liquidity available they would never have been able to handle the volume and were fucked either way.  Institutional investors do not rely on brokerages the same way a retail investor does, instead trading directly between one another. This creates a sub-market that exists direct-to-seller that retail investors couldn't dream of. As such, they have much more control over the actual trading they take part in. Moreover, insofar as the possibility of a restriction exists on those that fit a particular profile that cannot exist on those who fit another profile, it creates a situation that can warp supply and demand on a macro scale.   Access to Information   This one is quite a bit simpler. Institutional investors have access to algorithms that can predict and execute on market moves, up-to-the-millisecond data on market-wide trends, in some cases even access to trends in buy and sell limits that can inform how best to execute their next big move. In short, while the data accessible to the retail investor is improving at a rapid rate, it pales in comparison to that available to the institutional investor.   Access to Capital   The impact of the disparity in access to capital manifests itself primarily in three ways:  First, the sheer amount of capital that these institutional investors can draw from affords them the ability to single-handedly impact the market for a stock. This is why GME went down into the low single digits to begin with (along with the help of what were almost definitely buck naked shorts, which are illegal as fuck). This ability to move the market is an even greater advantage when you consider the ramifications of the fact that what the people of this subreddit have been attempting in trying to execute the People's Short Squeeze‚Ñ¢ is essentially the same thing. So in that sense we're on an even playing field, right? Wrong. In order for our side to achieve the desired effect, we have to have a level of solidarity and commitment to the plan that in most cases is completely unachievable. As soon as a critical mass of diamond hands become paper hands, the whole thing falls apart. Now imagine what would have happened if Melvin weren't a single source of capital and instead a collection of millions of individuals each with their own free will. Realistically, half of them would have paper-handed out long before they shorted 140% of the free float of GME and this whole situation would never have gotten to this point.  Second, access to capital is only increased when you consider the willingness of others with just as much capital to bail institutional investors out when their position is all but dead. This is how you end up with the onholy trinity that is Citron/Citadel/Melvin all playing the same short position on the bet that there can't possibly enough capital on the receiving end of their play to make them lose. There is nothing even close to this kind of networking available to the retail investor.  Finally, access to capital renders regulatory fines effectively meaningless. If institutional investors can break the law in order to save their firm billions and it only costs them a few million, you'd better believe they'll do it every time. Their business is built on maximizing profit at all costs. Whatever moral compass they possess is a tertiary priority. Meanwhile if you or I get caught talking nonsense on a yahoo message-board, there's a very real possibility we go to jail.    Mitigating Disparities of Access    So, the game is rigged. We've always known that. But the average joe among us is finally getting a glimpse into just how that's achieved and that has the potential to empower us in ways that we've never before been empowered. If you don't know how you're getting fucked, you'll never see the dildo coming but if you know what to expect you can chop it off at the balls before it makes its way inside you... that's what my dad always told my anyways.   Anything from this point forward are just my ideas about how we might address these disparities, but the key here is that we start having the discussions. If every idea I pose gets torn down because it's retarded (and I'm sure that they all are) I'll still consider it a win if it starts a discussion about how we as a collective can work our way out from under the might of this behemoth.   I think it's time we start to completely re-imagine the way that small money invests and that we'd be best served by creating our own secondary market for securities that exists in parallel to, and completely independent from, the existing stock exchanges of the world. This secondary market should be entirely free of the influence of big money and serve as a platform for the transparent and honest trading of securities.  So how do we achieve these goals? Here's a list of guiding principles I've come up with:  - This marketplace should be open at all times, without closures or halts to the sale of any security. - Member traders have access to all their assets at all times.  - To ensure this, no person or collective should have access to assets on the exchange in the way a brokerage would; the exchange should exist as an infrastructure for the holding of assets in or movement of assets into, out of, and between one another.  - Such a marketplace should seek to be as transparent as possible in every aspect, and allow for built-in avenues for both direct and community-wide communication between its member traders. - To prevent the manipulation of this exchange, limits should exist for maximum allowable account size and maximum allowable assets to be transferred INTO but not out of an account. This allows an individual to make a hypothetically infinite amount of money, while disallowing the ability for any single actor to exert undue influence over the market. - No liquidity should be required by the exchange itself. To achieve this end, trading should occur directly between individuals and no trading on margin should be allowed - All accounts should be linked to existing brokerage/bank account(s) belonging to one person and validated against gov-issued ID. This prevents bad-faith actors from attempting to exert undue influence on the market by opening multiple accounts. - All members‚Äô profiles display a history of all trades completed by individual, but not current positions or transfers of assets in or out. This allows for a full log of market trends available to all traders without providing an excess of information that might give other individuals an advantage in trading. - Stocks only; no short positions. Don't get me wrong, shorts have a purpose but the concept of borrowing shares and re-selling them later is antithetical to the idea of each account having in it only whatever assets that individual currently owns. - All Intra-Market trades and trends should be visible to all member traders.  I hope you've enjoyed the musings of a hopeless retard. My ideas are probably garbage but they're garbage born of a desire to find a better way. Even if I haven't done that myself, I hope that we can do it together. Apes together strong. Have a good night.  EDIT: Pretty sure it‚Äôs auto mod but every insightful response I‚Äôve gotten has been immediately removed. Can‚Äôt we do better?

HUGE Uptick in Short Exempt Volume Today for GME Because Brokers Can Fuck You Publicly!
Created some plots using Finra's daily reports on short volume\[1\] since I was getting curious about the shorts since last week.... Below are the plots I put together with definitions by Finra.

Broker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it  qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of  non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution.   That means that if  prices come in outside the      ,  they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have  qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets.   Marking for these orders  is signified by SSE. All orders marked SSE will be closely checked by  self-regulatory organizations and the SEC for compliance with Regulation  SHO exceptions.

Haven't sold. This is a dark day for many. Especially out brethren at 300+ a share. We were minutes away from a short squeeze when it peaked for the second time. The problem now is simply morale. Do not lose hope.
100K of profit, gone, reduced to atoms. Now, where do I invest in $ROPE? :KEKW:
Why I'm Holding GME
Whether GME comes up or not, what i can't let go and why i won't sell is bc all the news networks peddling that we 'moved to silver' for days when we obviously weren't and the fact that every time a squeeze was about to happen they stopped allowing us to BUY killing the momentum.   When the price went below 100 they  conveniently  let us buy again. Shit is ultra rigged and i feel like every share i hold is a protest. Every share i hold is another diamond layer on my already diamond-encrusted hands.  GME 40 shares @ $129 i believe in this stock and i believe in RC
Still being retard.
Short Interest, why numbers seem weird
If you were wondering like myself how the short squeeze could have already unwound, the short answer is, it hasn't, they merely changed how they are measuring it.     Found this in a comment buried in a comment on a post (  and thought I would shine some light on it. The sober view post has some very good DD presenting both potential upside and downsides in what I believe is a fair manner. Be cautious, there are a lot of downsides. I recommend you read it before you simply get hyped. That being said... Hype Train inbound üöÇüöÇüöÇ       Pretty much the reason why S3 partners is estimating 55% short interest is because they changed the formula. It would be equivalent to what we would call 122% SI before the change (other people's math, not my own).     They changed the formula from   `SI = (shorts/float)` to `SI = (shorts/(float+shorts))`  This formula guarantees SI to always be beneath 100.   Pretty much,   0% is still 0%  50% is the new 100%  It doesn't scale up exactly linearly.  Do your DD, this is not financial advice, just thought I would bring this to light.  Be careful, do your research, not only is the game changing in front of us, but so are the standard measures.  Edit: Moving the tweets from S3 Partners here so you don't have to dig down through multiple links             Edit 2:  Cleaned up some formatting for mobile, added link to sobering post  Note:  I am not claiming the short squeeze is still happening or that it is likely happening. I would guess it's very likely they bought high strike puts which would make the amount we would have to go up SIGNIFICANTLY higher.  Assess your own risk, read the sobering post linked above, and seriously consider the risk you're willing to assume  Edit 3: Also if CNBC quotes this... Hi Mom, love you
Quick DD: Why S3 Partners' Short interest data is either BS or it is saying shorts doubled down
Courtesy to u/smohyee for inspiration and picture     Last few days there has been this talk about shorts already covered, and S3 Partner's data showed a large decline in short interest. However, is this the full picture? We will be looking at this using Math.   Context :    ""it reduces the traditional SI % Float, Instead of Shares Shorted/Float our calc is Shares Shorted/ (Float + Shares Shorted) ""  Basically, the S3 short interest is calculated as  f(x) = x/(k+x)  where f(x) is S3's short interest, x is shares shorted, and k is float, which we can assume is a constant  For the Math savvy autists, you probably already see the problem. If you are not, open Desmos and graph the above function.  For k been positive and real, This function   asymptotically approaches 1     100%. It should be pretty obvious - shares shorted + something positive is larger than shares shorted, so the fraction is smaller than 1. And, surprise surprise, data before 1/29 have short interest higher than 1!    That means that either S3 partners is completely bullshiting their data, or the more likely case -  short interest displayed before 1/29 is traditional interest.    Looking at this tweet  , we can see that the traditional SI on 2/1 is       shares on       float, which equates   roll please...     153%       Short interest!     So not only have the shorts not squeezed, they have doubled down. And this explains the price action much better - the price dipped down on a   Increased selling  .   Disclaimer: I'm a Physics nerd and I know jackshit about finance and investment. This is not professional advice and you should disregard it as nerd squabbling.
Possible HF strategy to shake out the üìÑ  before the
They know that at a certain level potential üìÑ  will no longer see the point in selling their shares. Who in their right mind would take massive losses and sell their shares when the price is, say, $5/share? Why not just hold and hope for a brighter day down the road? They have to keep the price above a reasonable level so that those shares wont be locked up.  Most of those üë®‚Äç   who got in at <$30 are locked in on principal or are playing with the house's money. They aren't going to budge. The easiest people to shake will be those who bought in late. We are now below the $100 psychological level where paperhanded bitches will fold given enough time.  My guess is the play COULD be to seesaw from maybe $50 to $90 with occasional blips down into the 30s or lower to make it APPEAR as if the price is both settling and volatile enough to warrant a rapid descent. It could go on for days or weeks depending on what their books look like. That will scare a fuck ton of the bitches out of the game AND put the diamond handed retards in a position where they might actually consider selling.  So what's OUR play? As always: HOLD. This can only go on for so long. The shorts have to get covered. They are lying and manipulating to minimize losses but those who stay in the game will be rewarded IF we all call their bluff.  Even if this is completely off base, fuck them I'm holding. No more mister nice üêí. The government bailed them out in 2008. Now they bail US out in 2021.  Not financial advice. Obligatory

Banks rigged GME to stop the infinity squeeze and are now trying to get WSB to buy silver so they can make up their losses, proof included
Wall St. rigged GME to prevent the infinity squeeze. This is a fact.   They are actually trying to do the same with silver because banks have a massive net short position, proof included.     Wait, banks are massively short silver in the futures market?  Yes  Your title bashed silver though? Yes, it‚Äôs the only way to post about silver right now. Forgive me WSB gods.  You want me to sell GME and go into silver? No. Hold your GME and go to the moon if that‚Äôs your play.  While GME is the current religious level obsession of WSB, there are people who are still interested in other plays. We‚Äôre not your enemy, WSB used to be a place where people could pitch all kinds of trades and bulls and bears made fun of each other but didn‚Äôt try to ban one another.   There is a lot of disinformation going around that somehow silver is being pushed to help the hedge funds and banks recover losses from GME or something, but that directly conflicts with their massive net short interest in the silver futures market.  Further, silver has gapped down several times over the past year and there was never a peep from regulators.  Over the weekend all physical silver bullion from retailers completely sold out and Monday saw silver massively gap up. That night the CFTC raised margin requirements and today silver plunged.   When it‚Äôs speculative longs buying silver and banks shorting silver, it‚Äôs the longs who were forced to sell today when margin requirements were raised.  Banks have essentially unlimited liquidity so a margin raise doesn‚Äôt affect them like it does speculators who are individuals.    This is why for the short squeeze to work we need futures traders who won‚Äôt use their margin to max out long positions. Drastically cut back your leverage or don‚Äôt use it at all. Hold the cash you need to actually buy the silver at expiration, and then take physical delivery.  The shorts won‚Äôt be able to get enough silver to satisfy the contracts and will be left scrambling and silver prices absolutely soaring.  The silver short squeeze is an entirely different animal than GME, but it‚Äôs pretty obvious from the public data on net positioning by banks, and the immediate regulator action to the surge in price, that this is another case of retail vs corrupt wall st. banks.    Silver surfers are fighting the same battle you are but in a different market and with bigger opponents. The trade appeals to a broader audience than just WSB though as there are doomer boomers who have been ranting and raving about this day for the last 2 decades who are also willing to dump their money into exposing the silver futures market for the fraud that it is.
FISV WILL DOUBLE BEFORE EOY
Been holding $135 leap calls since $92, playing weeklies for the short term trades, and it‚Äôs only gonna get better as it has for me. Here‚Äôs a little of my own DD.  There is So much to talk about. But, the First Data deal made Fiserv a powerhouse in payment processing and digital payments when they took over Clover. This market has three main pillars: Point of sales (POS) terminals Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments E-commerce solutions   Being a leader in any one of these categories should make Fiserv a $100 billion company. Its current value is $70 billion. But Fiserv is now the largest POS provider and P2P payment processor... And the company is going to use its expansive network to quickly build out its new omnichannel e-commerce solution. A leader in all three of these categories has the potential to be well over a $300 billion company. FISV is partnered with Zelle, does more payments than PYPL‚Äôs Venmo and SQ  CashApp. PYPL has a market cap of 278 billion as of last Friday. If FISV can get to $100 billion it should put its PT at $150 and that‚Äôs very low ball. Their margins are going to continue to grow and if they just matched PYPL market cap, it would put them over $300 a share. There are several potential catalysts as far as buy backs, earnings, etc.   As I mentioned above, Clover is bigger than Square, yet is only part of FISV business, and the two go after different markets. Clover (generally) works with bigger businesses. Over 90% of Clover customers process over $125,000 in payments annually. Only 65% of Square‚Äôs customers transact that much. Not trying to bash SQ, only showing that FISV has a lot of catching up to do as it is still trailing SQ market cap by 30 Billion.   The difference between Zelle and PYPL‚Äôs Venmo and SQ (cash app) is that Zelle is backed by multiple large institutions like Chase, Wells Fargo,   Bank, and Capital One. The traditional financial institutions basically joined together to build a network so they wouldn‚Äôt be outdone by the likes of Venmo or Cash App. The advantage is that all of the financial institutions involved in Zelle are marketing the P2P service to their customers and it‚Äôs only going to grow. Fintech will be one of the hottest sectors going forward and FISV will be the leader. No reason why FISV isn‚Äôt at least $150-200 by EOY. Earnings 2/9. Don‚Äôt miss this undervalued STRONG company.

Post $GME and $AMC - Next Potential Short Squeeze Target ($TLRY)
For those of you still holding $GME and $AMC, Congratulations! Over the past week you've been bombarded with numerous challenges, from brokers restricting purchases, fake news, to stock dilution. It is always harder to hold a winning position than a losing one so my hats off to you sir if you are still holding.  With that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a next potential candidate for our short squeeze strategy. The company is Tilray ($TLRY). You've probably seen this symbol floating around in different posts but I'd like to talk to you specifically about the numbers and the timing of it.  If you've been living under a rock or on a tree (You ape) Tilray is a Canadian Cannabis company with its stock traded on the Nasdaq (Not a lot of legal Cannabis companies are traded on the regulated exchanges so this is a big thing). Aphria ($APHA) is in the process of acquiring Tilray and post-acquisition will become the largest Cannabis company in the world. The deal is expected to close sometime during the second quarter and $APHA will be taking over the Tilray name and the $TLRY symbol on the Nasdaq.  As per Yahoo Finance, the latest float is about 95 Million shares and even though the current shares sold short (From Jan 15, 2021) is   Million which is moderate, one should pay attention to the historical total shares sold short which from a month ago has grown more than 24%. This means there is something in play and I am also willing to bet based on current price action and historical trends, the next short interest release will go up as well.        Based on the amount of money involved there is probably one large or multiple large hedge funds playing this since they are the only ones sophisticated enough to sell shares short especially involving that much money. You can also look at the price action itself prior to Monday (When Good news got released) during different times of the day, there are always trades put in near the closing to make sure the prices don't exceed a certain price level which indicates true active manipulation by the bears. Retail traders are not sophisticated enough to do this thus indicating large hedge fund involvement.  There are a couple of factors that will help us with this conquest.  1. The Timing and News: Obviously, with this democratically controlled congress, legalization is a priority and has the highest chances of succeeding in this current political environment. As you have seen before (Do your own DD), any indication or news of progress of legalization has pushed this stock up. As of Monday, three senators; Chuck Schumer (NY), Cory Brooker (NJ), and Ron Wyden (OR) just promised to introduce marijuana legalization reform in the "early part" of the year. So there is a string of news and progress coming. 2. Way better fundamentals than $GME and $AMC: The poor fundamentals obviously bothered a lot of people who wanted to buy $GME and $AMC. But in comparison, if you dig into Tilray's financials, it is significantly better. Especially the cash balance. Mostly importantly, Tilray's product lines are diversified and they are currently still growing (this is a big thing for any business), especially in the international markets. 3. Its already primed: If you dig around Reddit, WSB, or even Stocktwits, you can see numerous people have already committed to baggage holding this stock. You are not too early and you won't be the only one to do so. 4. Harder for Management to Dilute the shares: As we saw previously, one of the challenges for the buyers of $GME and $AMC was battling against management's decision of stock dilution by the companies themselves. To put it in retard terms, diluting a stock is essentially printing more shares thus creating inflation in the stock so its harder to go up. Since Tilray is in the process of the acquisition by Aphria and it is an ALL STOCK deal via conversion ratio, it makes it harder for Tilray to implement dilution without significantly risking the deal. 5. Lightning can strike twice: A short-squeeze already happened in the past (2018) so you know the short-squeeze strategy already worked for this stock so it can work again. The brokers and exchanges are more prepared as their volatility risk models are already prepared to support significant high levels of volatility for this stock. Less chance for disruptions. 6. A means to an end: Lets be realistic, if you are holding $GME and $AMC right now, you will sell it. It could be tomorrow or it could be 3 years from now (If those companies are still in business) but you WILL sell it.  THAT is a very long time to hold baggage just to prove a point and you know the businesses you are holding suck from a business standpoint. Now since the Tilray and Aphia acquisition deal is on a timetable which will be completed sometime in the second quarter, that can be your exit time. You can go out gracefully if you choose to as you've already proven your point, made some money, and on the dawn of Tilray becoming a different company and under new management. For those of you choosing to keep those those shares post acquisition, how would you feel about holding shares to the largest Cannabis company in the world with good fundamentals, and on the dawn of full federal marijuana legalization? I would love it. 7. Great Symbolism: Lets face it, investing in a failing gaming company and movie theaters during a global pandemic doesn't really scream smart symbolic reform or via la revolution that well. But if you choose to focus on making a stand with a legal Cannabis company with a great future you can at the same time promote marijuana legalization and stick it to the hedge funds and dark capitalism at the same time. What better way to make a point to promote a great cause, symbiotic change, and at the same time make some money (If we are all on board).  Ok that's it! Kudos to you for making it to the end. Apologies for the long post but I really wanted to  get my points through. You all should obviously do your own due diligence and if you see what I see and the immense opportunity that is in front of us, and agree with my thoughts then lets do this!  BTW, if you are really retarded; I am NOT telling you to sell your $GME and $AMC. I'm only suggesting that we should start to look at other potential candidates for our short squeeze strategy to continue our cause of burning hedge funds and dark capitalism.  I just feel Tilray is such a great candidate for our cause and strategy especially with so much marijuana reform coming our way. We can make a greater point for a greater cause.  Thank you and trade well,  ElJefe2800

GME urgent RE-EDUCATION - unify, clarify, focus and execute
How can I start this.. the paradigm that defines our role on GME needs urgent and drastic clarification  if we are to steer this thing back onto the road.Whether we want to admit it or not, we're fucking drifting atm. The hype is dying as all hypes do, the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability ("we're all poor so we don't care, it's either moon or bankruptcy").  TH THA THA TH, time out.  Listen up fucktards, I'm poor too, but that's not the point. We need to go over the whole situation with perspective, and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells.     Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.   It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.     Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom.   To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.     Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:  \- a boogeyman   \- something blocking the goddamn exit     The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit t  each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.    It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.     THEN, we come.   We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.  What are we? We are bodies.   Pilling up.   On the fucking exits.  The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.     Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman   something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.  Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.  That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares   say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a  , even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.     Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.  We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time   WILL NOT SURVIVE ON   IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.     We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.          TLDR -      The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype   need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.          Obviously this isn't financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyways.
I‚Äôm speechless, truly.
Stop letting random idiots post their plays and distract from the main plays of GME and AMC!! We gotta have some more order in here. We can't let the media keep spreading lies about the plays being made by wsb. Let's get some shotcallers!!
Why are letting any random person of the 8mil cause distraction away from GME and AMC. That's what happened with the SLV bullshit. This subreddit is going to be worthless with a bunch of idiots calling out their own personal plays are that are dogshit and hoping for the subreddit to bail them out. If only a few select leaders from the subreddit can call out plays than that media bullshit will get shutdown instantly once its gets posted. Because the people will know that it wasn't called on reddit. Especially Melvin not being able to come here.
Am I doing it right?
I‚Äôm not doing this for myself
Like another post I saw recently, I stupidly decided to tell some friends and family about my $GME position.   shares @ $  average. Most are telling me I‚Äôm an idiot for not selling at $450 and that I should just get out now before it‚Äôs too late, but fuck that. I don‚Äôt give a shit about the relatively small profit I could make if I sold rn. This is about more than my personal profits, this is about showing the 1% that we might be a bunch of retards, but we aren‚Äôt going to bow down to their coordinated attacks and overall deception, in both the media and in the markets. I‚Äôm holding for each and everyone of you retards who bought 2 shares at $450, those who YOLOed their life savings at $126 per share thinking it was the big dip before the boom, for the mouth breathers who took student loan money to buy shares. We‚Äôre all in this together, no matter what your position is, or level of retardation. This is our opportunity. All I know is, I can die a happy man knowing that I didn‚Äôt bend over to shafting the establishment is trying to force on us so we run scared with our hands wrapped around Melvin‚Äôs cock begging for them to buy our shares. We didn‚Äôt come this far for that. It‚Äôs not about the tendies anymore for me, it‚Äôs about principle. They can pry these shares from my cold diamond hands. Do it for your fellow retard. HOLD

Why BB and GME are diamond hands and have huge potential
BB is a solid company transitioning to being a software only company, see the following post from r/stocks \-->    Now to the main subject GME is still an undervalued treasure. I know it seems like it might be overvalued because of the euphoria around GME these past two weeks, and how the media (and even some folks on wsb) try to portray it as a bubble, which it isn't.  1. Its a company with around $6 billions in annual revenues, and a new set of innovative leaders (Cohen and friends) who have a track record of turning companies into money printers (Chewy Inc now worth over $44 billion, was first losing money and bringing less than $26 million in revenue). 2. Its growing its E-commerce side by a whooping 254% (25% of all revenue was form online sales last quarter). Source -->   3. The future is bright, those that can weather the storm will reap the fruits and tendies that GME and BB have to offer.     tl;dr: Hold retards, we're going to the moon, paper hands will watch us and cry themselves to sleep and Melvin and Co will be giving blowjobs in Popeye's toilettes to come up with rent money.     PS: I'm not a financial analyst or anything, just a retarded software engineer who loves wallstreetbets and all its retards.  PS-5/Edit-1: Those that made tendies and all the retards, shop at GameStop, help your local business, save jobs, give back to the community and make more tendies.   Godspeed, and to the moon     As requested by a retard, my positions below (I got multiple trading accounts with different brokerages, this is one of them)

For fucks sake hold!!! THIS SHIT IS GONNA POP GME!!! AMC!!!
DO NOT BUY CALLS IN MARGIN ACCOUNT !!!
It's obvious that stocks like GME and AMC are prime targets for short sellers who want to bring the price down.  Collusion between RH, prime brokers and the DTC can potentially   the effects of the short squeeze because of loose and unsanctioned SEC rules regarding Regulation SHO that governs short selling, and in this case,  .  If you have a margin account, brokerages do not need your permission to lend your exercisable shares if you buy a call or sell a put. This is their way of temporarily creating shares out of thin air, aka counterfit shares. While you wait for expiration date, brokerages keep a tab of all its customers' "lendable shares" and sends it to the DTC in this thing called the share borrowing program. The DTC will then lend those to other brokerages whos customers just bought a call option that is essentially a naked call initiated by the seller. Now while this call option remains open, since it's a naked short, the shares get to be lent again into another new naked short in a other brokerage, in   an ever-perpetuating cycle that results in a temporary increase of the number of total shares traded  .  This trick hedge fund use is called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS), and there are many other ways for shortsellers can manipulate the stock price, inclusing Ex-clearing and Fails-to-deliver strategies.  So if you buy a call or sell a put from a margin account, you're essentially allowing the number of total shares to grow artificially which makes the price go down!!!  Plus, these created shares cannot be accounted for, but in most cases, undiscoled short shares typically represent 20 to 50 times the number of failures-to-deliver (which is the only metric the SEC tracks).... that's HUGE!  All of this information can be found in this complex but  . PLEASE SHARE
Why didn‚Äôt someone do this before us?
If a bunch of autistic apes could figure out all they had to do was buy and hold, why didn‚Äôt some hedge fund figure out this shit is 140% shorted and all that they had to do was drop like 900 million on shares of GME and boom they have control of 90% of the float, and not sell at all and they could basically just do exactly what Porsche did with Volkswagen in 2008. Now the mkt cap is 6 b but it used to be only 1 and you could own most shares with a billion. Like Mark Cuban said, this isnt the first time this is happening, but it‚Äôs the first time a community is the one going after the shorts, so why didn‚Äôt someone do it before us?
NOK Stock go Brrrr
Here‚Äôs why NOK stock is an undervalued long:  So before the downvotes just rub those two brain cells of yours together for a minute to focus on this for the next three minutes. (Fuck you I know what I said)  Due to all of the paper handed bitches, hedge funds shorting, and just general fuckery at the hands of retail trading apps, particularly robinhood, NOK is currently on MASSIVE discount.  Why do I say that? Because the fine folks over at DNB markets, Norway‚Äôs leading investment bank, have raised its stock valuation to ‚Ç¨ , or for those of us who speak freedom, $   Why does that matter? I hear you starting to ask. Well it matters because it‚Äôs currently trading at only $    There is over a dollar of pure value just waiting to be claimed. Not to mention it is expecting a very strong earnings report that can cause that value to go up even more. O and the company had been vocal about wanting to start its dividend payments back up. This earnings report should put them on the map for a lot of people. I‚Äôm buying more tomorrow, see y‚Äôall in space.          TLDR: worst case I make $1 per share as it goes up back to its evaluated price, or I ü§≤ until it hits $10 a share as it‚Äôs 5G grows in the coming years.   I‚Äôm not giving investment advice and no one should take this as such. Just did some research and wanted to share.   Sauces that caused my smooth brain thoughts:          EDIT: my current holdings are   shares @ $  Buying more tomorrow cause I really like this stock.

GME Gains (Summarized Across 5 Accounts)
NIO has been  ‚Äôs about to change
üìà üìà üìà üìà  automod  pls     First of all, yes I am still HODLing my GME shares.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî       NIO DELIVERIES IN JANUARY INCREASE             FROM A YEAR AGO                This was NIO‚Äôs 6th consecutive month of sales growth, and they‚Äôve now delivered 82,866 vehicles. They continue to outperform Xpeng and Li Auto, BUT are still trailing behind Papa Elon. So who gives a shit?  YOU should.  üí¶üò©  NIO is  only up 5%  over the past month, lagging and consolidating behind the broader market. Despite the fantastic delivery numbers AND the corresponding increase in EV market share, the share price DROPPED 2% today. Reminder that Pooh Bear J-Ping wants   25% of all new cars sold in the country to be electric by 2025  . NIO‚Äôs continual market share growth into  the  largest EV market in the world is literally an unmatched opportunity, with China‚Äôs EV sales             In addition to deliveries, NIO is rumored to be looking to   expand into Europe   with it‚Äôs SUVs.  THIS MAY BE THE LAST ENTRY POINT BEFORE THE RUN-UP AFTER EUROPE EXPANSION PLANS  They‚Äôve also recently released their first sedan model and are expanding their Battery as a Service infrastructure throughout China. It also goes without saying that having active backup from your authoritarian country is VERY helpful.        2021 Price Targets?  Median: $69 \ (nice)\ ‚ôãÔ∏è  Morgan Stanley: $80‚úÖ  üî•  High: $100  üî•     \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~     ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®Lastly, but perhaps most importantly.

See the Unusual Whales photos  . ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®                 Shoutout to Unusual Whales, they are awesome and put in a lot of good work that is really helpful with following the flow.

To EUCOM first for NATO Air Defense missions, with more ordered for more Army units that haven't even been created yet.   In 2012-2014 the army did an audit to determine that Short range Air defense was majorly deficient in numbers and capabilities. There is demand for their services.

Clarifying the endpoint for me as a newb (GameStop and AMC)
Kudos to everyone calling out shenanigans with the stock market.  As a newbie to stocks, can someone clarify what the endpoint for GameStop and AMC is?

I might be a real retard. Sold at +-40% loss, without knowing.
I decided to dip my toe into stocks with GME. Bought one share @ 112, just to test the waters. I fell asleep last night(I'm on heavy painkillers) with my trading app open, and when I woke up I somehow had closed my position @ 94. I immediately bought the share back, but it still stings.

We‚Äôve fucked a few hedges, were gaslit and misguided on our way to bending Melvin over, and most importantly, we‚Äôve seen big losses, but we‚Äôve HELD, because   ü¶ß STRONGER TOGETHER . However, there exists a trove of individuals, high and mighty within the history of all of r/wallstreetbets, that have assimilated and executed a coup, unbeknownst to us beautiful retards. Lost in the sauce, lost in the losses, our focus was to HOLD. Let us regain our focus gentleman, we are the smoothest brained of them all, our wives more desired than any from any lands. We are retards, not idiots. It is time we Hold, that we fortify the fortress, that we await future dips and bigger imminent gains. But more importantly, it is time for real DD. Melvin is spent, his anus agape. Recent injections won‚Äôt change the damage done, nor the everlasting repercussions in his anal cavity. We must fuck the market in its entirety, and point out the stocks we LIKE , to the rest of our brothers and sisters .

Edit: Any word from the mods on these news?

TW. (have to censor some words to get the post to go through) I was having major d pressive episodes and suicid l contemplations last week when I heard about this sub and found a new community that actually brought me some joy and that I looked forward to each day. I hope the mods realize that by screwing this sub, they‚Äôre ruining this entire movement with gme and therefore a lot of people‚Äôs lives. I really hope nobody does what I wanted to last week after seeing their huge financial losses due to this community being hijacked.   if so, the blood is on the mod‚Äôs hands and I have no idea how they could sleep at night. but I‚Äôll continue to pray for troubled souls such as theirs.

Will WSB Ever Be The Same? Or Am I Crazy?
I want to ask the obvious but much-needed question. Is WSB dying? I've been on this sub since back when it had two mil if I remember correctly, and due to the meme stock hype and the media coverage, we've hit   mil in the blink of an eye. This is made mostly up of an influx of newbies and bots spamming about "RH BAD!" and "HOLD GME. APE STRONG!" with way too many emojis. I understand all the hype and am okay with the new members, but will this ultimately lead to our downfall? I just wanted to gather some opinions from other retards like myself, and I also wanted to partly address the FUD. The past few days have been rough for all of us. Are we holding the bag? Are we going to the moon? We've all been fighting with our inner instincts to trust the numbers and do the research, but I think for most of us, Friday is the determining factor. I've lost enough, so there's no point in selling now. I know this has gotten off-track, but it's time we retards take some time to reflect. I love all of you retards. Pray for coming of the tendie-man and dream of the moon landing. Godspeed.

I'm bout' to get down and dirty with my little secret $GME love affair for a New York Minute cuz dat blue-ballin', hard to get GAME playin', closet freak almost-tangible fantasy that I just want to marry and live happily ever after on forever fairytale Disney vibes.
AUTISTIC DISCLAIMER:    I'll make this quick seeing as   of you retards don't even bother to read long posts.    Lots of controversy in the whispers right now from all angles of one's view, as to who is/was guilty of allegedly, illegal stock manipulation manuvers.   My opinion, of which I will not express publicy, has been decided.   I have chosen to accept the fact that my soulmate and   soon-to-be  tied-knot spouse was publicly ripped out of my arms in order to be repeatedly gang-raped in front of the world to see while I stared helplessly through the window of uncertainty...   However, a significant amount up superstitious people support the merciless karma that is due to return back is   you know...  Bittersweet. minus the bitter and triple the sweetness.   Furthermore, I will not disclose my current or past position, if at all, in GME.    I would like to keep my stance on this globally, highly involved world-wide ride as neutral as possible as the fate of my marriage hangs in the balance of statistics + basic math +/- patience = to experience true, forever-freedom to live one's life to the fullest with no more shackles on my life the very select few to have ever have lived on this planet with an equal opportunity to mature into a self respected, Human.

With a short float over 50% it‚Äôs one of the most shorted plays out there. That being said, there are so many catalysts to turn it into a short-squeeze time bomb. Safe Act and Apha Merger definitely being the primary ones over the next few weeks. What do you guys think?

The media has been adamantly spreading false information and has been putting down our beloved ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stocks... this is a good thing.
The media is destroying and trying to completely discredit us, and our beloved stocks.   As long as they continue, we don‚Äôt need to know the short interest THE MEDIA IS GIVING US THE EXACT NUMBERS.   #IF THEYVE COVERED AND ARE HAPPY THEY WOULD STOP PAYING THE MEDIA TO SLANDER OUR COMPANIES.   It‚Äôs that simple. I can smell the hedge funds fear and so can you. Until the media quiets down (they‚Äôve only gotten louder), we have nothing to worry about      TLDR  the media slander is proof that the shorts haven‚Äôt covered. We should only be fearful when the paid media is quiet, until then, the hedge funds fear means that we are winning.
GME: Looking at Some Data!
Let's look at some charts again and try to figure out what went on today. Before that, I just want to make sure people understand that I'm just looking at some data and \ guessing\  what is happening. I do that mainly for myself because I don't fully trust anyone's judgment and I want to be in charge of my decisions. I could be wrong! I think you should do to same: try to gather as much information as possible, process that information, and make up your mind! If you lose money this way (instead of following people blindly), at least you learn from your mistakes.  Let's jump into it: Based on the position-cost distribution from today (from Webull), I see that   happened again: there was a decent amount of shares added to the float, take a look:     Today's change, however, is slightly different: as you can see, it looks like a relatively small amount of shares went from below $92 to above it. This could be due to either some profit-taking, day-trading, or scalping.  Note that stock price went up but "Total Profited Shares Proportion" is slightly down because of both of these (short selling as soon as price went up, and some profit-taking/day trading/scalping). I personally think that the bigger pattern is the new shares that seem to be added to the float and there has been a lot of short selling activity in the past two days:     Where are they getting these shares from? I have no idea!  Another thing that keeps happening (I posted about it   was probably wrong because today I saw this:     As well as this:     So if anyone has a plausible explanation for these weird orders, please let me know!  PS. There are massive open interests on both put and call options that expire this Friday, so things might get extremely volatile again!       Disclaimer: I'm not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise! I've been long GME and have a lot of GME shares and a few GME call options    EDIT: TLDR; It seems like today:  ü¶ß mostly did        attacked

CHAMATH HAS SPOKEN
US Marijuana Legalization: the next rocket catalyst
Bubbles   An emergence of a new industry usually results in a bubble due to the necessity of making a lot of assumptions about future growth to value a stock since there is no historical precedent. The enthusiasm for a paradigm shift causes investors to frequently overshoot and result in what may be quite astronomical valuations. Currently, the US equities market is quite frothy with unprecedented loose monetary policy causing an asset bubble of historic proportions. Jeremy Graham calls the US equities the biggest bubble he has ever seen in his investing career.  With the Democrats in charge of government, the corresponding stimulus bill will result in a melt up of the stock market along with risky equities.     Government Involvement    Government policy and actions can ignite a bubble. Chinese EV stocks were in the dumps during March 2020 due to the Covid shut downs, and the curtailment by the Chinese government of EV subsidies. NIO was on the verge of bankruptcy with only having enough cash to sustain its payrolls for 2 months at the time. But the subsequent 180 from the government for EV subsidies along with a partnership with a local government entity caused NIO to skyrocket.   We are already in an environment of risk seeking, frothy environment where a value play of a struggling retailer can turn into a short squeeze that ends up as a social moment. This is a crazy market, and it will get even crazier when Congress legalizes marijuana.  US marijuana legalization efforts has followed a similar path to gay marriage where the public opinion over the decade has shifted due to states leading the way for legalization followed by an increasingly favorable depiction in popular culture that has shifted public opinion. I believe we are on the verge of legalization now that the Democrats hold all positions of power in government, and they are willing to pass progressive policies after getting stung in the Obama administration for trying to negotiate a ‚Äúbipartisan‚Äù path that went nowhere.      Political Calculus   The House has already passed HR 3884 MORE Act of 2020 that pretty much legalized marijuana. Schumer who is the current Senate Majority Leader, sponsored the S 1552 Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act in 2019, but it went nowhere since McConnell ran the show at the time. Legal marijuana is Schumer‚Äôs pet legislation he has been pushing for years, and he is under pressure to enact progressive legislation due to threats of other progressives running against him in the 2022 primary. He will most likely push to get it passed in the Senate before his primary so that he can parade it in his re-election   and kill any progressive challenges to his seat.   Marijuana stocks have done well since the election, but I think they have more room to go due to the following reasons. Once legalization happens, a couple of things happen.   1.      Institutional money.   US banks and institutional investors cannot invest in a company that produces a product that is federally illegal. However, once legalization happens, the barrier no longer applies. You will have a flood of institutional funds buying up companies operating in a grey zone (hence my preference for US based MSOs compared to more mainstream Canadian companies).   2.	  Taxes.   Currently, IRS does not allow medical marijuana companies to deduct their business expenses so most of them are operating at a loss despite 50-70% gross margin. Once marijuana is legalized, their tax bill will no longer cause them to operate at a loss.   3.	  Availability.   US MSO who have the biggest to gain from this are trading in Canadian stock exchanges in a quasi-grey area. Once they become legalized, they can move into main stream stock exchanges like NYSE which can open them up to retail investors to trade in.   4.	  Financing.   The best US MSO can only get a 10% rate for their financing needs in order to expand due to the lack of banks willing to do business with them because of the ambiguity in the federal guidelines. When the restriction is lifted, their financing costs will go down and their payment processing fees/ availability will improve.   TLDR- US based weed stocks going to the moon. Diamond hands for tendies.

How WSB thinks it happened:
All of you complaining about bots and paid shills should welcome the SEC to the party
I just read a pretty good (many words) write up from a former SEC internet enforcement chief, and I see nothing but positive outcomes here.  We have nothing to hide and have been entirely open and transperent, as has been extensively reported.     Those who we believe have spent the last several weeks invading our happy place with false and misleading claims on the other hand, they have some serious shit to hide if true.  This is an actual crime, and I believe the actual reason for the SEC to rightly be here investigating.  We are on the right side of history here folks, and karma is a bitch for those who aren't.  (Check your own sources, I'm just sharing what I read)

Hey SEC guy monitoring this forum..
Friggin what up dude do you like my username? I don't even own GameStop or believe in the trade... I don't even like this subreddit I just go here to gawk at how dull the users are lmao. I just wanna talk to SEC guy. How's it going? What's a gig at the SEC like? Before covid, what was the office vibe like? Did y'all get like good snacks in the break room (uggg one of these losers is going to make a tendies joke its overplayed). But what was the break room dealio at the SEC? Anyways I hope you see some wild shit it's a god damn carnival around here,  ain't it?!  Have a good day!!
WSB Control Room
Don't trade on margin if you want to have diamond hands
Margin is alluring because it gives you control of money you do not have. But keep in mind that you are borrowing money from your broker with interest, and the broker will liquidate your position if you fall below a threshold,  , 33%, 50%, etc., depending on your broker. If you are margin called, some brokers will call you and give you time to add additional funds (which you may not have) or liquidate your positions before they are force liquidated. However, if you look into the contractual language between you and your broker, they are NOT obligated to give you a heads up. Moreover, given that they are likely bombarded right now, and probably have an incentive to liquidate your positions, they are mostly likely allowed to manually liquidate your position,  , your GME long positions. You cannot diamond hand a position that is manually liquidated by your broker.   Some of you may say that you cant even go on margin on GME. That is true for some brokers. If you want to trade GME, don't go on margin trying to trade any other equity. Do not give your broker a chance to liquidate your positions.      \ I have never held nor do I intend to ever hold any long or short position in GME.

This is my individual opinion and does not reflect the opinion of the subreddit  /r/wallstreetbets     Hey guys, since I really do not like robinhood, when it IPOs i'm gonna buy puts on it!

If you Buy Puts on Robinhood, I wish you the best and I hope you are able to make money from your Puts on Robinhood.

Mysterious activity in $BB ? Acquisition ?

While the information provided is believed to be accurate, it may include errors or inaccuracies. Furthermore, this is only my thoughts, so none of this should be considered financial advice.)    I will highlight why I think BlackBerry is in the middle of an acquisition, I will provide facts but also my own opinion. So please do your own DD, and make your own thoughts about it.        39m shares   have been bought/sold in blocks since the 28th of December. I have no way to see if these are only buys or also sells. These block trades have happened no matter the SP. The biggest block was over $70m. (Can someone confirm if this is buy orders?)    Source:        Furthermore, there's a lot of options activity going on 19th of Feb. These options are unrealistic without anything huge should happen. The biggest one was a $500k $38 call strikes for the 19th of Feb.         If you compare these with the week before or the week after you will see that there's A LOT more call option activity for the 19th of Feb.        More evidence:        John Chen will get a big bonus if the stock hits $30. This correlates perfectly with the relative high call options activity above $30.   What about other events that could trigger a high amount of call options? We have the Facebook settlement. But that still doesn't explain the big block trades.      The institutional ownership has also increased from around 49% last month to almost 66%.      Who could be the buyer you might ask? Well since Amazon and BlackBerry have a pretty huge partnership, I would assume they could be the buyer.         \                          --    Conclusion:   If BlackBerry were to be acquired I would think the offer would be around $35-50 a share. I would think this could happen before the 19th of Feb, because of the call options activity. Imagine if they actually are in an Acquisition and /WSB just made them pay a huge premium cuz of the pump? GG's   \ Please make your own thoughts about this and share it below in the comments, I could be wrong and would love to see more opinions about it.

Part 4 - $BB No Meems (plus $GME $AMC $NOK) - Ties that Bind
Welcome to the continuation of this incoherent tirade.   linked.   $BB went up today. Is that good for $BB investors & bagholders? Yes, you grunt, drooling onto your weighted blanket. But axchuaallly‚Ä¶  I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just a retard but I think the answer is sort of, only maybe.   I updated my chart from yesterday. As we in the $BB gang already know, $BB's a  s. If you even look @ the price anymore you're a puss looking at prices are for paper hands.   But look at this fucking thing.           Look at the correlation.   For the smooth brains ‚Äì you might think yeah no shit those are the most common tickers on reddit so what.   So WHatt??? This is a weird thing!!!!   There is no      fundamental      (yes many of you don't have that word in your vocab idc bite me) reason   for these stocks to trade tegoether.  Why the fuck would an Endpoint security company, a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider trade in tandem other than just being meme stocks?    Re: the downwards movement, my hypothesis was  s - $BANG was the most commonly held basket in RobinHood accounts this past few weeks and dips get exacerbated by margin calls .  But‚Ä¶  goes down must also go up. Said another way ‚Äì What‚Äôs causing correlation on the upswings as well?   Why would buyers of $BB today also be buying a     , a vidya retailer, a movie chain, and some Fininsh 5(g) provider    ,  especially after the loss porn of the past few days?   And especially since the front page has been dominated almost entirely by $GME / $AMC ?      BTW the reason some of the $BB GANG want a conscious decoupling (it's not  's us) from the memes (fuck the memes) is so that people can realize the true fundamental value of Papa Chen‚Äôs Cyber Co. vs. the continual austistic screeching about Janet Yellin and Melvin (newsflash Melvin got the fuck out already)   Anyways ‚Äì So the question is sure, initially some retards bought the whole $BANG before $GME blasted off, but why is that still holding true? My theory, having a number of acquaintances @ hedge funds (no none of them Melvin fuck you)  is - yesit‚Äôs WSB‚Äôs favoriate bogeyman - those very same hedge funds.   As   as he verbally tore CNBC a new asshoe, hedgies may wear infinitely finer suits and sport cleaner underwear but they chase the very same tendies. The dirty little scecret is a big part of what they do is   momentum chasing   ‚Äì Buying what goes up and selling what goes down.   Those initial shackles binding $BANG were the idiots here (including me) who bought $BANG in various combinations. But now those shackles are wrapped in   $BILLIONS$   of load-bearing momentum strategies. Long shorts funds. Market neutral funds. And, perhaps    most hilariously   , the   with Harvard PhD-designed models that probably ‚Äì accidentally - now have a meme basket that they trade, punting on shares of $BB, $NOK, $AMC, and $GME like the most retarded amongst us.   # TLDR ‚Äì I LIKE $BB MID AND LONG TERM, AND EVENTUALLY IT NEEDS TO DECOUPLE FROM $BANG TO ACHIEVE TRUE GREATNESS. BUT IN THE SHORT TERM I AM PRAYING TO CHEETO JESUS FOR YOU $GME / $AMC /$NOK BROTHERS ‚Äì FOR BETTER OR WORSE WE'RE ALL BONDED TIGHER THAN     PS If I were less of a retard I might try to design an option spread to take advantage of the (1) $BANG correlation and (2) the fact that $BB and $NOK swings are more muted. There‚Äôs $$$ to be made there I think some of you smart options monkeys figure that one out. Other interesting ways to make $$$   - Betting on what tickers (Tootsie roll gang anyone? Fuck that one lost me a lot of $$) become meme stocks and drop out of being a meme stock    Disclaimer I'm balls deep in $BB and am a retard who just likes the stock do your own research

Just to clear up the SEC probe misunderstandings
So I think we should all be clear that the SEC is investigating whether institutional influence happened in this sub.   They don‚Äôt give a shit whether some 19 year old yolod his allowance on   shares of GME.   They want to know whether other hedge funds might‚Äôve manipulated this sub into buying/selling/ whatever in their interest.      This is described in the sentance - ‚Äúmay in fact have been professional investors looking to capitalize on the forum‚Äôs fervor‚Äù  I know everyone here  thinks  that WSB is in charge but in reality- there are large institutions both long and short on this play. WSB is basically a toddler sitting at the World Series of poker table.

Now is the time
Listen up fellow  .  Now is the time to buy and here‚Äôs why. Since Jan 26th this hasn‚Äôt been about investing. It‚Äôs been about trading. It‚Äôs a simple supply and demand. We took the supply and they have a demand.  Some questionably legal practices have left us wondering about the reality of the situation.   But today‚Äôs $GME news changed some things. Our favorite business is changing focus to e-commerce and new senior management appointees spell a new direction.  Since several of the big name appointees come from Chewy, it‚Äôs reasonable to draw comparison between businesses. It also makes sense based on probable business model.   $CHEWY closed today at $  and is considered a solid buy with room to grow. It‚Äôs mostly online and delivers pet food to your front door. The average cost of dog food is $500 per year per dog. There are   million dog owners in the US.    million ppl x   avg dogs x $500 = $   $GME closed today at $  and is starting transition to mostly online and delivering games to your front door or straight to your PC. The average gamer spends $  per year. There are 200 million gamers in America (including mobile games - so granny playing candy crush counts). 200 million ppl x $  = $   Plus, GME just got global attention. They already have stores in Europe, Australia, and NZ.  Shipping an 8oz video game case or a delivering a digital license around the world is a easier than shipping physical bags of dog food from the US.   At the current price, anything below $100 of GME is now a viable long term investment over several years. If GME achieves Chewy levels of  success in e-commerce those sub $100 shares are right back on par with average investments. Plus there‚Äôs still the upside of forming a squeeze.  This should be right about the bottom. The  ü§≤üèΩ losers who hoped on the hype-train late have fled. The wise money should be buying back in. Calls are dirt cheap too.     ü§≤üèΩü§≤üèΩ forever. 10 GME @ avg $180 $800c 2/19       This is not financial advice. Just random headaches with pictures turned into words.

Earnings for the week Start 2/1 with Short Squeeze Potential (Mid-Week Update)
Good evening everyone,     As some of you may have seen, on Sunday night I posted a chart for earnings this week (2/1) with somewhat higher short squeeze potential. I have decided to provide a mid-week update. To do this, I took the most recent closing price and subtracted it from the next closing price. So if a company reported earnings in the morning, I took the closing price from the day before, and the closing price from the day the earnings was reported, and converted into a daily change (which will be shown in the chart as well). With out further delay, here are the current results:  Date Ticker % Short DTC Beat EPS Beat rev % Change   --  --  --  --              2/1 ON   4.302096178 Yes Yes   2/2 HOG   10.30508475 No No   2/2 MPC   5.912310287 Yes Yes   2/2 SALT   5.619991505 No Yes   2/2 LITE   3.365979381 Yes No   2/2 LFVN   7.007714561 Yes No   2/2 FEYE   3.217162872 Yes Yes   2/3 LGND   4.882926829 Yes yes   2/3 CHKP   6.668711656 yes yes   2/3 TTMI   12.03571429 Yes Yes     2/3 GRUB   12.24576271 No No         These two are too early to tell the official outcome, but as of the time of writing both had reported earnings, and that was their current price change.  For the remainder of the week, your earnings calendar looks like this:  Date Ticker % Short DTC  --  --  --  -- 2/4 NYT     2/4 VSTO     2/4 PTEN     2/4 CLX     2/4 PENN     2/4 RGS     2/4 MSGN 17   2/4 SBH     2/4 WYNN     2/4 BILL     2/4 TDC     2/4 WWE     2/4 ZEN     2/5 AON      I will aim to post the calendar for this upcoming week on Sunday, around 1 EST.  original post:    Happy Hunting!

Stock Market   [an idea]
After participating in the GME bloodletting, I've come up with a brilliant \[maybe\] idea.  What if we created our own block-based stock market for startups. \[can't write the whole block part out because the bots auto-delete the post\]  All transactions would be strictly enforced due to the block based ledger, and all transactions would be permanently recorded.  Therefore any shady trading activity would be publicly viewable, and no-one could control access to trading itself.  A Stock Market by the people, for the people.  No Brokers. Direct Trades. Public Ledger  Anyone else think this is a good idea?  EDIT: this is snowballing - we're discussing details in a subreddit - pm if you are serious about joining

$TAKOF - Drone Delivery Canada DD
tl;dr: $ TAKOF  is taking off and going places. Rockets (or batteries) have been fueled ‚Äì up we go! I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.  (  Sources in comments  )  Longer version  My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, green revolution, retail industry tendencies). Today I‚Äôll share my opinion about future of deliveries.  For quite a while there has been a buzz around drone deliveries. Be it Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward, DHL Parcelcopter (my favorite because of this ridiculous name), Boeing‚Äôs Matternet‚Ä¶ Everyone with the capacity to is trying to jump on this ship. You can read more about latest developments and companies working in Source 1.  Why there‚Äôs such race to develop unmanned cargo air vehicles and autonomous flight technology you might ask? Well, drone doesn‚Äôt get sick, can workday and night, it doesn‚Äôt have to take breaks or spend half of it‚Äôs time chatting around or staring at its phone. It also doesn‚Äôt need any contributions to its pension fund or healthcare insurance (needs insurance nevertheless, but technical insurances should come at much better rate than insuring a ball of flesh against all that world could throw at it). Finally, drones don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs pandemic raging outside or boogaloo boys are stepping on the grass around some government building.  Drone comes off for the buyer as a one-time purchase cost, thus saving loads of cash in the lung run. Many businesses are taking more ‚Äògreen‚Äô approach to their business and calculate their CO2 footprint. Given that drones are powered by electricity (all the attention to the renewable energy, wink wink) it would also help business to boast about reducing carbon footprint while improving their efficiency.  One might think of one issue here: drones are cool and stuff, but what about the battery - it might not be able to cover required distance? Worry not, there are already solutions for this. Mainly ultra-fast charging stations (charge time: 5 minutes) or wireless charging hotspots (charge time: 6 minutes). Check out Source 2 and Source 3.  All in all I believe that drones have a bright future ahead of them and $ TAKOF  is one of the players in this industry.    Company  : Founded in 2014, Drone Delivery Canada has developed a proprietary and patented turnkey drone delivery solution. The company is fully commercialized, operational, and revenue generating.  DDC has developed a drone delivery platform solution which is cost effective, highly scalable and can provide next generation logistic services to various market sectors including: retail, ecommerce, parcel & post, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil & gas, logistics companies, Indigenous Communities, military and government agencies, in Canada and internationally. The Company‚Äôs patented, fully integrated hardware/software platform is used as a managed service in a SaaS business model. Drone Delivery Canada is fully commercialized, operational and revenue-generating, with a robust sales funnel of global prospects.    So far, the company has signed test flight agreements with several major corporations. A medical facility in Ontario, two remote First Nations communities in the same province, GlobalMedic, and Air Canada have all agreed to test the company‚Äôs drones. Last year, it also struck a partnership with European logistics/transport group DSV Panalpina A/S.    Latest Catalysts  : Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX¬Æ Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)    Upcoming Catalysts  : release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market ‚Äì at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.    Industry Catalyst  : establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.  Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7 ‚Äì claims $ TAKOF  has multi-bagger also discusses $ TAKOF  cash position).        I saw following stock valuation, but can‚Äôt find source for it:       Summary  : $ TAKOF  is ready for a take off! It‚Äôs literally in their name. 3 rockets.  Seriously, given all the craziness in the current market I wouldn‚Äôt rule out this reaching $10 in the next months. Especially if expansion to US is confirmed.  My position: 1k shares at $   That‚Äôs it. Now do your own DD. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice.

So what's the plan for the next helicopter money attack?
I assume next time we get helicopter money were going to find something to short squeeze on again right?
If you‚Äôre here to tell people to sell, FUCK OFF. Paper handed cunts aren‚Äôt welcome  ü§≤üèº
STOP telling people to sell you brainless assholes. Regardless of whether or not you think GME is dead, why the fuck would anyone sell in the red when they could so easily make profit if everyone just has some fucking balls?   Also, it‚Äôs not all about the profit for some people! I‚Äôve not got much in GME, but I‚Äôm absolutely willing to lose it if it means giving the hedgies even more of a headache that we already have.

Enough about GME and AMC! ITS OVER!!
Seriously. Time to move on. Get out and reduce your exposure if you bought in at the squeeze.  Let's come back down to Earth. Stop spreading misinformation, this is having real impact on people's lives. This isn't some conspiracy theory.  There is no squeeze coming. Invest for long holds if you really believe in this thing. If not, you need to get out.
Why are we still talking about Robinhood? Change broker.
I mean seriously... Why would anyone use them for anything except holding already bought positions? Why does anyone care that they so GENEROUSLY allowed the uncultivated swine to buy a little more shares?  Get a broker that got the funds.  In Mark Cubans AMA he kept repeating that we should find a broker that can handle these fights.  I'm hearing VANGUARD, FIDELITY, SCHWAB AND ~~TD AMERITRADE~~ for US.   From the AMA    "Pick the brokerage with the strongest balance sheet.      What ruined it on RH is that they didnt have enough cash      to deal with the growth in accounts, margin loans and volatility.      The EXACT SAME THING will happen at the next broker      if you dont make sure they have a MULTI-TRILLION dollar balance sheet to be able to handle these kind of circumstances"    ...    "That said, you will do all this again. You will go after WS and the      next time you will be smarter.      There was only      one thing that messed you all up   :   RobinHood and the other zero commission brokers that everyone used      didnt have enough       capital to fund the fight.      They let you down in a big way."    ...    "When you load back up, fight (find) a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on their balance sheet.      Someone that can be there when the fight starts      and wont blink an eye."    ...    "I know you are going to hate to hear this, but      the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again.      The only question is      what broker do you use.      Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the      same liquidity problems over and over again,      or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that      wont cut you off      and then go ham on Wall Street."    ...    "next time WSB will be smarter. And next time can still be around GME, AMC, etc"    ...    "Then hit them again, at a broker with the financial strength to never have to shut you off"    And of course:    "If you can afford to hold the stock,      you hold."      ‚û°Ô∏è üçë   237 bananas come get 'em

I don't think GME is over and I'm a pessimist
\- Roaring Kitty hasn't sold   \- the company released objectively positive PR  \- a phenomenon this frenzied and fanatical is unlikely to see just one surge, like people are just going to suddenly forget what GME stood for and the incredible tendies they could have made?  \- the movement was artificially suppressed by brokers and that's just unfair
The Real Value Behind GME (In-Depth DD)
LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons).  Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough.  When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward.  Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle.  We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth.  Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop.  Most recently were the adds today. Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.  Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock.  But what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions about $300k in GME and another $250k more in cash waiting for a drop if it happens.  Obligatory                   üë©‚Äç
GME is Still Extremely Undervalued. Here are the Real Reasons Why
First we examine the 1m graph. Do you see the two mountain peaks? Good. Now we pivot over to the Himalayas. You can see Changste and Nirekha, just below Everest. We haven‚Äôt even started that final ascent yet. And we‚Äôre climbing without oxygen tanks.  Next. Say it out loud. GME -> GHB. Yup that one. Melvin. Citadel. RH. Who knows who else be slipping it in our drink. But we ain‚Äôt bending over. We need to remember everything. Everything they‚Äôve done to keep us down. And they ain‚Äôt off our back yet.   Volume.   today. 60 day avg   Almost double. Why‚Äôs the volume so high? This is a party. People like to listen to loud music. That‚Äôs an insanely high number of decibels. Put in your plugs (at least 2 but more is recommended). Tinnitus is not great.  Fundamentals. 69m shares outstanding. Yup. It‚Äôs one of those parties.   cap full of GHB. Walk up to a stranger baby like can I suck your tongue? 121% float snorted. 2,000% high and can‚Äôt even see the ground.  It lit. Everyone want in. Rumors flying. Dirty tricks everywhere. Snakes trying to lure us away and swallow us whole. Pigs trying to blow this house down. Don‚Äôt forget though. This is a movement. Not just the paper. Yo we gotta take the power back. And we about to shoot past the moon. Strap on your helmets retards.  üññüèº

Counterfeit Shares - And What We Should Be Doing RIGHT NOW
\ \ \ Disclaimer\ \ \    The following is entirely a work of fiction created by a retarded and autistic monkey who was left to pound away on a keyboard for a few hours. This monkey is neither a lawyer nor a financial advisor, and the following is not to be construed as financial or legal advice.   I will start first by saying: I‚Äôm new here, but the shit I‚Äôve seen the past few weeks has been mind blowing. Honestly, I was annoyed at first that people were trying to co-opt this into a direct battle with the HFs, and later into some kind of class warfare instead of just an educated bet that might let us snag a few juicy tendies from some fuckwits who shoved their hands way too far into a tiny cookie jar.         Posts and A Few Nitty-Gritty Additions    Many of you have seen the DD done by u/johnnydaggers       ‚Äôm a skeptical as fuck autist. I don‚Äôt just believe anything at a glance, and a lot of the information contained in the white paper ‚ÄúCounterfeiting Stock  ‚Äù doesn‚Äôt contain many links to the cited supporting documents or specific   that troubles the autist half of my brain. So I decided to at least spot check and zoom in on a detail that caught my eye.        ZOOM-- ENHANCE!    (See: Counterfeiting a Stock   - Part 6-  Why does this continue to happen?)    Both houses of the Utah legislature passed a bill that required daily disclosure of fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, including identifying specific companies and the specific broker dealer positions in that company. The bill also outlawed naked shorting of companies domiciled in Utah. The industry threatened litigation based upon federal preemption and backed the state down. The bill was not signed into law.   In February 2007 the SEC determined that the hedge fund industry did not require any additional regulation ‚Äî they are virtually unregulated. This may be the height of arrogance.  I searched for the specific bill the author mentioned in Utah. (For those of you who don‚Äôt know, you can look up all laws proposed and passed at the local, state, and federal level. They document all of this shit.) Well, I found it and read enough of it to satisfy my semi autistic brain:      For those of you who are less autistic than I am, here are the most important parts:    S    ummary       \                                     Narrowing of window to deliver securities to 24 hours as well as provide detailed information about the transaction:       \                                -    SUBSTANTIAL Penalties imposed on ALL parties responsible for a failure to deliver.       Here‚Äôs what the authors of the white paper got wrong though, the bill passed almost unanimously and WAS signed into law (    It seems they were bullied into doing this by SEC and SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). This is the first time I‚Äôve heard of this player in the game. They are an advocacy group supporting the rights of the securities industry (lol). They are staffed mostly by big players in the banking and securities industry. They are a ‚Äúnon-profit‚Äù with a CEO who is compensated almost $3 million/year. This number is from the CEO in 2012, I can‚Äôt for the life of me find any info on salaries after that date so I can only assume that it‚Äôs higher now. (info from:    Look at all of the cool things they are doing:            to the Self-Incriminating SEC doc    If you haven‚Äôt yet, look at this report below, read the first 3-5 pages at least. It‚Äôs an executive summary, published BY SEC, about counterfeiting shares and the roll it played in the financial crisis of 2006-2008.       THEY KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING. FUCKING READ THAT REPORT YOU FUCKING RETARDED AUTISTS. IT‚ÄôS PUBLISHED BY THE SEC AND SUGGESTS THAT WE MIGHT BE BUYING COUNTERFEIT SHARES THAT ARE BEING CONJURED INTO EXISTENCE RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR FACES.   OUR STRATEGY TO BUY AND HOLD IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING WE CAN DO, BUT WE MIGHT BE PUTTING SOME MONEY BACK IN THOSE FUCKERS POCKETS FOR THEM TO RELOAD. WE (retail investors) MIGHT OWN MORE SHARES THAN ARE EVEN SUPPOSED TO EXIST, NOT COUNTING WHAT OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER SHAREHOLDERS ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE.      FUCKING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE         does this mean??    If this is true, and as pervasive in the system as all of this shit suggests. They could be stealing billions, if not fucking TRILLIONS of dollars every year, at everyone else‚Äôs expense. When I say everyone, I mean fucking EVERYONE, the entire world economy revolves around the US market. The fraud here creates excess capital in the system that isn‚Äôt backed by any real securities,   inflation. Your money is worth less when these fucks start counterfeiting shares.     Explanation in retarded ape terms:  Let‚Äôs say you and your friends have 10      . You each paid one   üçó   (tendie) for each      . Each       is still worth 1   üçó   and you can trade it in at any time. (We‚Äôll assume that the value stays constant, doesn‚Äôt really matter if the price goes up and down for this example as it obviously would in the stock market). But uh oh! Here comes a      . He made 5 fake plastic       and he decides to sell them to you retarded apes. You each pay him about one tendie for each fake      . Now there is a larger supply of       than there should be! Let‚Äôs say in total that it cost you all 14   üçó   for all 15       (due to the reduction in price caused by the surplus       in the system). Mr.       slithers off with 4   üçó  !!! You and your friends now have 10 real      , 5 fake      , and you paid 14 whole   üçó   for them! Silly retarded apes. Oh, and since you and your dumb fuck friends can‚Äôt count at all, and/or lose count every 3 days, you have no fucking idea how many total       there are!         Else Can We Do Besides Staring At Tickers and Scrolling Through Memes?    So what do we do?   think the place to go now is to raise as much hell as we possibly can while we continue to     Ô∏è Ô∏è   . We shouldn't just sit around waiting for the Robinhood hearing. Fucking Feb. 18th?? My thought is that Robinhood might just end up being the fall guy; mostly a distraction from all of the other shit going on. It may have even been legitimately out of RH‚Äôs control to some extent. Vlad claimed that their clearing house suddenly demanded $3 billion more from them in collateral, leaving them scrambling. Meanwhile, the HFs are still up to their dirty tricks.   ALL of the responsible parties need to be investigated and held accountable. This could even include the NYSE itself, DTCC (for either clearing fraudulent transactions or failing to resolve the FTDs), Citadel, Melvin Capital, and SEC. Hopefully this would be done by a committee completely independent from SEC, maybe it would even be the DOJ. If the ‚Äúcounterfeit stock‚Äù theory is true, and actually, even if it is just good ol‚Äô fashioned market manipulation, then all of them, at every level are complicit in this. This isn‚Äôt an isolated case as others have pointed   are all trying to cover their asses here to ‚Äúprotect the integrity of the entire marketplace and the interests of investors.‚Äù Translation: fuck with it however they want, in whatever way benefits them and maintain the status quo.       CONTACT LEGISLATORS AND FILE COMPLAINTS WITH EVERYONE      Specific Entities to Contact or File Complaints With:    File complaints with:     NYSE:      SEC (for a paper trail if nothing else):      DOJ: (they may come into play if the SEC is investigated, they are also sometimes involved in investigations and prosecution related to the stock market. See: Michael Burry)     Contact your state governments. Senators, and congressmen/women!! There were more than a few states that tried to close the loopholes which allow the market manipulation we are currently witnessing.        Here is where you can find your senators and congressmen/women:             \ \ You‚Äôll need to just google to find your local state senators.     This comment is a great place to start for what to include in the email to your representatives. Remind them that they work for US.     You can also include a link to the SEC report for their reading pleasure:           Fucking REEEEEE at the top of your lungs, fellow retards and autists! We need to let them know what we need and  expect  from them.  To our   Ô∏è Ô∏è  friends in every part of the world: we need your help too! I believe many countries in Europe (and countries throughout the world) have systems in place which make FTDs impossible. Trades are completed instantly between parties so a security HAS to be delivered (their systems aren‚Äôt archaic, retarded, and easily exploited like ours). Join us in raising hell because this directly impacts you too. Your governments and the market infrastructures you have in place may give valuable data if we can get it. Contact your local governments and regulating bodies!       TL;DR    \- First of all, fuck you, that monkey spent a few hours researching and compiling this shit.   \- Specific details in ‚ÄúCounterfeiting Stock  ‚Äù verified. Lends a little more credibility to it imo.  \- We \ might\  be fueling some of the HFs ability to keep going in this fight by purchasing their counterfeit shares. But our best option is probably still to     Ô∏è Ô∏è    and buy the dips.  \- Open the floodgates! File Complaints, email your local and national reps, and reeeeee   Edit: Not sure what the deal is, but formatting is really fucked up on mobile. Possibly because I laundered the post through Google docs...
Just a hypothetical Q
if we, oops I meant, if the free market pushes $GME to $1000 a share... any idea how much Melvin would lose? or has he lost it all already?
Value is about perception, not a price tag.
Over time markets go up and they go down. Housing prices go up and they go down. Too often I see people stressing over what something is worth in dollars, rather than seeing the inherent value in the item itself.  When the housing market collapsed in 2008, people lost their minds because their homes were worth ‚Äúless‚Äù, but guess what, no one took the house away unless you sold it (for a loss) or stopped making payments and the bank foreclosed. If you just needed a place to live, and kept making payments, you kept the house, and over time, the market recovered and all that money that was ‚Äúlost‚Äù also came back.  Stuff has value beyond the paper value. Pay what you think it‚Äôs worth and be confident in your decisions. You will always live in regret if you worry about prices only going up. Because there are always times where they will go down. Do you check how much your car is worth every day? Do you care if you buy a refrigerator and then it goes on sale a week later? Do you sell all your watches and jewelry the moment gold prices start going down?  Make decisions with your money knowing that prices will ALWAYS fluctuate.  If you buy a   for $10, and then   goes on sale for $1, you still have a  . No one took your  . And if you like  , buy more  .  Not financial advice, just my perspective.

Completely neutral take on $GME
Okay okay okay, Jesus Christ you guys are like 5 year old siblings in the back of a 1999 Toyota Tacoma throwing blind punches while crammed in a 3 foot tiny square seat behind your dad's back titties.  Had to get that off my chest.  The animosity between bulls and bears on $GME lately is absolutely ridiculous.   BEARS  : It's not "how this sub always was" to completely shit on people for holding a position. Let them do whatever the fuck they want and anticipate the loss porn for breakfast the next day if you're so sure they're screwed. As long as you're ONLY dealing with money you have to lose, and not liquidating your ROTH to play a gamble, then you have every right to be here and invest like anybody else.    BULLS  : However, the number of people saying it'll still go to the moon and downvoting every opposite opinion they see is a huge issue. They know that this event will likely stay on people's minds  for years to come  \- especially with the different studios trying to capitalize on the situation and sentiments real time - but that does not mean much for the longevity of your play. Already this week we see that we're at a point where we can exhaust the capital from the people willing to invest and lose all of our money in the process.  I'm personally   bullish GME, 69 $GME@98  , and it sucked to see the whole squeeze kinda fizzle out and into what it is now. Even though I'm anal about it, I'm   \ not using emotions to dictate my investment\   . I truly believe in the value of Gamestop under Cohen and the new VPs they signed on today, and a tiny little part of me is still invested in the idea of a potential squeeze in the next few years that I'm still not selling.  Truly, we \ won't know for sure\  whether there's the potential for another squeeze, short or gamma,  . I've heard some say that it got delayed to the 15th but I haven't been able to find the source on this myself. Since the opinions on this are so binary, there will be \   \ no way of knowing whether this is all conspiracy or not\ \    until we have some guaranteed bonafide proof that the shorts   \ \ ARE OR ARE NOT\ \    in.  Until this point,  it is baseless to make a case about whether the squeeze is still on or not. Even the slightest confirmation towards the squeeze case will likely induce another gamma squeeze, since attention will be redirected toward a short-term high growth %; conversely, even the slightest vision that the shorts are out and we're sitting here floating in space will likely tank the stock with sales across the world - and definitely kill a conspiracy theory or two. The stock would likely only go back up when the  For this key reason, I think this situation is a 50/50 gamble. If you'd like to keep the gamble going, or feel like the losses aren't worth realizing, then fuck it. You do you. I hope you research opportunity costs related to bagholding and are willing to pay them as you move forward as an investor. If you're   \ not\    willing to take the gamble, then   \ don't\   , and stop dicking in the ass everybody who's willing to make a truly retarded play; after all, the spirit of this place isn't so black or white...    \ TL;DR we don't know what the fuck is going on, but it's your choice what you do with your money.

Etrade, InteractiveBrokers, maybe more? Can't connect to customer service
So, on Monday after have level 4 options trading for over 7 years I was moved to level 0.  I was on the phone for 2 hours Monday trying to reach somebody and got nowhere.  Can't get a single person on the phone or the online chat or secure messages either.  Apparently, people with Interactive brokers are experiencing the same type of shit.  Anybody else having a problem?  What the hell is going on right now?

Chargepoint Merger breakout
I‚Äôm gonna keep this short cause I‚Äôm fucking exhausted from these last two weeks of GME craziness. (Btw    don‚Äôt worry bitches).   Anyways.... Switchback Energy is a SPAC that a lot of you I‚Äôm sure have seen before. They are merging with Chargepoint.  This got postponed once and is supposed to happen this month sometime now. Chargepoint is the biggest ev charging company in existence. Chargepoint is bigger and worth more than blink even though Blink is priced higher and showing more market cap than SBE which won‚Äôt be right for long.   As we all know, EV‚Äôs are booming and are the future. Chargepoint is only going to grow more and more. They‚Äôre the biggest ev charging company by far.   I‚Äôm willing to put my money on the price of SBE going up quite a bit following the merger. It‚Äôs a pretty damn safe bet. And this is also a very great Looooooong position in my opinion as well. I‚Äôm going to snag some shares in the am as well as some more 40$ calls expiring march 19. I already hold 5 contracts but plan to buy 10-20 more and a grip of shares.   TLDR: SBE merging with chargepoint this month hopefully. Chargepoint is big company worth a lot and growing. Great long position. Should pop off soon.   THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. FUCK OFF SEC. I LIKE THIS STOCK AND I BELIEVE IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE COMPANY.   Positions: 5 40$ 3/19 calls.  Buying a grip of shares tomorrow morning and a lot more march calls and also 1/22 calls.
Retard here reporting for duty
Get off Robinhood and go?
Ok, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one here who knows almost nothing about stonks, and basically wanders in the dark until they hit a wall or roll down the stairs.  Im sure I‚Äôm not the only one who lurks WSB and have been thinking this so I‚Äôll ask. Where do we go other then Robinhood.  I‚Äôm sure most of us started using RB because we didn‚Äôt know how to trade stocks or even how to invest. Robinhood is easy to use and best of all FREE. So where should we go that is as user friendly and most importantly free to use?
I calculated how many times we freaked out about the squoze
From a retard that likes crunching numbers, at the peak last Wednesday, GME was mentioned around   million times on this sub.  In the same time period, NOK was mentioned 487K times, AMC 222K, BB 66K.  Add up these numbers and set it as your sell limit, or don't. I'm just a kid behind a computer.                    Dear SEC intern, leave Reddit and go investigate some institutions for a change.
Let‚Äôs flood the sub with dick pics for the SEC to look at for a couple days.
You go first.
I'm Having A Great Time
Hey All, first time investor here. Before last week I would've never thought about investing until I saw Reddit explode over this.   I think it's fantastic that a loophole for regular people, has been found. Regular folks that have 1 or more jobs to keep food on the table are the ones keeping the trains running on time, not the wealthy elites. It's mind blowing to think that middle and lower class folks think life simply has to be this way. I think it's bullshit.   I'm having a blast reading the posts and proud of being apart of something life changing for many regular folks in this sub and joining in the good fight.   I got my $500 in this fight! HOLD THE LINE!!

Read this book
The fat fucks with top hats in the 20's told the people at the bucket shop to tell the other people at the other bucket shop that they should keep an eye out for cotton and close their short positions on railroad stock. Of course they fabricated ups and downs and profited from it. The dope fueled knuckleheads from the 80's did it over the phone. And the degenerates from the 21st century changed the game by instantly sharing information that was accessible to an unlimited amount of unknown soldiers with a couple thousand bucks and undeniable math behind their initiative.
It's kind of scary watching something you loved for being small and largely unknown explode into 8+ Million users
I feel like an oldfag being here since 180K users, 4-5 years ago now, and I love that people more people are experience this nearly un-filtered weaponized autism, but it's so creepy knowing how many new users are bots, and that algorithms are scraping our comments for tickers to work against us    - WSB has the power to shift the market, but now it's the target for manipulation, and I dont know which I prefer. you?  - anyways, mods gay but god bless em for coming out on top of all this shit they're dealing with, newbies I recommend you just lurk for a bit to understand how this sub works, and GME till death n infamy
Not letting go, who's still holding?
Are you invested into $amc?? (be honest, share position if you'd like!)
Just curious as to who's really holding the line... I wanna see this stock squeeze to $35+ I think it has only just begun.
Losing money on the GME train? Here is why you should not lament.
Many made money with GME over the last month, but a few of you bought at the top, and although there is a good chance that this is not over, even if it were, you should feel proud of yourselves. Why? We exposed them. These hedge funds that have privileges that don't apply to us unwashed masses, like after hours trading. This system that is written by the billionaires, for the billionaires. A system of "market capitalism" and "bootstraps" that all of a sudden doesn't apply to the rich. It's all laid bare now, thanks to you and your diamond hands.  Even if they win this battle (which doesn't have to be, we can still win, and if you look at Melvin and Citron, in many ways we already have), we will win the war. We will make a system that is for all of us, not the. 01%. We will bring back the rule of law (The idea that the law applies equally to all of us. Funny thing, huh?).  Keep fighting. These aren't the only stocks they've shorted. Every you've time they short one, post it here. We have the numbers to fight back, just look at GME.  Autists forever!

IAMACADEMY??
What do y‚Äôall think about it honestly? I got referred by a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù aka my ‚ÄúMENTOR‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs a load of bs. They do these zoom calls ‚Äúmotivating‚Äù hyping you up (which they did hype me up), when I did have a question about something, my ‚Äúmentor‚Äù couldn‚Äôt help me, when I asked her mentor the same question and he responds with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start a zoom call doing basic trading.‚Äù  Which was a good call but i still didn‚Äôt get my question answered.  Also is MT5 frequent payouts?  I feel played honestly.
Short interest back up? And here I just like the stock
TLDR:  The short ratio spiked from the high teens to 25% today on low volume with no price movement. Ape scratch head. Ape tell ape friends.  Okay, clearly there has been a lot of weird info out there and it is hard to know what is what when it comes to just about anything related to GME (or anything related to last week). Quality information is hard to come by outside of you retards.  That being said, short interest Tuesday was up to 20% of traded shares from   Monday and an average of \~17% last week ( . I only have the brain capacity for two theories, and I'll happily take suggestions from the comments.  1. Shorts were all opened after the intraday peak around $108 to smack it back down to \~90. Given the all our posts are public information and we are clearly down to the diamond fuckin handers here, this seems a risky play for anyone that isn't already invested in the short side of this stock.   Confirmation bias: MOASS part 2 is still on.  EDIT: Turns out it is relatively cheap for massive firms to short right now (between 10 and 20% borrow fee), which furthers my idea that this was what happened.  2. Most of the shorts opened this time were smaller short positions opened by boomer retailers crazy enough to gamble on this stock returning to its  "fundamentals" (wtf are those?). These smaller short positions didn't flood the market fast enough to counter the ask slappers that believe in the MOASS's part 2.  The MOASS would have happened last Thursday. It's why we are pissed. It's criminal brokers interfered with the will of the people. It's insane how coordinated the misinformation that ensued was. Now it's personal. It ain't over ever. I continue to like this stock. Daddy Cohen's got a vision.  Disclaimer: I buy high and sell low, so what do I know. Nothing here is financial advice. That should be obvious by the fact I titled this "short interest" instead of "short volume"...  GME 45 @   Moon or bust. I'll probably keep buying the dips cause I've got double down syndrome.
Does this mean that they‚Äôre getting scared? More intimidation?
My holdings in $Nok $Gme $Bb $Amc. Any modifications I should make? Basically all my portfolio is divided in these stocks.

Does anyone think Blackberry stock will rise again? Saw some movement today just tryna decide to hold or cut my losses?? Anybody got any info? Are we over BB?? Or are we holding for more?
$GME has a MAJOR asset that's being   Geist of the Squeeze
(FROM THE HEART)  I started with 1 share at $350 so I could say I was here.  Now I got 15, aps $161.  I had no idea about the whole GME thing until last week.  I  bought the first share as a lotto ticket. The last two were the easiest shares I‚Äôve ever bought.  I hope the squeeze happens, but if not, I still consider this an investment I‚Äôm happy to make. And that‚Äôs how I consider it now, an Investment.  I bought a lotto ticket on GameStop stock, realized I own shares in this phenomenon called $GME, and bought more.  GameStop is the videogame store that the slowest, flakiest weed dealer in the Chicagoland area worked at back when I was in Highschool.  $GME? I can‚Äôt define $GME because right   is simply  beyond.   $GME is at the center of a movement that got support from AOC and Ted   THE SAME TIME IN 2021!!!!  $GME has been given the most aggressive, effective, and expansive advertising   in the history of   free. Communist dictators struggle getting the same amount of   their own regimes!  $GME has‚Ä¶  \-A fucking $NFLX movie already optioned!  \-Mass news coverage, worldwide, real or not.  \-The FUCKING INTERNET  \-The rocket emoji (WTF else could it be associated with now?)  \-Customers buying and donating $GME products to charity.  \-People buying Billboards, all over the world. A free street team for everywhere!  \-Peoples. $GME could have more than brand loyalty, it has the possibility to ‚Äúhave peoples.‚Äù Like Applefolk. I really hope they don‚Äôt fuck this up. I hope to continue being a fan.  \ \ \ \ And if there are any $GME Execs who think something like ‚ÄúWell I wouldn‚Äôt call that adverti‚Ä¶‚Äù Then my entire thesis is wrong. But after reading Ryan Cohen's letter to the Board, I‚Äôd be surprised that someone who thinks that way would still hold any position of influence at $GME.  $GME Has MONEY with VISION. Have you read Cohen‚Äôs letter? I think I read it once two days ago after seeing DFV mention it in one of his posts. I read it again earlier today, but this time after having read Cuban‚Äôs AMA. That was critical. Between Cohen‚Äôs letter and Cuban‚Äôs wisdom, something happened. I ACTUALLY- LIKE DEEP IN MY SOUL- BEGAN TO LIKE THE STOCK!!!  So I stopped trying to daytrade FD‚Äôs to average down shares, and took a more intentional look at $GME‚Äôs story and plan moving forward.  $GME should be so much more than a video game store, in the same way that McDonald‚Äôs is so much more than a fastfood restaurant. It‚Äôs like when Harry Sonneborn went to Ray Crock and was like ‚ÄúBro, you ain‚Äôt a restaurant owner, you‚Äôre a FUCKING REALESTATE MAGNATE!.‚Äù Ray didn‚Äôt know what he had... the template for a business that wouldn‚Äôt just disrupt the casual dining   would DEFINE it.  WHO THE FUCK IS THE MACDONALDS OF GAMING?!    $GME is in a position to wipe out EVERYONE in one of the fastest growing industries in the world. We don‚Äôt even know how the video gaming is going to mature as an industry yet, just that it‚Äôs gonna be bigger than it already is.  Cohen knows this, DFV knows this, any of you who have been truly following GME before the circus began prolly came to the same conclusion.  And Cuban knows this, but I think he saw something bigger.  Did anyone wonder why one of the most prolific and popular billionaires in the whole world might expose himself to possible legal or PR disaster, just so he can do an AMA on one of the most politically incorrect discussion forums on the net, at a time when it‚Äôs being watched like hawk by fin regulators? Not only that, afterwards, he goes on a PR crusade in support of WSB!!!  Why?   Because this is the place to be.    And this pushes all those assets and ideas listed above to whole new level.  There may be something WAAAAAAYYY bigger than a squeeze, a turn around, or even the advent of a gaming empire. Mass Media hysteria, AOC and Cruz agreeing, dogs and cats living together! There‚Äôs something bigger that‚Äôs possible, and I‚Äôm not sure Cuban even knows what it is, just that it‚Äôs BIG and since he‚Äôs Mark Fucking   made sure he was in it, but even more so, took a side and defended a   what? a bunch of tards chasing a squeeze? A chance to look cool in front of millennials? FUCK NO!  DOUBLE FUCK NO TO THE SECOND ONE!  We were all looking at charts, wondering what lines do, and scouring the sub looking for reassurance and more retarded DD, that I think we missed the value of $GME‚Äôs newest asset:    #GME fanatics and the Social and Cultural phenomenon they started.    What is the possible financial gain from the spirit (Geist) of the Squeeze ? I have no idea, but $GME is in a wholly unique and unprecedented position to find out. And this sparks joy and wonder in my soul.  I‚Äôm grateful to all the work DFV has done, but I'm also grateful he is no longer posting updates. The pressure on that man to   STILL IN, IM STILL IN? That‚Äôs the only comment for like the first 1k comments!!! It was to the point where actual lives could have been at stake if he didn‚Äôt post an update, let alone a stock price. Have you watched his vids? Have you seen how fucking chill and cool he is? It's insane to think about the weight he carried.  Nonetheless, I‚Äôm in because I like the stock. That‚Äôs it. But I like to think DFV has similar ideas to those explained above, and will continue to hold for the same reason. I also like to think there‚Äôs a few VC‚Äôs out there with similar thoughts. Maybe a few billionaires that are looking for something that can be truly Good and new.  Lastly, All of the radical and possibly delusional assumptions I made to come to this conclusion might be absolutely wrong.  TLDR: I actually like the stock.

AMC - Place a limit sale ?
I‚Äôve seen and read conflicting information about placing a limit sale with a ludicrous price to incur a gain if it‚Äôs bought.   My concern is that if I place a limit sale, I won‚Äôt be able to sell out until I cancel the limit or it expires.   Additionally I know that stocks can be lent ( I think ) to collect on interest.   If I place a limit sale, it is regarded as an open transaction and prevents buyback unless the set price is paid ?   Is this right or am I completely off base ?

HI - I like to take no for an answer
I have an idea for a meme for the meme war, point me in direction. Been holding AMC and GME. Became an actor because I love movies. Point me to the meme lord editors. :)

Sad Day for Retail Traders
One day you all will look back on this last week and wish you sold, I love the togetherness of the subreddit but nonetheless, these friends arent the ones paying your bills or taking your losses. Of course other people on the thread want you to hold if theyre holding. This will be a great lesson for all of you guys so atleast y‚Äôall have that!
Did GME short interest really go down?

Never bought a stock in my life until now. Down more than 50% but I‚Äôm still holding. DON‚ÄôT SELL HOLD THE LINE
The end of the journey.
Now with DFV stating that he isn‚Äôt going to be updating for the time being. On his side he must know that a large portion of this subreddit follow his footsteps (cause their retards) meaning that a lot of people are going to freak out and sell, so I‚Äôm assuming he is going to sell as well. I don‚Äôt see why he would publicly say that knowing the stock would crash and take a bigger loss.   I personally feel bad for DFV. Being the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of this subreddits new      cult following must be stressful and also horrifying. Also the government is now looking into him being the ring leader behind all of this even though he has months of detailed data proving that it was just luck...  Let‚Äôs say my assumption is true and he does cash out. I hope he gets past all of this and moves on to a better life. He has money to do whatever he wants and everyone wishes to travel the world and experience that lifestyle. My prayers go to him, his family, and future life.   We‚Äôve all learned a lot from this experience and wether you gained or loss‚Äôd.. I feel like we all have a DFV somewhere deep inside of us  The End.
HELP FOR A FEARED GME APE (ONE OF MANY PROBABLY)
Hi fellow apes, I invested 3000$ between Monday and Tuesday on $GME on the 200$ish, I didn‚Äôt invest money I would be broke if lost and it‚Äôs not money I earned working hard, but sitting on my desk checking my Broker account and seeing that 50%   me bad vibes, I‚Äôve a very bad clinical situation in my family right now with some cancer and a dying by illness parent, hopefully money is the only problem we don‚Äôt have right now. But still l, from today I started to feel also the pressure of the lost.   Also checking here the various posts I‚Äôm  noticing a downgrade of the good vibes given by diamond hands, the to the moon and all that nice newsporn and mathporn on our side.  And now I‚Äôm here to ask, can someone give me some words of wisdom to get my mind focused? Is there some good news that makes us think that we could still get to the moon? I‚Äôll hold surely cause there‚Äôs literally no reason to sell now, but there is still hope to see the stock over 150-200$? Is everything gone? Is something big still gonna happen?  Sorry for the drama in this but I really had to share this  feeling.

My first few days in the crusade: a current reflection
Hello comrades. New guy here.  So earlier this week I decided I wanted to join the crusade after seeing a meme saying that buying GME (and AMC, BB ect.) is a fantastic way   let's see I had the analogy written down somewhere... oh yes..   "forcibly bend over yonder hedgefucker heathen and shove a sexual instrument of excruciating proportion unlubricated into their rectal cavities in retribution for the same they rendered in 2008."  Being in a fiscal pickle myself, and a know-nothing on stocks besides, I decided to take out $25 dollars and start an investment account to play around with. Within a few hours I had acquiered my first AMC stock and 3 SNDL as they looked promising (at least for a few hours). I admittedly caved to fear, then simped back to getting one more SNDL. My accounts value dropped to $13.   This morning I put my big boy pants back on and took another AMC at 8 or so bucks and some other tech company who's ticker is banned (why?). I now lay my head down with $3 cash in the account and my account being valued at $17.  I'm being told I'm doing it right but all memes aside I'm hoping I am. Here's hoping AMC lifts off comrades!
Lost the little bit of gains I had buying into some stocks when the covid market happened. But, I'm still riding the wave with you big dumbs.

GoPro earnings yolo - 75 contracts - GPRO - Part 5
Final update.   Earnings are 2/4 after market close.   I will give my P/L Friday between open and close.     Mods flair me as "Went Pro" if I win or "Minor Leagues" if I lose.     This is a swing trade, expecting resistance near $12 (prev. high in September 2017) unless earnings  and  guidance absolutely crush (then look for $  as resistance).       Straddle pricing estimates an 17% swing up or down before end of week.   Wanna do the math on your jizz rag? Add the ATM weekly call price and the ATM weekly put price then divide that total by the ATM strike. Today at close we have approximately $  (call) + $  (put) = $  / $  (close price) =                         Positions:  GPRO 2/19 C $10 x 75 @    GPRO 2/26 C $11 x 75 @    GPRO 3/5 C $12 x 75 @          EDIT (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ TO THE END):     If anyone is going to jump in on this trade please look up   IV crush  . Basically Implied volatility (IV) serves as a multiplier for option values. An options value can increase without the underlying stock moving a penny if IV spikes. Also, an options value can decrease if IV falls (aka IV crush). This happened yesterday on 2/2/2021 when GME fell $140 - every put bought the previous day on 2/1/2021  lost  value even though the stock dropped by >60%.

WattUp everyone, this will be my first DD so hop on the short bus, strap on your helmet, and enjoy the ride.   Ape TLDR at the bottom you smooth brains  While researching batteries, I came across a corporation by the name of Energous (WATT). They are the leading the charge in a phenomenon called over-the-air wireless charging. Aka charging small electronics without needing to be contact with a surface or corded power supply, instead the device is charged by an RF transmitter.  Their primary product is called WattUp, the RF transmitters that allow them to charge devices over a frequency with a variety of applications - drones, medical devices, laptops, etc.  They have recently partnered with NewSound in December and received FCC approval for a WattUp enabled hearing aid, to eliminate the need to replace the small delicate batteries.  FCC approval for a WattUp enabled posture tracker.  They also have the first FCC permitted non-beam forming transmitter with a charging area of 1 meter, and a total of 230 patents as of Jan 2021.   Finally, as of Jan 5th, they have completed a $40m at-the-market equity offering.   This technology has incredible capabilities and could soon be found in any electronic device imaginable, and Energous is at the forefront.   Currently shares are at   from an all time high of   Currently both ITM and OTM options are pretty cheap with a nice average volume.

A rational (and bullish) take on the current state of GME gang
I see a lot of FUD and bad DD going around r/wallstreetbets, and its time for more rational discussions about the state of GME and the potential for another bull run. It is possible, but people need to stop being next level retard. It is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on what's actually going on. So while I don't know shit and this isn't real financial advice, here's a more rational take on what we need to do to get GME moving again.  Full disclosure: I was in GME in early December at around $15, I was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for Jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely. I got back in immediately for Feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k. I took some profits on the way up (I felt bad for doing so but I knew it was the big brain move, and in the end I pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me). I'm still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for Feb 19th, and made more 250 calls recently for Feb 26th and Feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday. I'm holding all of these till bust, so I'm in it to the moon. I have some shares too but those are a long play, I don't look at them.  First, we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done. The factors that led to it have changed, either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices (around 200 most likely), or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us. WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE ORIGINAL SHORT SQUEEZE TO REVIVE THIS STOCK. WHAT WE NEED IS AUTHENTIC BUYING AND NEW MOMENTUM.  On that note, stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume. What we need is real, authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200. But right now GME looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole. So how do we fix that? We still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the GLOBE that want a part in this once in a lifetime story. This is powerful but has to be used right, and that's hard when the brokers are shutting us out. But hope is not lost, and restrictions should lift over time. We need patience and resilience.  We also need to stop telling people who aren't in this for the moment to hold till they die. Some people are losing REAL money over this and we're being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies. Weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the FUD worse. If we want a come back we need the selling to stop, and that means we need to let the weak hands fold WHILE keeping the floor price above a certain level. Let's talk about volume. The recent 'low volume' isn't low compared to the past months, its just lower than the day when GME was THE MOST TRADED STOCK IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Stop talking about volume. REAL selling has happened, which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding. We need to let this energy run its course. Don't act like it's going to the moon and to buy at any price, save our bullets for the hard line in the sand.  Once the selling has stopped (and it will), we just need to regain momentum with organic buying.  People all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for GME to look like its picking up steam again and they will PILE THE FUCK ON just like last time. If we push the price high enough, we can trigger another short squeeze but it is NOT the same conditions as the first one. Stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks (which I've only heard of on this reddit) and us being cheated by the big man, that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable. It is STILL a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again, the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story. Whether it is or isn't, that only creates more FUD.  This sub needs to get its shit together. We need real authentic I LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK for reasons OTHER than the short squeeze. Like GME just adding a fucking Amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online. There is REAL REASON to believe in GME, and that needs to turn into authentic buying, which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again. But this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10,000 or bust needs to stop. It's just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief. This stock has real potential to hit $300+ again, we just have to change our mind set and the game plan. And I'm too stupid to tell you how, but I know this isn't the way. So buy the fuck out of GME at current levels, but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality. And tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going. We have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again, its not over. But its gonna require patience and time and if you aren't in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again. At this point, if you're not buying, either get off the ship or hold till death do us part.  Best of luck retards, I know we can do this

A poem for those who are bold
Rudyard Kipling wrote this in 1895, and it hits incredibly  close to home during these times. I hope it inspires you, not to just "diamond hand", but to have perspective of your current situation and how it is but a chapter in your story. All we can do, is to decide what to do with the time that is given us.   "If you can keep your head when all about you,   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;   If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,   But make allowance for their doubting too:   If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,   Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,   Or being hated don't give way to hating,   And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;  If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;   If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim,   If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster,   And treat those two impostors just the same:.   If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken,  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,   Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,   And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;  If you can make one heap of all your winnings,   And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,   And lose, and start again at your beginnings,   And never breathe a word about your loss:   If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew,   To serve your turn long after they are gone,   And so hold on when there is nothing in you,   Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,   If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,   If all men count with you, but none too much:   If you can fill the unforgiving minute,   With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,   Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,   And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!"  300 shares of GME checking in üôèüèº

RH eases restrictions again in AMC and GME
Why corsair (CRSR) has HUGE potential both short\long term !!
repost because of stupid auto mod.  i know alot of people really miss and need some new DD like old times, so here we go.    Corsair gaming inc.   \- one of the most popular in the industry of gaming and computer building\\parts. they sell everything.( keyboards, mice, headsets, controllers, capture cards, studio accessories, RAM, fans, cases,chairs, prebuilt PC...) the list keep going and actually covering everything in the gaming\\ streaming \\ computer industry.           basically they make money from selling to you retards all the extras for your sony \\ Xbox \\ PC, if you want to have cut edge equipment you buy corsair.  market cap -    P\\E - 58  next e\\r - 9th, Feb  shares outstanding -    price :  $  IV : +100%                 corsair has just announched about closing on public offering by selling insiders shares( of their highest owners -EagleTree which reduced ownership from 78% to 68%)  8,625,000 shares 35$ per share with 30-day option to buy another   shares.  in addition to that some of the executives of the company sold sold shares at 35$ which can be expected because it is the first time they cashed since the IPO.       RISKS:      there's a risk associated with corsair bussiness which is they depend on third-party computer hardware, particularly graphic cards and CPUs, and video games. - if any of the above will see a decline  it may hard crsr business. - every year there's new GPUs, CPUs and video games, and corsair will be there to provide their equiment ! i dont see this bussiness declining soon, quite the ooposite - when people will get back to work they will have new money to spend on their PCs and game consoles, and dont forget about new stimulues.   if eSports wont continue growing at the current rate and according to the excepted growth - there will be harm to sales.     POSITIVE:    gaming and creator becoming pupolar and keep rising at the   due to covid)   part of corsair products are used for "3 letters forbidden word"   and Power supplies)   alot of rgb product that attracts young audience.   variaty of products to all costumers (20$-1000$+)   still and young company with a very promising future ahead !   covid lockdowns made alot of people more aware to computers and gaming   Alot of influencers marketing corsair.  i think that corsair is perfectly positioned to continue growing, at the current rate they are a value play at a steal price. streamers and youtubers marketing corsair products and as a result corsair can expect to keep their growth in sales. they can generate billions each year in the up coming years and i really think they are under valued right now.  combine that with the crazy time we live in, shortage all over the world for GPUs, CPUs and gaming consoles - the demand is crazy and corsair will benefit as well.  at 21, jan corsair just filed   because of their latest "offering".  why do we care about that ? thanks to some guys from r\\investing i found that that apparently their next earning are already out and nobody talking about that.    For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:      ‚Ä¢ Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million      ‚Ä¢ Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million      ‚Ä¢ Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million    Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates‚Ä¶  In fact, the company initially estimated the following ( from Q3 release     For the full year 2020, we currently expect:  ‚Ä¢ Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.  ‚Ä¢ Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million.  ‚Ä¢ Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  Then, they updated the  guidance on November 30th 2020  ( :  For the full year 2020, we currently expect:    Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.   Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.   Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.    So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!      2)   But that‚Äôs not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again‚Ä¶ we just need to look).  As they mention on the Q3 report, ‚Äúas of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $  million, $  million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $  million‚Äù.  In the more recent prospectus (page 10):   In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $  million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.     This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.   As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So   this implies around 150M FCF in 2020   (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M).  (check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here    And about their operation statement which looks pretty promising, this is how a growth stock looks, i see a bright future for them.     if you with to look on their filings by yourself:             Crayons time !        30-35$ good support level, below that is a problem.  flag pattern been breached upward ! hoping to see 40$ holding strong and coming close to 50$ before er ! i believe the er run didnt even happen yet.     TLDR: Corsair is a straight up strong tech company which holds greater value than the market see right now, earnings on feb\\9 will be fire and beyond the earning i see a huge growth for this company. possibility of reachin 60$ after er is HIGH. play by your own risk.  Disclosure:  i own 200 shares at the moment and about   in 50$ calls, might add another 15k next week.  this is not a financial advice. do your own DD im only a  degenerate on wsb.
Reasons for buying and selling
Hi all there been alot of discussion about buying certain stonks on the dip when restrictions are lifted and counter arguements on how to unretard and cut losses and sell at the low (Dave Portnoy anyone)  Again only use cash, practice risk management and importantly mind your ego. Money is a social construct and its the material embodiment of your time.   Im personally holding because im investing my time to push the message of injustice on why big boys can fuk over retail with no consequences. Im not selling because im not folding my arguments and know its an investment to make the message worldwide. Yeah sure some will call me emotional and stupid for not taking money off the table or cutting losses. Guess what money is used exactly to make you feel better (nice food, stuff, sex, lottery) and this makes me feel better.  Again this is within my personal risk limits, my 8 shares rep 2 weeks salary, i can always do overtime to cover it.
Even though there was some good news that was released today regarding their Phase 1 data, I woke up to getting royally fucked. To the moon

#WSB ETF  Let‚Äôs leverage the collective wisdom of WSB and launch our very own r/Wallstreetbets ETF. We can easily raise the seed capital we need to launch and some of our ambassadors like Chamath would match the initial fundraise. If we could get Cathy Wood on our board to help manage it with Mark Cuban u/mcuban and others alike. Of course, u/deepfuckingvalue could help with analysis and technicals. With weekly asset reallocation based on WSB sentiment and the per below:   #Fund Allocation as follows:  WSB Sentiment: 30%  YOLOs: 10%  DD: 20%  u/Deepfuckingvalue: 40%  This could could turn in to the most successful and powerful ETF Wall Street has ever seen. Furthermore, we could issue 15% of the initial share offering to Autism awareness charities. This isn‚Äôt as crazy as it sounds and could be easily executed.   #Also, HOLD   üèª   (DISCLAIMER: Not investment advise, I‚Äôm just a simple gorillas who likes the stock and stumbled upon WSB and options trading and loves his fellow WSB family.

Why $SQ will crush Earnings (Earnings Play 02/23)
Preamble:   $SQ is currently trading at \~$228. They report their earnings on 02/23 and they're going to crush it! I personally think it's pretty cheap and it'll definitely have a run up. $SQ has two Lines of Businesses: Seller and CashApp. The Seller segment includes Square's managed payment services, software solutions, hardware, and financial services offered to sellers. The Seller segment generated $  million in gross profit in Q3 2020, up   compared to last fiscal quarter. The other line of business is CashApp which is like Venmo meets Robinhood. They offer retail trading for stocks like $AMC, $NOK, B\ T\ C, etc. and they charge a variable cost for each transaction. Hence, high-priced asset purchase = higher fee. High volume purchases = more $. And then of course, you have your cash wallet.  Here are my bull points:    Seller Segment:      Between November 5 (last ER) - February 23 (upcoming ER) there was Christmas, Boxing Day, Cyber Monday, New Year's and Thanksgiving. These are are all holidays that Small Businesses highly benefit off of      Retail sales will be up and same store sales will be up. Hence, more $ for $SQ.      Considering their Q3 revenues were up vs. last fiscal (when COVID didn't exist) and last quarter, Q4 revenue will be tremendous.   More small businesses are open compared to last quarter. Vaccine started being distributed late 2020 -> more people shopping outside -> more small businesses profiting -> more $   Most states (including businesses) are open ( .   2nd round of PPP: Credit lenders approved $5 billion loans in 1 week starting 2nd week of January 2021( . Small businesses aren't going anywhere and are here to stay.    CashApp Segment:       1. There was a very strong correlation between B\ T\ C and $SQ, but the derailment happened near the end of December. While B\ T\ C discovered new ATHs, $SQ remained stagnant.   Not priced in!   2. According to survey results, 40% of retail traders who switched brokerages when the $GME, $AMC, etc. trading restrictions came about, they had migrated to CashApp. From this survey data gathered, Mizuho gives a PT of $300 ( .   Not priced in!   3. $PYPL earnings came out and claimed that C-currency had a big influence. Meanwhile, more C-currency is being traded via CashApp.   Not priced in!   4. B\ T\ C trading volume nearly doubled vs. last quarter, and yet $SQ has only risen by 15%.   Not priced in!       Other Bullish Points:      1% of $SQ's asset is in B\ T\ C. B\ T\ C nearly 3x'd in the past 3 months. Meaning their B\ T\ C asset value 3x'd vs. last quarter.   Probably priced in.     CashApp 7th most downloaded in app store:       Bearish Points:      The gremlin look alike that is Jack Dorsey is currently selling   $ARKK is lowering the weighting of $SQ and $PYPL    Assumptions:      EMT   B\ T\ C doesn't crash before earnings  Take advantage of the low pricing right now to get in and using ER as hedge if you're planning to sell before expiry.
The one time I violate my trading principles and buy a stock b/c I believe in the movement and what we‚Äôre standing for. Holding forever. I‚Äôm already wiped out anyway. Someone has to be the bag holder I guess.

Merger Arbitrage between Aphria and Tilray. Free Tendies? What's the catch? Cannabis DD ($APHA and $TLRY)
Cannabis 2021 and Merger Arbitrage ($APHA and $TLRY Merger Arb)[ ]  So if you've been seeing the headlines of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer addressing marijuana, you're probably considering getting some exposure to the marijuana industry. Not a bad idea. I think it is a great opportunity, and it's where most of my investments will be in 2021.  But let me tell you about an interesting opportunity within the cannabis sector. $APHA (Aphria) and $TLRY (Tilray) are set to merge by end of April or May, and together will form the largest cannabis company in the world. $APHA is purchasing $TLRY, but the new company will move forward under the $TLRY ticker. So what does this mean?   Well, currently, the price of $APHA is $  and the price of $TLRY is $  The exchange rate for the merger of $APHA to $TLRY is .83. For every 1 banana from $APHA, you get .83 $TLRY bananas.   Lets say I buy 1 share of $APHA today at $  and the merger is tomorrow. My 1 share of $APHA will convert into .83 shares of $TLRY. At $TLRY current price of $ , your .83 of a share is now worth $  Remember, you only paid $ , and now it is worth $  just based on the details of the merger alone.   This also works with options, which makes me  rock hard.  Your contract of 100 shares at a certain SP, will represent 83 shares instead after the merger   but keep the strike price.   You can  literally  buy deep ITM call options at a steep discount. A $25 $APHA call is OTM, but ITM for $TLRY. However, just so you're aware, in this case your max delta of your option is 83 instead of   meaning instead of getting a $100 to $1 move, you will get $83 to $1 move.   I know what you're thinking. "Well that's why it's discounted dumbass." And you'd be wrong. Let's take a look at a couple call options and their prices..    APHA calls only go up to $25 right now, even 2 years out. So I'll be using $25sp    $TLRY $25c Jan 2023. That option is $1,218 to purchase, or $    $APHA 25c Jan 2023. That option is $610 to purchase or $    You're losing 17% in share control of your option, but buying at a 50% discount.   Anyway, not financial advice. Just babbling. Could all be made up while I wait for my crayons to heat up. Plus prices can change, but beyond your average red day there's no reason to expect a hard nose dive from either company at the moment, and instead looks like it should be a good year for cannabis overall. Maybe the best year ever, especially as an American, but we will have to wait and see.   $APHA $TLRY  üå± üå± üå± üå±

Now I know y‚Äôall are gonna downvote bomb me or be really upset about this shit, but it‚Äôs the fucking truth.   We need to understand this and realise what our options are now.   This place become a giant echo chamber of rockets and diamonds and ‚Äú10k Is NoT A MeMe‚Äù bullshit. It was definitely a fucking meme and a lot of people got sucked into that absolute bullshit.  The big money bailed on us, they were happy to leave us bag holding if we were stupid enough to do it. (Spoiler alert: we were) there are no such thing as ladder attacks, everyone looks fucking stupid when they say this, the OG members of WSB are laughing at us all in a hidden thread.   There is no squeeze coming. There is no more big money buying in. The squeeze narrative is gone, we can hold until we‚Äôre old and dead and out autistic grandchildren have our stocks, it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore.   You need to realise if you‚Äôre still holding now, you‚Äôre now a long term investor. Congratu-fucking-lations.   This is now a value play. Long term.  The reason I personally got in was because I believed this from the get go, before I knew about a fucking ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù.  I realised Ryan Cohen and his team are going to turn GameStop around and it‚Äôs going to be beautiful. Imagine getting on Netflix before it was Netflix, while they were still shipping DVDs? This is where we are with GameStop right now.   The price will increase again, it will be valuable but it won‚Äôt happen for a long time. And it probably might not ever go to $400+ again. (Sorry bag holders at $400+)   You‚Äôre a long term investor now if you‚Äôre still in. You‚Äôre options are this.   1. sell for a loss now. 2. Hold and be patient, have faith in RC and the process. 3. Keep being a delusional idiot and getting laughed at.   That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the options.   My position is 150 shares of GME at an average of $70. I‚Äôm bag holding with you idiots.   TLDR: Welcome to the #BagHoldersClub, would you like a drink you autistic fucking morons? Or perhaps a fresh serving of crayons?
To anyone worrying, and I mean REALLY worrying about AMC or GME, heres some motivation.
Think to a place in the future in where months or a year from now, you'll look to these days where you didn't cash out. You made thousands, tens or millions because you had the nuts to hold when the cards were massively stacked against us. I won't lie, the cards have now stacked two decks. But we always have hope. Mark Cuban, DFV- The 20s Scarface (The world is his) , and the 8-10 million plus around the world who are with us retarded investors battling the system day and night. Think if you cashed in, you'd of given in to a system that keeps fucking you over day in, day out. You'll watch as everyone on here will make the paper bag, the biggest most of us will ever see.   Its okay to be scared. I've been scared of a collapse for days, but that fear turns into strength. Fear, is what they want you to feel. But like apes, or the 300 Spartans, we are stronger together as one. They underestimate our power to virtually hold them hostage for what they've done. We hold the majority of shares, and were not going to stop holding and buying. They will run out of money soon, possibly again if were lucky. All we have to do IS KEEP HOLDING. They've rigged the markets for too long, the SEC sadly aren't on our side. Its time to show then where the bomb sights should be. Send them mass emails with evidence of corruption from the Hedgefunds. Keeo calling your attorney and show them the evidence. Do what you can to bring a fair game to the markets again.   If the SEC sees this I am no way calling for market manipulation or cheating. I want a fair system for all, so we can all make the money and have all the bannaenaes in the world. SEC Investigators, look at the real targets. Melvin Capital , Robinhood , EToro , Citadel, and those in the White House. If we gain enough attention in the right direction the SEC will prosecute those who hide in the shadows.   What keeps me going? A final thought. The picture of those in 2008 were waving and laughing at the protestors on Wall Street who were never brought to justice. Its about time we show the world that corruption comes from those above, not below. Godspeed apes, and God Bless. KEEP HOLDING, and if you can, KEEP Buying.
GME Investors Must Work Overtime
It's 8:14 PM. It's past my bedtime, but tonight, I have a cause. I join the daily discussion thread and inhale deeply: it's worktime.  I innocently parse the new comments, upvoting highly original "  " and "wife's bfs" jokes. I reply saying "if he's in, i'm in," laughing at my own clever joke. It's only been 4 days, but I already feel that I am a fellow WSB redditor.  Suddenly, my heart stops almost as if someone had insulted AOC or Mark Cuban. I reread the comment, "GME Bagholders WYA?".  My heart sinks.  Finally, redditors were fighting corruption and taking a stand against financial injustice, yet in my own safe space, our own haven, someone dared intrude and belittle our movement.    Our portfolios are red physically, but green morally.    I debate simply ignoring the comment or downvoting it, but I soon realize neither would suffice such a traitorous act.  I write him a detailed explanation of the "MOASS", including short laddering, short bussing, and the   Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack   .  Now, for the final touches.  I quickly send death threats to his inbox and reported him, feeling satisfied.  You do NOT mess with Reddit because we will NOT lose.    Reddit, ASSEMBLE!
YOLOd most of my Robinhood savings. Still holding.

Hope this explains the GME situation a bit.
I am an ape, not a financial advisor. While i was eating my wifes boyfriends   I stumbled upon this nice read from r/investing. I didnt write this. simply passing on what I saw and before you apes hate just take some time to read and hopefully lift your spirits back up from the battle.   GME Options data shows Shorts think you'll disband by March  Just wanted everyone to take a look at this write up DD below.   Hope it helps bring some clarity. Tried to post it in thread but it has images so can't        edit: TLDR:

When is the squeeze happening again?
As if your wine aunt needed CNN/MSNBC to give her another reason to think you're hurting retirees pensions, they can now promote buying GME as a white power dog whistle.
Holing the line with 100 shares. Recouped $2000 selling covered calls.
Some come here to sit and think, and write upon the walls ‚Äî well I come here to shit and fart and post my lousy calls  üëä
Ridiculous. FAKE NEWS HEDGE WING MEDIA saying that EVIL HEDGE FUNDS made money off of our glorious crusade against them. They think we are idiots. We all know that we bankrupted CROOKED MELVIN and all his hedge funds. They think they can trick us into selling. WE LIKE THE STOCK
i know its old data but are they just hedging?
Putting forward an alternative view for $GME.
Firstly, I hope this doesn‚Äôt get downvoted to oblivion. This is a genuine discussion I want to have to further help GME holder‚Äôs understand the situation and provide clarity.  This is in no shape or form financial advice, but my opinions on the stock and what has happened. I am holding 296 shares avg $37.  Have we stopped to consider that the squeeze has already happened? That initial jump from 100s to 480 last week may have been most of the shorts covering. Shorts needed to cover approx 70 million shares. If you look at the volume day to day from last week, 70 million shares could have easily been covered, as these days have very  high  volume. This is even truer when you factor in brokerage restrictions. If retail couldn‚Äôt buy, where was all of this crazy volume from? Most likely, it was the 70 million shares being covered.  If it is revealed that the short interest is still 50% or higher, this may very well be because HF‚Äôs took new short positions in the 400s 300s 200s. They are rolling in the green if this is the case. They probably bought options to also hedge against any potential issues. If this is the case, the short interest will appear the same on our end, but in order for a successful squeeze to take place organically, the price will potentially have to hit $500 organically for the new shorts to feel any pressure.  In terms of percentage as well, the jump from early double digits to 480 for GME was a bigger percentage increase than VW‚Äôs jump from 200s to 1000s. This solidifies further that the squeeze has happened, and the squeeze we saw was bigger than VW‚Äôs in terms of percentage.  I know a lot of people here got in 200+. So it would be great if we could get some solid discussion going on challenging what I‚Äôve said. For the most part, it seems the squeeze has happened and any new short interest has a firm grasp.
F earnings
F earnings tomorrow AH. My take- which is not financial or investment advice  1- Wallstreet is expecting a miss, which is good. They surprised eps big last time  2- They‚Äôve been releasing nothing but fluff articles about forward rev and eps.  3- Just released teaser for raptor update(I expect an f series overhaul that‚Äôll run into next gen. I know it‚Äôs only been a year but I expect and brand new f150 2022 as a preamble to the f150 ev line up. They‚Äôve done 1-2 year gen ups in the past.)  4- guidance should be solid regardless of eps and rev. With new models coming out(bronco, emach, f150). We are in ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù at this point and f has already pushed multi-year high.  5- multi-billion dollar deal with... google.  6- said deal is for Android based os(expect googl to move as well)  7- dividend resumption?! This is speculation but with the positive outlook and possible beat on rev(or speculation on future rev like preorders) dividends could(not plausible imo) resume. Dividends come back so do the boomers.  2/5 12C x20    1/2023- 3C x 1 Gonna add some  ‚Äôs at open

Canoo (GOEV)
Ok here is my first shot at a DD. I've been eyeing this company Canoo (GOEV) for a little while. I'm long 1200 shares @ a cost of $      Canoo is a new EV start-up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service. From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years. That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc.  Link:¬†   Now, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.  What I like most about this company is their "skateboard" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.  Link:¬†      It is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform. Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.        Having said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long-term hold for me.  Canoo (GOEV) currently trades at $ , hitting its all-time high at $  in December. So, it hasn't had a crazy break-out yet but I'm confident there will be one closer to launch.

DD on the GREEK SYMBOLS and OPTIONS EXPLAINED and AN ANALYSIS of a Call Option and an Example - The Final Paper
Using  THE GREEKS  to Analyze a Call Option Contract for Can't Stop, Won't Stop Corporation     Example:  \  --$160 Strike Price Call EXP Feb. 12, 2021   --  $160c 2/12    Current Price: Bid x $    Last x     x Ask    Current Greeks for contract (These are important for calculations)   Œî  Delta:    Œì Gamma:     Œ∏ Theta:     ŒΩ Vega:   Rho:       ## What is delta and how is it used?  Delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions. Delta is not a static number‚Äîit fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security, time to expiration, and volatility.  ## The standard definition of delta is:  Change in the option price √∑ change in the stock price  ## Why is delta important?  1.   Measuring expected change in option price.   Delta can be used to calculate how much an option‚Äôs premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a delta of   would be expected to rise in value by about $  if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1. 2.   Calculating the percentage of price risk.   Delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option. So, a call option with a delta of   has 70% of the price risk versus owning the stock outright. If an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk, they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas. 3.   Determining the probability that an option will expire in the money.   Finally, delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be in-the-money by at least $  or more. Therefore, a call with a delta of   only has a 5% chance at that moment in time that the stock‚Äôs price will be higher than the option‚Äôs strike price at expiration.  2/3/21   Delta: .3438      Every $10 up in stock price = +$     ## What is gamma and how is it used?  Gamma is another widely used metric for options trading. It is most often used by traders with large positions, but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave.  ## The standard definition of gamma is:  Change in the delta √∑ change in the stock price  ## Why is gamma important?  Gamma measures the rate at which an option‚Äôs delta changes as the underlying security moves. The gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $1 move in the underlying security. For example, a call option with a gamma of   and a delta of   would be expected to change to a   delta if the underlying stock or ETF rises by $1.     2/3/21   Delta: 0.3438Gamma    (Delta+Gamma = .3493)      Every $10 up in the stock price = +$        ## What is theta and how is it used?  Theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an option‚Äôs price  ## The standard definition of theta is:  Change in the option price √∑ one day change in time  Theta represents how much an option‚Äôs premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same. For example, a call option valued at $3 with a theta of $  is expected to be worth about $  tomorrow.  Theta can change as the options get closer to expiration. For example, options with a significant time premium ( , those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price) tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches. Another thing to keep in mind: Theta is exponential, not linear. That means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration.  ## Why is theta important?  Time decay is an important concept in options trading. Theta is the metric that quantifies it, so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes. However, remember that theta (like all the Greeks) is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time. On any given day, supply and demand in the market will determine whether an option‚Äôs price rises or falls.     2/3/21   Theta:   Decay  minus $  per day      Current price: $  - per day x minus $  = $  price tomorrow if nothing changes.    ## What is vega and how is it used?  Vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract. Volatility can have a major impact on your options trade, so vega can be important for assessing the risk-reward profile of a given strategy.  ## The standard definition of vega is:  Change in the option price √∑ percentage-point change in implied volatility  Specifically, vega represents the expected change in an option‚Äôs price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility. For example, if implied volatility rises from 23% to 24%, a call option with a vega of   would be expected to rise in value by $   ## Why is vega important?  Vega plays a critical role in determining the risk-reward potential of a potential option trade. If traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued, they may look at vega to decide which options and/or options strategies have the most profit potential.  2/3/21   Vega: .0534      For Every 1% change in Implied Volatility (IV) = +$.0534 per   50% up would mean $.0534 x 50 points = +$       Today was   IV - THAT'S CRAZY VOLATILITY.      The 52-week high for IV was 400.      There's a chance this breaks 400 tomorrow.

Rho measures an option contract‚Äôs sensitivity to interest rate changes, and is expressed as the expected change in an option‚Äôs value given a one percentage point change in interest rates.  ## The standard definition of rho is:  Change in the option price √∑ percentage-point change in interest rates  How is rho used? For example, a call option with a rho of   would be expected to rise in value by $  if interest rates rise from 2% to 3%. Rho can be positive or negative, but has the strongest impact on longer-term options and is often considered less important than the other Greeks by traders who focus on shorter-term options.  ## Why is rho important?  In a low-interest rate environment, rho has a less measurable impact on option prices compared to delta, vega, gamma, and theta. Still, it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longer-term options positions.     2/3/21   Rho: .0052 = +$  per 1% change in interest rate of borrowing   if borrowed shares interest rate goes from 19% to 29% = 10 points x .0052 = +$  extra to the option price       # The Summary:    For every $10 move up in the share price tomorrow; the options price will increase   (based on Case TWO)      Case ONE:    \[IV is +1% and Interest Rate Increases by 1% and Common Share Price increases by $10\] = +$   Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho = total basic greeks      $   -  $  + ($.0534 for every 1% move in IV) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase) = +$  (total basic greeks) / Current option premium price $  =           Case TWO:    \[IV is +30% and Interest Rate increases from 19% to 29% and Common Share Price increases by $10\]  Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho      $   -  $  + ($.0534 x 30% move in IV= $  + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase = $.052) = $  + Current option premium price    \                                      --    SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE, The Analyzed Option Premium Price Increased $  or   from Last price on 2/3/21 of $     \                                      --        TL;DR:   SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE,The Analyzed option (Can't Stop Won't Stop Corporation 2/21 160c) Increases $  or   based upon Case TWO with 30% IV increase and 10% Interest Rate increase.         If there is continuous BUYing and HODLing of shares and buying 2/5 call options  and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers, the options price will continue to rise   every $10 increase in share price based upon Case 2 and can be even more as IV goes higher or Interest Rate borrowing % goes higher.       What would happen to the 2/5 Calls if the stock price rises every $10. Exponential Growth Possibly and the Final Squoze. The Share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion. If 2/5 and 2/12 options are bought up and share price increases dramatically, the price will continue to go up infinitely until the shorts cover or are margin called.           I am not a financial advisor, blah blah blah, I like the stock and call option, so I analyzed a particular call option and gave different scenarios.

Still, it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longer-term options positions.     2/3/21   Rho: .0052 = +$  per 1% change in interest rate of borrowing   if borrowed shares interest rate goes from 19% to 29% = 10 points x .0052 = +$  extra to the option price       # The Summary:    For every $10 move up in the share price tomorrow; the options price will increase   (based on Case TWO)      Case ONE:    \[IV is +1% and Interest Rate Increases by 1% and Common Share Price increases by $10\] = +$   Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho = total basic greeks      $   -  $  + ($.0534 for every 1% move in IV) + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase) = +$  (total basic greeks) / Current option premium price $  =           Case TWO:    \[IV is +30% and Interest Rate increases from 19% to 29% and Common Share Price increases by $10\]  Gamma - Theta + Vega + Rho      $   -  $  + ($.0534 x 30% move in IV= $  + ($.0052 for every 1% loan interest increase = $.052) = $  + Current option premium price    \                                      --    SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE, The Analyzed Option Premium Price Increased $  or   from Last price on 2/3/21 of $     \                                      --        TL;DR:   SO PER EVERY $10 Move in SHARE PRICE,The Analyzed option (Gamestop Corporation 2/12 160c) Increases $  or   upon Case TWO with 30% IV increase and 10% Interest Rate increase.         If there is continuous BUYing and HODLing of shares and buying 2/5 call options  and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers, the options price will continue to rise   every $10 increase in share price based upon Case 2 and can be even more as IV goes higher or Interest Rate borrowing % goes higher.       What would happen to the 2/5 Calls if the stock price rises every $10. Exponential Growth Possibly and the Final Squoze. The Share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion even causing a halt on the way up.     Obligatory YOLO Positions:           I am not a financial advisor, blah blah blah, I like the stock and call option, so I analyzed a particular call option that I hold and gave different scenarios.     Edit 1: Please, no more awards, Might as well use the money for other purposes like buying more bananas or even fractional bananas.
They are trying so hard guys....
Mods a proposal: get rid of gifs on the Daily or AH threads
We are no better than Stocktwits now.    It was already getting close to unreadable with all the smooth-brained emoji posts bragging about their 2 shares of AMC.    But gifs are literally are making us a clown show.  Pretty much anyone with insight or having meaningful information or DD regarding options or the market are migrating to other forums because of this shit.    NIP THIS IN THE BUD.  WSB IS DYING BEFORE OUR EYES, BEING DROWNED BY MILLIONS OF LITERAL RETARDS
So wrapping my head around the SEC investigation...
Just looking for some clarification.  A bunch of people on an open forum decide they like a stock.  The stock happens to be massively shorted by a hedge fund.  Then, brokerages begin to limit retail purchases of said stock.  Then, per major news outlets report this hedge fund covers it's short position, while there are limitations for retail investers by brokerages.  All while this hedge fund has openly invested interest in a specific brokerage favorited by this open forum.  Causing massive 'weird' moves in the stock.  And the retail investors who make up less than 3% of the ENTIRE market are being investigated?  Dope. Dope.  I guess it makes sense since hedge funds pay their taxes so I guess they pay your salaries...... Ohhhhh wait.
Closed my final GME position today after selling most of my shares last week
SPCE is going to the moon. Good news on flights and it is takeoff
AMC, GME,BB, NOK ... what is next? What to expect?  üèª     real picture, no BS
Okay I hope this doesn‚Äôt get deleted... so much junk lately that even some good stuff gets deleted...   1. I‚Äôm not a bot  2. Fuck you SEC go after the trading app that prevents buying instead of waving the white flag and asking for an HALT to give time to raise cash... anyway  3. GME was in a unique spot... small float, over 100% shorts... squeeze was in a unique spot...  4. Now all the media and tweets and post are about oh this done... they gonna bag hold... movement is dead... THE SHORT dropped their position so it‚Äôs over...  Let me make this clear... you don‚Äôt need a 150% shorts to be able to squeeze em... it‚Äôs just way fucking easier and faster..:  A lot of new hedge shorted entering the game late when they saw the buying beeing blocked and made easy money...   Even if the shorts are at 50% ... you can short squeeze em THE SAME WAY... by continually buying and holding you help make the price higher... even by buying 1 share... it has an impact because let me be clear... we are 8M... remove 1M bot, 1M media, 1M data miner for hedge fund... we still...??? 8-1-1-1= maybe 5MüòÖdegenerates...  So heck if the 5M of us buy 1 share.... it make something.... and we know some of us got much more buying power... (for the SEC fuck you this is not Manipulation, no financial advise it‚Äôs just a fucking obvious observation)   That beeing said if we   üèª even if the short is 50% that 50% will hold like us and pay rising interest on their short until they say FUCK THOses retards we‚Äôre out and THEY BUY BACK THE SHARES... poping the price ‚¨ÜÔ∏è üÜô...  it‚Äôs not gonna have the same impact as a GME situation at 150%... BUT STILL...   TL DR... if you want to win don‚Äôt be like Davey and  ü§ö... just hold and be patient and PLEASE ONLY GAMBLE MONEY YOU CAN LOOSE...   Positions 3 GME share to be part of this at 110$  I believe more into AMC as a whole the squeeze and the AMC story... so 300 shares around 10$ and calls for march!   That‚Äôs it be safe guys and remember we can remain retarded longer than they can remain solvent  I fucking said that first and get quoted every where! I deserve my flair!!
AMC GAINS     EVERYONE HAVE A FANTASTIC DAY

I Love This Community, and I Think There's Something Really Important To Be Said
HOPEFULLY THIS DD WILL CONVINCE YOU TO CONTINUE HOLDING    I joined around September of this year, and this community has brought me more joy than pretty much anything in my life. I've made some really good trades and some very bad ones, but one thing is certain, I have acquired invaluable knowledge in my time reading DD and from making mistakes. Now here is some information I would like to impart on all of you.    DON'T LISTEN TO BEARS OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME    Remember, we are betting against bears, and we have a thesis contrary to them. This isn't a platform where everybody shares ideas and grows together. Yes there are people willing to help, but at a certain level, there will come a point where you make your own trades based on your own DD. If you did the proper research, you should trust your gut. Many people will shit on you, especially when it looks like you're going to lose, but that's just the way life goes. The road to heaven is paved through miles of clouded hell.    DID ANYTHING CHANGE TO MAKE YOUR POSITION SEEM INCORRECT? NO? STOP FUCKING PANICKING!    This is just like the time in The Big Short when Michael Scott and Co. are screaming at Ryan Gosling for upping premiums on their short position. Nobody knows what the fuck is going on at the highest level. This level of criminality is parallel to what happened from 2001-2008. I'm so confident in my position that I'm not even considering selling. Everything is so fucking complex right now, and when things are unclear or murky, there is likely fraud going on.    BANKING DEREGULATION HAS GONE ON SINCE THE FUCKING REAGAN ADMINISTRATION    Imagine that. We now live in a world where shitheads like us were banging rocks together at one point and now make millions of dollars to bang boulders together. Wall Street didn't get smarter, they just managed to get the feds to stop looking.  \[ROCKET EMOJI\]  Please guys, I beg of you, do not sell your position (unless you went full retard and bet your rent). At this point, we have nothing to lose, and they have everything to lose. Remember, Monke hold banana if banana no poison Monke. Silverback who try to poison banana cannot poison banana that Monke not give to Gorilla.  Trust in Mark Cuban. Trust your fellow bulls. Hear the arguments of bears and do research to refute it. A strong argument needs to hold water against a counterargument. Good luck everyone, I'll see you on the fucking moon.  Edit: Why can't I see any of the fucking comments. ALSO I SAID DO RESEARCH NOT LOOK INTO THE ECHO CHAMBER. BEARS DO HAVE POINTS THAT NEED TO BE DISPROVEN  Not financial advice. I‚Äôm retarded and using leveraged student loans.
Hey SEC, we saw the news headlines: want some advice on how to find market manipulators?
Search the term.... "Which is it" inside of the WSB subreddit... You will have allll the proof you need.  (link below for those who don't know how to search ffs)     you guys should post other terms that would help shine a light on how retarded this situation really is....  and spoiler, none of it is gives benefit for retail investors AT ALL.
Congratulations r/wallstreetbets - we now have the ability to use GIFs, custom emojis, post HD videos, and earn a hero badge!
It‚Äôs already in the will to never sell- my great great grandchildren will thank me.

Personal Risk Tolerance
Hello degenerates,  Some of you may have read my last posts regarding investing in BB long term as well as other stocks that dipped during GME‚Äôs rise. Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.  I probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can‚Äôt focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.  Many, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don‚Äôt trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.  This is how a stop loss works in simple terms:  1. monkey buys share for $100 each. 2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, the monkey selects ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop on Quote‚Äù and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell 3. Confirm order  Congrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.  ‚ÄúOh, but why would I buy high sell low?‚Äù Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.  It is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúIM NOT FUCKING SELLING.‚Äù That‚Äôs great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.  First, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today‚Äôs price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).  ‚ÄúBut Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!‚Äù yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not? Well then, I hope this information helps.  (this is not financial advice)  TL;DR ‚Äì Stop Loss good. Max Loss Bad.     EDIT: Your comments reveal how little a lot of you know about trading. Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn't going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of "only invest what you are willing to lose" is completely misapplied here.   If you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000. How about you invest $5000 and set a stop loss at $4000. Same loss, but much higher potential gains.
6k loss üß†            hopefully if you did this right you're sitting on cash you can play with and ready to show the true value of amc and gme.       ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë buying more tomorrow.
Idk man, I feel like a Falcon 9 booster...
My $GME stake isn't as impressive as some of you glorious retards, but I still wear my losses with pride... and I'm NOT FUCKING SELLING!!
The view from the top was okay - 50k to 350k and now at 93k. Not flinching, lets go.
Losses and Bagholding on Robinhood: A Retrospective
Strange memories on this nervous night on Robinhood. Two weeks later? Three? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era‚Äîthe kind of peak that never comes again. Wall Street Bets in the middle of January was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of loss porn or memes or    or   can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and YOLOing in that corner of your wife's boyfriend's basement. Whatever it meant. . . .  Tendies are hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of ‚Äútendies‚Äù it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of all the autists and retards comes to a head in a long fine short squeeze, for memes that nobody really understands at the time‚Äîand which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.  My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty threads‚Äîor very early mornings shitposts‚Äîwhen I checked WSB half-crazy and, instead of cashing out, aimed the big $1650 Robinhood account towards GameStop at $325 per share, wearing cummed-stained shorts and a ramen-stained shirt. . .chucking rent money into AMC at $16 per share, not quite sure what my exit strategy was (always stalling at the sell button, too autistic to take profits while I fumbled for more YOLO money) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I traded I would come to a place where people were just as retarded and    ed as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .  There was madness in any stonk, at any hour. If not across GME, then in AMC or BB or NOK. . . . You could strike tendies anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .  And that, I think, was the handle‚Äîthat sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Boomers and Hedge Funds. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn‚Äôt need that. Our autism would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting‚Äîon our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of GameStop, a high and beautiful wave. . . .  So now, less than a week later, you can go up a steep chart on Robinhood and scroll back, and with the right kind of autism you can almost see the high-water price‚Äîthat place at $500 per share where the wave finally broke and rolled back.
I fear they are going to tank the market and blame WSB squeezing GME
Obligatory not financial advice. I know nothing and am    that has not made up for losses since March last year.  Imagine you are uber-egotistical douche who stands to lose a lot on a "should-die-cause-I-say-so" company due to internet retards after illegally short selling more shares than there are. But that's ok, you practically own the MM Castle HQ and can do whatever you want. How to get out of this mess? Buy back the shares at a loss? LOLOLOL nah.  Step 0 - Just don't deliver the shares. Got friends in the right places so just do what you want. Oh the internet retards are saying there will be a squeeze and twitter just exploded. Time to be more active. Guess I'll go after a bigger fish.  Step 1 - Sell tons of massively high IV options on gaming company to build some quick free capital. Then sell some megacaps (especially those tech stocks that just had an absurd year). Make sure to do it quickly to really bring the price down. Funding secured.  Step 2 - Force price of gaming company down. Stop retail from trading and use some good ole fashioned short laddering to clear out the stop losses and paper hands. At same time, sow FUD using news buddies. Wait a second, why don't I have my big bank buddy from a few years back dangle something shiny in front of everyone (AND have tell everyone the internet retards love it) to divide and conquer?  Step 3 - Buy tons of the artificially dropped calls for cheap. A ton that expire the same week, and some more out over next few months. Same week is good because as MM I have fail to deliver rules of T+6 instead of T+3 so timing is the Friday after options expire.  Step 4- Bring the general market back up and hold it steady at close to, but slightly lower than, the prior high. This will drop volatility enough to buy a bunch of general market puts and volatility calls while still signaling to TA nerds that we could head back down with this double/triple top.  Step 5- Run the gaming company price back up. Internet retards will think its start of squeeze and pile on. Price will skyrocket again and at same time dump tons of those mega caps. Make it look like having to dump big names to buy back shitty company shares.  Step 6- Once it hits the right level, exercise the lowest cost calls to grab enough shares to at least cover delivery needs for cheap. Sell higher cost calls for even more absurd IVs. Longer dated calls should help with next few rounds of delivery; should buy enough time for this to fade. It will look like squeeze took place so even most of those internet retards will be out.  Step 7- Dump the megacaps again. TA nerds and HFT bots will keep it going. Profit off all the fear generated in the general market about impact of squeeze - always a bigger fish. Sell all those megacap puts for profit before buying back megacap shares until back up to level from step 1 at a discount. Or teach them all a lesson, by switching over into cash and safe assets and letting the market fall. Will get the news buddies on blaming those internet retards...  TLDR; GME
The game plan for tomorrow
GME Loss Porn. Still holding 40 @ 307
Congrats $GOEV holders. All else, another opportunity missed because good DD is impossible to share here now.
Is there any statistical bull case for GME at the moment?
I know most posts that threaten the morale of GME usually get downvoted to hell, but I'm genuinely curious (because I own 10 shares @ 298 at the moment).  Most of the DD being posted relies on a wild theoretical being true: if GME is still X% shorted, if synthetic shares were sold, if shorts have already been covered, etc..  I'm all for flipping this thing on its head and taking off to where it was speculated to go, but too many of supposed DD is just full of wishful thinking.  Edit: And I don't say this to downplay hopes of GME going   lot of people including myself I'm sure just would like to know - realistically - where we go from here.
Slow down in the go down
Are they gaslighting us right now?
Total Noob. bought most of my stonks today. i can hold for at least 2 months. longer if my wife's boyfriend helps with bills.

Am I doing it right?
Thinking of selling ? ... please help with the limit order   don‚Äôt want to sell too low and miss out on monies .
My palms are sweaty
I'm an investor in SPCE and the sheer amount of idiot shills that have flooded our subs are actually a decent argument that somebody in the hedge fund world is still running scared.
FWIW I've been subbed here for years but not really active since I don't fw options. Anyway...  The two Virgin Galactic subs have been absolutely inundated with asinine bullshit over the last week or whatever and it's obviously connected to GME. It very well may just be a bunch of toddlers all in their feelings trying to chase the next "squeeze" but either way in the blink of an eye we've gone from optimistic price targets of $170-$200 to "fuck yeah boys we're going to $700" for NO FUCKING REASON.  Even with   million of you retards I still find it hard to believe that the level of stupidity we're seeing over there is just natural spillover from the enthusiasm over here. It's straight up easier for me to believe that somebody is paying a bunch of remote workers in whateverthefuckistan to shitpost about SPCE all day. RIP our mods.  That's it. That's my entire DD. I thought about jumping into GME <$100 but then was like nah. Now I'm looking at how ridiculous and forced the activity around SPCE is and genuinely wondering if there isn't more than meets the eye.
$GME gains for the past month.
We're really only sticking it to one fund. The rest probably made bank when they sold off shares to the rest of us at $300+. It's over. Just sell and get out while you can.

Have faith in each others, this is not over yet
For once I will not joke around on this subreddit. It's time we took a deep breath and get serious for a minute or two..     The hype is gone boys, we had our peak popularity a few days back and since then it has dropped, some people have sold and it all rides on us now, the core of this subreddit. Do not forget that we made this happen without the help of others, and we will succeed just as well without them. This subreddit, while big, was not this big a month or two ago. This has all been exponential growth. While hedge funds and Robinhood has screwed us over in many ways, let us not screw ourselves in the meantime. They have successfully made the most of these "paper hands" scared and they have sold... But if we remain strong, if we remain here with good faith with our fellow brothers. Then we can still stand and fight another day.  We do not need hype to hold, we do not need media to encourage us to hold. We know what has to be done, and I am damn proud of you all for how far we have come. But I am not saying this so we can feel sorry for ourselves. We are still in this fight and you better not disappoint the people who had massive gains yet did not sell. do not disappoint the massive amount of people who have bought a single yet crucial share. We are into this together and we will leave together.     Besides all this, again, I know this is hard. Some have tens of thousands of dollars into this, most of us are deep in the red. But once again, but without the meme, Hold. Holding is all we can do and we have to be strong.      Here is a picture displaying some information, while unconfirmed, this does show some info like the amount of short still and something about "Days to cover  " Can someone find out if this is  ?     I hope I will all see you at the finish line, together, with arms across each other with some green in our portfolio..
I see someone's wife's boyfriend is already trying to smoke on the moon.

The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack - why GME‚Äôs real price is $2,147,483,737
Hey diamond hands,  as I am sure you have heard, there are rumors that short ladder attacks are being used to suppress the price of GME. While I held this belief for many days, I am now beginning to realize that even more insidious and backhanded techniques are being used against us. I mean seriously, there is simply no reasonable explanation for why a stock should drop in price. None.  The good news is that Melvin is more scared than ever. The bad news is that today was no short ladder attack. No, it was far worse.  Today we experienced a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack  Most people here have at least a few days of investing experience under their belts, so I'm not going to dumb down these concepts for you. If you can understand a short ladder attack, you can understand this tactic as well.  Basically, a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack (or Overflow attack for short) is the opposite of a short ladder attack. In a short ladder attack, shares are traded back and forth, with each trade a penny lower. In an overflow attack, the attack chooses to instead trade shares to an accomplice at incredibly high prices. How high you ask?  $2,147,483,648  That's right, hedge funds have been selling single shares for billions of dollars right behind our backs. Why this price though? It's simple.  Every investment app, RH, TD, etc, use 32 bit integers to store prices. The maximum value of a 32 bit integer is 2,147,483,647. So what happens when it goes up by one? It goes negative.  This means that every share in an overflow attack is worth:  -$2,147,483,647  What do you think this does to the price of a stock? If you answered bad things, you are correct. The sale of one of these shares is enough to send the price of a stock far into the negatives. Didn't think that stocks could go negative? I'm not surprised - that's another hedge fund secret. They don't tell you THAT on investopedia!  But as the critical thinkers you are, I'm sure you will now ask:  "Why isn't the stock price negative right now?"  The answer is because the squeeze is happening RIGHT NOW. Paper hands laughed at the idea of an infinity squeeze, but it happened and it was big. So big in fact that it overflowed the price itself.  MATH TIME  So we know that GME overflowed in the squeeze. But by how much? Well we know that the price right now is $90. But we have to take the overflow squeeze into consideration.  If there is -$2,147,483,557 of pressure on prices, then to reach $90 the stock must cost 2,147,483,647 + 90, or $2,147,483,737. Yes.  EACH SHARE OF GME IS CURRENTLY WORTH $2,147,483,737  We can't forget about overflow however, so the price stored in your brokerage account is actually -$1,073,741,734. Now this might sounds like a scary number, but as long as you didn't buy on margin you will be fine. As long as you keep holding, the SEC will be FORCED to do something about it. They are already under extreme pressure to help retail investors - it's only a matter of time.  And as a side note: If for some reason Melvin stops this overflow attack, your stocks will be worth over a billion negative dollars. At this point, buying GME makes a profit whereas selling puts the next 10 generations of you family into debt enslavement. So as the wise investors on WSB say: BUY!  WE DESERVE OUR BILLIONS  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬† Edit: please stop messaging me, look at the flair on the post man ¬†  ¬†  This is not financial advice I swear to God please don't let the SEC take me away. Positions: 0 GME

New Horizons - $GME of the Future
Imagine an army of retards utilizing their entire savings to buy and hold gme shares post squeeze indefinitely. As volatility dies, share price stays around 90 stably. Months pass. What was once considered heavily inflated is now the actual value GameStop. In time Ryan Cohen makes tremendous strides to improve GameStop‚Äôs outlook and profits. 10 years pass. GameStop is now trading around 6900 a share and institutional money is heavily entrenched as they see the long term prospects of a fantastic company. In hushed voices in dark rooms wsbtards who collectively own majority stake of GameStop orchestrate a coup of epic proportions, massive sell orders of entire stakes are activated at once tanking the stock price to pennies per share and Wall Street and value investors are stunned to silence.  r/Wallstreetbets posts ensue, weeks of gain porn posts and c  bottle popping. January 28, 2032 ‚Äú$GME YOLO update‚Äù DFV posts of photo of loss porn of andromeda like proportions. The Holiest of Holders held and shame spreads quickly though-out his kingdom WSB. ‚ÄúWe have failed you supreme leader‚Äù echoes throughout the subreddit.

AMRS Gains Update Pt. 4  üí∞
Regshi FINRA update Feb 3rd
$GME  Volume short: 9638240  Tot Volume: 17735739  54% shorts  If we assume the same ration for real total volume (higher than the one reported to FINRA) That's around   M shares short today  If we assume that any other transaction was a cover then: New shorts (not covered) =   M  The data since 27/01 is more than 50% every day. Meaning more shorts overall.   It's still possible Melvin is out (at least partially) It's still possible that they are covering old shorts with new one (like cover a short at 30$ keeping open one at 90$, or averaging up), new shorts are supposed to be more expensive in term of interests though  Very basic DD, consider the assumptions though.  TL;DR  Short positions are likely to be increasing since the 27/01 according to FINRA daily data.     üåí

$ATVI Earnings are tomorrow after the bell
I see a ton of bullish sentiment in both sell side analysts, this sub, and most ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù (ewwww) subs.  I‚Äôm not that convinced. EV/Sales 45% higher than EA and TTWO.   WoW Classic didn‚Äôt quite have the meteoric rise I thought it would. But I‚Äôve heard great things about Shadowlands, but I think the MMO genre is fading a bit. But the money is so good.  And does Call of Duty really have that bright a future versus other FPS? Fortnite has Gen Z, CS:GO the purists, and Apex seems like it‚Äôs the closest thing to a Halo title.   So let‚Äôs talk about what ATVI really is then, a mobile game company.  That‚Äôs where the money is, that‚Äôs how they support this valuation. The risk to consumer preferences is so high. Unless you all tell me you all play ATVI titles.   Mike Morhaime started Dreamhaven, poaching Blizzard OGs, and really just about their whole hiring pool I would imagine.  Is the tide turning? I think so, but I could be wrong. Because mobile gaming is basically like a casino and it goes brrrrrr to shareholders.  Position: FD ATVI puts strike $85-$95, $1,000 in value

DD on $TSM, a play on the auto industry Semiconductor Shortage.
I work at a hyundai dealer, our corporate a month ish ago sent us links to articles about the coming semiconductor shortage in the auto industry. The shortage is forcing many manufacturers to hault or slow productions. This was technically good news for us as hyundai dealer as hyundai manufacturers their own and wont be effected.   The shortage has affected Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers.   But why should we autists care about this shortage, Ticker $TSM.   Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, ticker $TSM has only dipped their toes into supplying for the auto industry. 3% of sales were related to the auto industry in 2020. They are being pushed by these manufacturers to change routes to help supply for this shortage.   From the article, "In 2020, auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC's sales, lagging smartphones' 48% and 33% for high performance chips. In the fourth quarter, sales for TSMC's auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter, but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales in the quarter." "Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is   its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic." "The ministry told Reuters that it had received requests from both the United States and the European Union through "diplomatic channels" late last year, as well as from Germany and Japan this year."  Long story short $TSM        ü§ö    Positions, 10 shares at avg 127 2 3/19 $130 c's  Bullish article on $TSM for the shortage       Articles on the shortage

You enjoy watching xQc / Shroud / Ninja / TheStockGuy? You think live streaming has a bright future? Read this DD about $HUYA
Long time twitch viewer, long time investor, 1 year old WSB member lurker. I'm a millenial and have been in the stock market for about 5 years. POGCHAMP.  Twitch is the north american leader of live streaming and I would love to invest in it. Here is the problem: Amazon owns twitch, therefore if you want to invest in twitch, you need to pay for amazon shares. Twitch is a drop in the ocean.  The only equivalent companies I have found are $HUYA and $DOYU which are both live streaming leaders in china.       BOOMERS have actually shorted $HUYA stock for 35% of the floating shares.   I guarantee you that the shorting boomers don't have the slightest fucking clue how the business model of live streaming platforms work. They don't understand the strong sense of community that twitch builds upon and why people would donate money willingly to their favorite streamers. I have seen the twitch viewers grow from the past years and I don't see it stopping anytime soon considering millenials are growing older and so is Gen Z.     I know that nobody cares about fundamentals these days but just look at those numbers:  HUYA sales in 2016 (In Millions of CNY):    HUYA sales in 2019 (In Millions of CNY): 8,      The growth of live streaming platforms is absolutely insane and I believe it is the future instead of regular   The market cap of $HUYA is only   Billion$ which makes it even more attractive for WSB buyers if they decide to like the stock. Considering the huge spike of interest in the stock market by the younger generation, and the fact that AOC had 300k concurrent viewers on twitch when she was talking about the $GME saga. It shows the bright future of this industry all over the world.     Also, the gaming giant Tencent ($TCEHY) owns shares of $HUYA so this literally can't go tits up.     THE RISKS OF THIS INVESTMENT     IMO, the real risk of this investment would be the content restrictions that can be imposed at anytime by the chinese government.  It doesn't concern me too much because even though they can decide to ban video games at any time, people still feel a strong sense of community with a particular streamer.   At some point people do not even care for what video games their favorite streamer decides to play. A good example would be the streamer xQc on the twitch platform.   My man can play overwatch/valorant and even chess. He will retain an average of 70k+ viewers every single time.     DISCLAIMER:     Not a financial advisor (aka retarded). I'm pretty fucking biased considering I have 25k on the line in call options but hey, I put money on my thesis.
Ethical/Legal Update
I posted this earlier, sorry to repeat half of this. Update at the bottom             I'm not a licensed broker, lawyer, doctor, clergy, anybody to rely on. Now...  I'm seeing a bunch of shit like "if they can ladder down, can we ladder up?"     #    No. We can not.      That's market manipulation.   It's not even a good idea;   if you mean to play a short squeeze, every sale you make is a chance to let a short cover - and other reasons that's a flawed idea - but that's not my point.   Yeah. We're all making our own decisions here, It's not wrong to discuss why we made them.     What we're not permitted to do is manipulate prices.   Some of the hedgies are used to doing it because they're not documenting themselves in the public eye like WSB is.   We have to play it straight here.    .  #Update:       There have been institutional players liquidating positions, too. I just read a (somewhat condescending) WSJ piece featuring a couple of long-side firms who were using the spike to take profits on a $700M position they opened in September.   Not everything that looks like manipulation truly    is    manipulation.  Dropping single lots at a time would be the thing to do if you wanted to avoid crushing prices all at once with your huge wad of shares.  Before we get all "it's lies! MEDIA LIEES!  REEEEEEE!"  - I'd be surprised if they're the only ones. I'd been trading around GME for months by the time this happened, it'd be shocking if more players weren't in it.

GME - Short Staffed, Out Spending Their Tendies
Do Not Transfer From Robinhood
I mean obviously do it as soon as everything has settled, cuz fuck Robinhood but right now they seem to be rejecting almost all transfer requests. Once the request hits them it will be rejected and they‚Äôll deactivate your account, locking up your assets and cash. You won‚Äôt be able to buy, sell, exercise your options. Literally nothing.  There‚Äôs no phone number to call, your best bet is emailing their hotline and hoping for the best. People on social media have reported it being OVER 2 WEEKS and still haven‚Äôt had their accounts reactivated. And with all the legal shit they‚Äôre about to be going through, don‚Äôt think for a second allowing customers back into their accounts will be one of their priorities.   Imagine opening your account Friday and seeing GME shooting up rapidly. $300, then $500, then $1000. The squeeze is finally happening. But you can‚Äôt do anything. You can‚Äôt sell, you can‚Äôt exercise those calls. All you can do is sit there and watch your precious tendies get throw into the dumpster behind your local Wendys. Do Not Transfer!!!
Ford: It's a data company now?
TLDR: Was in Ford for that EV money coming in from the government, but the Google Deal opens up another revenue stream.   Positions: 230 $15c Jan 2022     First of all, fuck the suits and GME                  I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.     It's a value stock  . Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.   If you want to talk fundamentals, it's something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass and putting it into small bags for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.   If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.     Gubmit money  . This is nothing new (  situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others.     So what if it can become a tech company?   Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone for Ford example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the  . Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.   So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($      Risks, disclaimers etc etc:   Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat.

GameStop is done. From a bullish view.
All the people forcing the   ü§ö bullshit should really check themselves. When we first started out with $GME we wanted it to hit the $  mark. Keep in mind $GME was literally $20 in December.   That‚Äôs such a surge in price. I don‚Äôt believe in this movement anymore. The people who want you to   ü§ö are letting you just lose and lose money. They don‚Äôt care about you or the movement, they just want to damage the hedge funds and have a collective movement.   You all should‚Äôve been cashing out around ~$300 you would‚Äôve made good money either way. This is more than dead. We should‚Äôve known. The people with money have the power. You think the corrupt government official taking speaking fees or whatever is going to help your low life cause? Fucking no. Get over your fucking self.   This is just gonna get the tiny amount of outcry and then become crumbs swept under your wife‚Äôs boyfriends fridge.   We‚Äôve lost if you haven‚Äôt   ü§ö yet. There is no winning anymore. There was too much interference from many outside sources. They have the money to do so. If these billionaires really wanted to stick it to the hedge funds they would‚Äôve purchased so many shares that literally cost them squat to purchase. They‚Äôre fucking billionaires.   TLDR: Wsb has lost. We as the community has lost. And I‚Äôm not a bot if you‚Äôre wondering suck my dick. This whole ordeal is a bunch of delusional bag holders getting fucked. I was bearish as fuck on this. I took a moment to take a breather and it doesn‚Äôt matter, this price is not spiking up ever again. Sure it may be a good long term hold, but is it really?

Palantir Poised for Swiss Move as Europe Hub
Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW) - Stock poised for breakout, and is relatively unknown, but certainty worth your time looking into with multiple catalysts for earnings this month.
Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that.   The company is Atlas Air (AAWW).  This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up.   Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $  billion.  They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.           The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.¬† In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.  The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of   This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of   Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of  , also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.  They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet.   A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.¬† If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.  AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up   year over year and revenue up   The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of   and a Price to Book ratio of    The company‚Äôs cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $  Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.    There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.    The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.  Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without  Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.  Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.  Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.  Sixth catalyst if you go into long term   time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.    Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.     To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.  Literally Can't go tits up.  Positions  \-55 3/15 Calls  \  5/21 Calls  Sources and more information about the company and industry:

Should I buy GME right now while it's low? I YOLO'd and bought high
I bought GME when it was over $300 and I'm holding. But now it's very low and I'm not sure if I should buy another share. Should I just YOLO and buy?
Quit the speculation, what are some facts about the GME situation.
I'm embarrassed that I jumped onto this which I admit is my fault. I'm still holding and I wish I sold when I was up. There is tons of misinformation here and I would like to know what is actually true. The brokerages are back open and yet the price is still falling. Go on explain that with the same bullshit like when there were "ladder attacks".   How many shorted shares are there still outstanding?   When will we find out for sure?  If you wish you would have sold @ 400 then you can't say you actually think there will be a short squeeze, and now you are just hoping for one.
About pessimism.
Pessimists are usually just midwits, constantly in fear of being exposed for what they are. They hide behind walls of irony and pessimism, in hopes that their bad predictions will come true and they will be morally validated. They want to feel like they are part of the club of the smart people who predicted everything, the paper hands who sold early or never bought in, to begin with.  There is nothing validating about predicting failure, none, it only serves to demoralize your own side and in an effort to prove itself right. It is an excuse to not have to do anything because "the fight is already lost" while you feel super smart and try to pull down people who are not cowards, in fear that they might actually succeed.  Maybe we'll succeed, maybe we'll all be rich by the end of this or maybe we won't. That is a possibility. But trying to demoralize people around you does not make you smart, it makes you a coward.     TLDR:
GME ruined this community...
Seriously everytime I browse this subreddit all I see are the same generic posts about holding the line on gme and gme loss porn. At some point, we as a community have to move past this ‚Äúfrenzy‚Äù and go back to how we were. I joined this sub to read good thorough DD and make money, not look at some fifteen year old posting his loss porn on gme because he bought at 400. I don‚Äôt care if I get banned or downvoted, this sub needs to go back to how it was.  Edit: Here come all of the gme lover boys downvoting

My strategy is to keep buying more to bring my AVG. OPEN down to around   with the hope to cover my losses or even take off to andromeda. Is there still hope that $GME can reach 200+ again or am i just investing to lose more money? Also is this strategy of mine worth a shot?   Processing img qldh264c5hf61...
Checkmate - The Next Step For GME
Lot's of new people in this sub and the posts are getting repetitive and way off track. I want to share something meant to help redirect our focus in general.  During this insane rally, the media has tried to script a narrative regarding what we're all doing here and why we're buying GME, and that narrative is far from reality.     are playing right into their hands with all of these 'us against them' and 'I'm not selling, I don't care if I lose my money' style posts. It's actually KILLING us, believe it or not.  Why?  Because that is exactly what the hedge funds want the public to believe - this is simply a bunch of idiots trying to pump a dead stock in the hopes of taking down the shorts.   That narrative is perfect for the HFs because the masses sitting on the sidelines wondering if they should jump in are  , idk. Taking on hedge funds sounds like fun, but these guys always win, the stock just plummeted, I'm not getting involved in that, but I'll root for 'em!  And the fact is, that is NOT what's going on here at all.   We need to stop with the incessant us vs them posts. That's not what we need at all. Is there an us vs them aspect? 100%. Are we trying to change the way the system works and pull back the curtain for the public? Without a doubt.  But the most powerful thing we can do, what will ensure success not only for those currently invested, but for those who join us in helping to bring GME back from the dead is:  WE NEED TO SHARE OUR REASONS FOR LOVING THE COMPANY - OVER AND OVER, CONSTANTLY!!!  I didn't get into this play because of a short squeeze. That's icing on the cake. I got into this play because a savant CEO just took his world class e-commerce infrastructure and turned a 100k company into a $40B company in a few years. And he's coming to GME to do it again.  I got into this play because GME now has Ryan Cohen and his crew, along with Amazon's tech engineer as well as Josh Krueger, who handled fulfillment for Amazon, Walmart, and QVC. Those companies have performed okay, right?  It isn't very often that you have a company with this kind of brand recognition and nostalgia for us 18-50 year olds being reinvented by a team of proven leaders who have shown that they can get the job done better than most.   destroyed Amazon in their niche, and that's saying something.  What happens to the stock price when RC comes out and starts to share his vision? What happens when they name him CEO? What happens when the direction of the company starts to become clearer and the numbers begin to back up the potential?                                                                   This is an AMAZING value stock. I LOVE IT!!!  If it's worth $800+ in a few years, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.  That all being said, if we constantly post reasons for loving the company,   others will see the value of the company itself and will want to support it's growth  . That's the heart of investing - putting your money behind a company you believe in and want to support because you want to see it grow.  This short squeeze, fast cash, fuck the shorts and stick it to the man narrative   HAS TO CHANGE  . It's not helping anymore and in fact, it's hurting the company severely.  Yes, we want to expose lying, cheating and manipulation. And it wouldn't hurt to see rich, greedy, assholes devoid of empathy get smacked around a bit at the hand of the little guy. Who wouldn't want to see that?  But that's not why I'm supporting GME and I know it's not why most are either. We need to remember that. And if we want to see this company grow and the price of stock rise, we should let the world know why we believe so strongly in it. That's not collusion. It's not organized trading. It's coming together to support a company you love and letting the world know why.  You know what will stop that kind of momentum -   ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING.    And once the rest of the world sees what we see -  # CHECKMATE  Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. This is common sense. Make your own choices. Position - 3610 shares at $143
Where's the Discord?
What happened to the WSB discord? I can't find it pinned anymore which means Im not getting my daily dose of GME Copium!
ENOUGH WITH THE OTHER STOCKS!!!!
Everyone needs to chill the fuck out about trying to make quick overnight games. Idk if anyone else saw, but the wall street journal just released an article titled "Calmer trading eases nerves on Wall street" FUCK THAT. If we keep looking for other stocks to send to the moon, we are going to let stocks like gme crash and burn. So for the love of God please stop fucking pushing stupid stocks trying to create a quick gain for   NOT GOING TO WORK. Now please, everyone with any stocks, liquidate and move to GME, let's not make this just another failed movement.
'Holding the Bag'   Still growth ahead!
Alot of us bought in >300, similar >200 and >100. If you have held, continue doing so, If you have the cash, continue to hedge down (cash being money that wont impact your required living expenses). This is more of a long play to get it back. If they continue exiting shorts which they will over the next few days, we just need to hold our shares and buy the dips... Some of us did get caught holding the bag but the sentiment should be the same - I bought this for the cause, not to hopefully make money and i know a lot of you did too.      That BAG WILL BE FULL AGAIN, HOLD + BUY!!!!!!!
A bullish case for NOK
Have you ever tried to break a Nokia phone?  It‚Äôs impossible.   Where are we trying to go?  The moon!  What‚Äôs the most likely driver of Nokia to the moon? Large thrusters  SPCE appears to be up, so does TSLA, and AMZN - all companies invested with space exploration with large thrusters  Positions:  $NOK $10 calls - any expiry  NOK also beat earnings today, which improves their chance at securing funding for these large thrusters.
GME & AMC
DAMNNNNNNN GME AND AMC IS ON SALE AGAIN   üèª is time to load up for me  (This is not a financial advice) I love the stock
The Best COVID Stock You Haven't Heard About - Some DFV Level DD
Sup Autists and Apes,  While everyone has been out there ripping call options on all the COVID Vaccine stocks, I believe I've found the real winner of COVID.     Let me introduce you to Molecular Partners AG ($MLLCF on the OTC Markets), I like this stock a lot.   # Who they are:  Swiss biotech company who created an antibody cocktail similar to Regeneron's COVID treatment.  # Why they are the next 10 bagger:  COVID won't been a global pandemic forever, but it's going to be around forever. Much like there are many seasonal flus, there will continue to be many seasonal COVID variants. This makes treatment more of a reoccurring source of revenue than a vaccine.   And MLLCF's COVID treatment is the only which is not dosed via IV (like Regeneron's).   Which makes it the only COVID treatment that you can get in 5 minutes at any doctor office.   It was also recently reported to be just as effective versus all variants of COVID that have/can emerge.  # Why I felt this was important enough to bold:  90% of COVID patients never go to the hospital, meaning all current treatments miss the vast majority of the addressable market, and MLLCF will be the only available treatment for millions of people worldwide.  # Why I'm posting this now:  After reporting promising data at a recent healthcare conference, they release earnings on Friday 2/5. And even better, their phase 1 data is due out any day now (Q1'21 forecasted release).  # Why I'm in the stock:  I was first introduced to the trade by hearing "Scientist, Virologist, Healthcare investor / Hedge fund Manager"  Michael Taylor (@biotequity on Twitter, he's been spot on with a lot of calls throughout all of COVID) discuss it back in July. Here's what's happened in the name between then and now:       Last summer, MLLCF did a secondary offering and their stock shot up 20%, the opposite reaction we see when companies usually issue more equity. The stock reacted this way as they only did the secondary offering after being approached by investors who wanted a bigger stake in the company, and afterwards, big players felt they hadn't bought enough, so bought much more.   REGN's clinical data can be interpreted very positively for MLLCF's likely future success, as the treatments are based on similar antibody cocktails.   NVS signed a partnership agreement with MLLCF back in October. NVS bought 45M of MLLCF stock, gave them 22M upfront, allowed them to keep a 22% royalty on future sales, and embedded a 165M option if trials are successful.      All in all, that's nearly a 250M deal for a company that had a 300M market cap earlier in 2020.      # Looking at valuation:  Comparable companies without data are trading at a 3B-5B market cap, implying more than 5x potential upside in MLLCF.    To quote Michael Taylor, "I don't understand how it's not a 5x"     This is not investing advice, just some info on a stock that I like a lot. Mark Cuban suggested we do some deep research, so here it is.       TL;DR:    MLLCF will have the only COVID treatment you don't need to be in the hospital for, and 90% of COVID patients don't go to the hospital.  Novartis signed a partnership deal with them back in October that was nearly worth the same as their entire market cap at the time.  Their treatment was recently announced to be effective against all variants of COVID, official phase 1 clinical data is coming any day, and they report earnings on Friday 2/5.  If the trials are successful, which looks promising due to similarities to REGN's and others, this stock looks like it could go from 25 to 100+ based on comparable company valuations.     You don't even need to buy options (nor can you), and the stock may have 5x-10x potential this year.       Check it out yourself:    You also can find lots of info on twitter by searching $MOLN (the swiss exchange ticker)  Position: 2,000 range worth of shares (partially redacted due to where I work)
Whatever happens with GME, I'll sleep soundly knowing I was part of something that brought down Andrew "lyingfuckface" Left and his "research" company.
This is the victory I don't see talked about enough on here.  Now listen you numb fucks, I don't mind short sellers. Hopefully you dense retards realise they are actually needed in the market. They can provide balance and stop everything turning into a pump&dump. But what I cannot stand is the type of Andrew "my wife left me and screwed me for $50k per month child support" shotseller (seriously, look it up, she went total fucking Yolo on him)  However, this prick was just a fraudster. It speaks volumes that Wall St put all it's faith in a man who was banned from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for fraud. He had the audcaity to even appeal the ruling (he lost lel).  That weasel cost me money on NIO when he spouted more lies about it and gave it a target price of $25 in November. It tanked about 12% in a week due to this prick.  HEY GUESS WHAT TURDBRAIN, IT'S UP TOP $57 NOW, ALMOST ITS HIGHEST EVER PRICE.  This rat even used his lies to try and destroy struggling companies in Africa for his own personal gain. Because ya know, if it's one thing the world needs more of, it's shitting on Africa for financial benefit of the West.  Thanks to GME, this prick shorted one short too far. He has lost all credibility (if he even had any) and Shitron won't be able to tank stock by spreading a few lies on twitter anymore.  This alone, my dear apes, is worth its weight in Playstations bought from Gamestop.
Some Original Posts please!
I‚Äôll invite you all to post some of your original positions below.   Where are your bets at? There‚Äôs more to this community than just targeting shorts! Emerging companies. Recovering companies ? I wanna hear about it.   I just bought 30 ‚ÄúTom Tom‚Äù shares at ‚Ç¨  They just announced disappointing results but I believe the drop in value is fickle & temporary.   Your turn ü•≥
I don‚Äôt even feel the loss because I haven‚Äôt sold. The price can drop all it wants, eventually they have to buy and they‚Äôll gladly take YOUR discount
Weak paper handed bitches would sell at a loss because they‚Äôre inexperienced. You hold, put it in your hand and squeeze. Apply that pressure and you will get your     This isn‚Äôt financial advice and I‚Äôm mildly to severely retarded
How much do people think AMC will go up, if GME goes up?
If GME goes up does that mean AMC will also go up because i feel like only one of them will go up, but also i wonder if AMC can get over 100 do u retards think so?   I mean if AMC goes up this whole subreddit is fucking rich
Keep carm
For the people that bought gme and amc, go make a cuppa and dry your sweaty hands, you've been holding this long you can hold longer, the rocket ship isn't build in a day.  Im not a financial advisor. Stay strong apes
CALL ME WHAT YOU WANT BUT THIS STARTED WITH ONE MAIN GOAL BEING TRANSFER WEALTH FROM RICH TO POOR NOT FROM ALL THE STUPID IN AMERICA TO THE RICH
all these random people that bought in because of the publicity and are holding because they dont understand wtf is going on. well i hope they can afford the loss
GME REAL TIME TRADES - RELENTLESS SOHRT LADDERING - Paper Hands Please FUCK OFF
Here's a resource for us all, real-time share movement.      Don't get me wrong, THERE ARE definitely pussy ass bitches with featherweight paper hands selling for a loss. They are TRULY retarded, and will miss the moon. But the VAST majority of movement is from hedge funds short laddering, the buy volume is still almost TRIPLE the sell volume. And we ALL KNOW the short % interest in ridiculously high. This war is just a matter of time. Truly.  Hedgies are doing EVERYTHING to keep this stock price low, to force out these paper handed bitches and to prevent further buying interest. There is simply nothing we can do other than WAIT IT OUT. During the VW short squeeze the stock price collapsed for 5 DAYS STRAIGHT.  Do you want to be one of those brain-damaged people who sold FOR A LOSS literal days before the potential eruption? This isn't investment advice but hoolllyyy fuucckk don't be stupid!     APES TOGETHER STRONG. WE HOLD UNTIL THE END
Stay strong all this isn‚Äôt over
Still no retail sell off in the last few days. Observe the low volumes we‚Äôve seen over the last several days. People are still holding. This morning on the drop there is only a volume of 5m compared to average of 100m. No retail sell means we are still in business     ü§öüåé üåå
The final $GME DD?
Hi guys  Member when $GME squeezed?  I do.  There was some gamma stuff in there, and some short covering, the price went up over 20x, it was  fucking crazy.    .  That was then, this is now, here's what we know:    Wall street is rigged   The buy pressure momentum got castrated mid climax    The shorts shorting at $10 probably got out at a loss, new shorts probably entered in the upper ranges and made bank   The cost to all short holders is significantly depressed at the current market price.  .   If there was a day of reckoning when shorts all had to buy-in at once it would certainly be ugly, the numbers don't lie, there are a lot of shares short out there that may be impossible to cover   The only way for a buy-in to happen is upward momentum caused by buy-pressure   Unless you guys have a bottomless money pit or major market participants enter that's probably not going to happen   No matter how much you shame each other and throw away your life savings there is no guarantee that the price spikes again   Don't turn this into a ponzi scheme  Can we talk about something else now?
Fucking HOLD
Look at the volume of $gme.
Why GameStop trading at $400 is fair
I commented this on a different post and thought I'd make it a post in and of itself.  I am basing this statement loosely on Chewy valuation which is around 43b (I know they are different companies but hear me out).   First of all. Brick and mortar is dead so the turn to e-commerce is a move away from sudden death and a great growing opportunity, and with the help of talented individuals (Cohen, Amazon dude and such) they can really do this right.  Both Chewy and GameStop have (had) Cohen on the board and are operating in a growing market catering to a specific kind of customer (with games/e-sports being just as big or perhaps even bigger than pets).   Remember, Amazon also sells pet products, however, Chewy found a niche and targets these customers directly with their own specific product. People like to be catered to by others that know what they're talking about, which is a growing trend.  Would you like bread from an official bakery using the best products or would you like prepackaged bread from the factory? The prepackaged food will do fine, but the bread from the bakery is just better. This same analogy can be applied to Amazon v GameStop. Chewy has proven this argument right.  This, together with the recognizable name, is why I see this trading at around $400 (in a few months/years) which would give it a valuation of around 30b.     for multiple years for me. This is not investment advice, I just truly like the stock.
To the people selling, honest question..
Why did you buy in to sell? This is the stock market. If you cant fight for it, and you are scared. This isnt the place for you. Why go in just to surrender like the french in ww2. You go in hyped and you get punched a few times and you stqrt crying?  Sure it looks fucking rough. But so did everything in this world. If we stick together, we pull through. Its those who decides to be selfish who destroys humanity.   Whats the difference between you and those HF managers. There is none. You already decided to screw the populace for your own reasons.  Not financial advice. Literally just curious why some of yall weak minded folks trying to play in the adult pool. Go back to the baby pool and play with yourself.
HOLD & AVG DOWN
I was up +100% on my 7 GME shares (it‚Äôs what I could afford, average cost 165) and now I‚Äôm down ~50%. I‚Äôm just going to go long now on GME, keep buying shares and average down. If Cohen is in the rains and can do to GME what he did to Chewy (43B Mkt Cap), then GME (15B Mkt Cap) still has a long way to go         HOLD & AVERAGE DOWN  This is not financial advise, I just like the stock.
LEXX just hit a bear trap but it‚Äôs on the rise. Options expire tomorrow guess they don‚Äôt want a squeeze.
Interesting developments in the market recently leave me to believe we are on the verge of a bull market. Retail investors and their influx of cash have made several shorted companies to see big profits in these past few weeks. Stay tuned, more developing..
Mindset
I have been a proud member of this sub for a mind numbingly   days, and I think I understand the intention.  This subs about YOLO with money and gambling it all because why not. May get rich, may lose it all. Stock market is always a gamble.  My point is, just like gambling, don't put more money into it than you can afford to lose.  And if you're putting money that you can afford to lose, why not hold?  You knew the risks of the market. If you sell, it's 100% chance that money disappears.  If you hold, there's always a chance that you get it all back and more.  No shame in pulling out for liquidated money now if you need, but tbh then you missed the whole point.  Edit: definitely not financial advice I'm pretty much autist
Against my girlfriend's advice (more like demand) and with the very good chance that the only intimacy I will be getting is from myself... I am seeing this through the end and holding.
I came in at the peak of GME a week ago.  I bought about 5 (RH limit then) @ $330ish and bought another 10 on my GF's fidelity account at around the same price.   At dinner last night, my GF and I had a talk about GME and she asked what my plans are.  I told her I am getting quite concerned.  But the fact that I have already lost money, it is pointless for me to be impatient and sell off.  I might as well hold on and be patient.  Every night for a week now I have prayed that things will turn around soon.   She told me that she thinks (  do what I am telling you now) that I should sell and count my losses.  I told her I disagreed.    I am standing my ground.  I am holding until the end.
NOK
After a solid Q4, beating EPS expectations +3 cents. And higher free cash flow. NOK seems like they‚Äôre finally getting the business moving.   5G, network build-outs, and custom software all make me believe NOK, should be going up.   Why isn‚Äôt it?
DD on BlockBuster Stock (BLIAQ)
BlockBuster (BLIAQ) Ticker ‚Äì BLIAQ  For those who do not know what BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) used be a nationally recognized chain that marketed itself as a video and game rental store. BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s used to be everywhere. A BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on one side of the town, another BlockBuster (BLIAQ) on the other side of the town. At their height of BlockBuster (BLIAQ), BlockBuster (BLIAQ) had an annual revenue of $  billion. That‚Äôs a lot of BlockBusters (BLIAQ)!  Many are unaware that BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is still around! Currently headquarters in Bend Oregon, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is able to stay profitable by selling BlockBuster (BLIAQ) T shirts, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) cups, BlockBuster (BLIAQ) videos, and much more BlockBuster (BLIAQ) merchandise.  I believe that millennials and even Generation Y are beginning to spend money on items that they once loved as a child. This means going into a BlockBuster (BLIAQ), renting 4-5 videos and games from BlockBuster (BLIAQ), and experience the BlockBuster (BLIAQ) smell all over again. It‚Äôs BlockBuster (BLIAQ) tastic!  At the moment BlockBuster's (BLIAQ) revenue tops at 1 million with only 50% in debt. They‚Äôre looking to expand their BlockBuster (BLIAQ) footprint within the United States by BlockBustering (BLIAQ) the BlockBuster (BLIAQ)s.  This BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is a long term hold. Theirs‚Äôs no saying when BlockBuster (BLIAQ) will BlockBuster (BLIAQ), but I believe BlockBuster (BLIAQ) is going to be the new BlockBuster (BLIAQ)!  I forgot rockets -     üí•                üåñ   Note ‚Äì I am not a financial advisor, I do not have a position in BlockBuster (BLIAQ) at the moment. I just like the stock. Also, fuck you Citadel.  For those that don't get it -
PLEASE STOP CREATING FALSE EXPECTATIONS (and hold, if you can afford to)
TL;DR: Don't create false expectations. Don't post biased and unfounded analysis. Remain silent and hold. Stay retarded.    The beauty of all of this (this subreddit in particular and this whole event in general) is the fact that now, more than ever, the regular folk is looking at the stock market and curious about how it functions, leading to a socialization and democratization of the fundamentals behind stock trading. This is gamechanging, and will definitely have a lasting impact that we have yet to behold.  But democratization does not mean instant comprehension. What I'm trying to say is, we can now  access  the knowledge. It doesn't mean we  have  the knowledge, nor that it will come easily or effortlessly.  Stock Market analysis is a very complex discipline. Even disregarding the fact that the system is absolutely rigged (both in paper and in practice) to favour the big fishes in detriment of the little investor, there are still a lot of concepts and dynamics to grasp before one is able to make an accurate analysis.  Michael Burry didn't foresee a crack in the system by comparing two graphs and reading a news article. He had studied the stock market for over a decade before being able to detect the housing market crisis. Even DFV did a fuckton of research before making his move, and is also a financial analyst as far as I know.  What am I getting at with this? That your biased, unidimensional and rushed analysis ("GUYS, I LOOKED AT ONE GRAPH OF THE VW 08 SQUEEZE AND IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE GME, TODAY IS THE DAY!") is not helping anyone but the hedge funds. Why? Because you create false expectations, which in turn affect morale and condition people to panic-sell when said expectations are inevitably not met.  The bottomline is, if you don't have anything productive and elaborated to say, you'd better remain silent (and holding), for everyone's benefit.  But I'm not a financial advisor, I barely can read and had to ask my dog to type this for me, so don't take my word on it.
Robinhood not processing transfers?
Initiated a bank transfer on Jan 29 and it still hasn‚Äôt reached my account on Feb 4. It hasn‚Äôt taken this long before. Was wondering if anyone else is experiencing transfer issues and if it possibly means that Robinhood is restricting buying by slowing transfers? Need to buy DIP!
Our hands may be in the toilet but they can't flush them like we're some paper intellectuals because ours are made of diamonds and clogging the drainage.
Hope the worth drops to 50$ a piece so that I can afford to buy one more and ride three of them to the moon.
Do not give in!!
We have been divided with several different stocks by the big hedge funds. They think they're winning!! Everyone, switch over and buy into the GME dip right now! Show them that is not over yet. We haven't even started. WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON!!!!
What price targets are we looking at for GME and AMC?
When it squeezes one more time it will be done and none of us will want to miss it. What prices are you guys looking to sell? Is anyone setting sell price limits?
Bye bye PaperBoy Portnoy
You came in acting like you‚Äôre the king of trading on RH. You joined the movement and brought along some decent (cringeworthy, yet decent) energy with the movement. You brought along a few million retards with you and for that, we thank you.   But you were never really about it we‚Äôre you? You were hoping for a pump and dump and a get richer quicker stock. The moment you saw a crash, you folded with the quickness and then blamed it on RH.  üòò  Now thanks to your paper handed bs, your few million followers have most likely lost a shit ton of money and are probably blaming YOU. You only lost cuz you sold bud.   Keep doing what you do best, which is eating shit pizza on the sidewalk while treating everyone around you like a peeon.  Barstools small business fund is an absolute joke btw. He‚Äôs raised what, 38m? And helped a measly 200 businesses? Something doesn‚Äôt add up there.   TDLR; Portnoy is the üìÑü§öüëß  cringe lord.   ü§ö  always win
Just some reassurance from a fellow retard
bought more AMC 5 minutes ago. . . . . . No financial advice in this post, but my autistic ass is ready for the moon     EDIT: Spelling. EDIT2: Spelling
YOU CAN BUY FRACTIONAL SHARES OF GME ON RH NOW
Title. For all the retards like me who cant afford full shares, robinhood is allowing fractional shares again
Very clear manipulation
I‚Äôm not a financial advisor but it‚Äôs clear what‚Äôs going on. If you observe the buy sell ratio which usually shows when there‚Äôs more buyers than sellers the price goes up. This morning it was the opposite. The hedge funds are doing everything they can to drive the price down so much that even when there are 3x buyers to sellers the price is going down. All that means is when they fall, there gonna get annihilated. Reply if you agree/disagree
$90 IS THE SUPPORT
GME will never be lower than $90  Do what that with you will  This is not financial advice. Obligatory something strange w crayons...
Holding because principal means more than money
I‚Äôm tired of the game being focused on those that have the funds to sink from other wealthy people and shitting on the little guy. This system has been broke for too long and this needs to negatively affect the hedgefunds or market in general.     üåï
Honest questions only
How is it that when the bell rings we got under 1M of volumein the first 15min and the price lowers >10%?  I just checked Tesla and there‚Äôs around 300k volume and the price has lowered <1%...  PLEASE HELP I‚Äôm new to this.  HOLDING 10 GME ~95$ 10 AMC $
Change My Mind
Hedges, brokers and media are going to try and turn this into a pump and dump story more than a "people getting back at wall street" before this is over.
a special episode on gme, Can Our Users Profit? (
Hear me out retards,  Of all the stuff that has been happening lately, there is one very crucial thing happening right now.  Some say the evils of wall street have closed their position.   That is absolutely not true.  As they are trying to take every tendie from you and burn our community to the ground by taking it over.  Gentleman, only together, united, can we win from them.  Every voice counts, make it count!
Is the meme lord in to buy GME?

Just a bit of motivation
Hey, so I am sure a lot of us are seeing a lot of read right now. I just want to say, either way we keep going down or going up, I am happy that we actually had an impact. A lot of people here say that its retarded to keep holding but what they dont know is that we are a bunch or retards. That in and of it selfe makes them retards for missing that fact. But in all seriousness, I wont sell my shares, im holding with the true diamonds. I rather lose it all than giving up to be honest.      We either lose a lot for now, but in the near future when Game Stop gets big, we get our reward. Or when (if) the squeeze comes. So either way, we good. But I just want all of you that are holding and reading all these negatvie comments etc, dont mind them. I got 7 shares, holding. No point in giving up this late and we are not quitters...      HOLD my brothers and sisters, and only buy if you can afford.
üßê
Market shot down with hardly any sell orders compared to buy orders. Seems fishyü§î  Sloppy, Melvin. Sloppy
Isn't it strange how that works
Yesterday, with the circuit breakers flipped on to stop short selling, we had a stable price.  Now that the circuit breaker flipped back off, we're back to starting the day with a massive dip.  It couldn't possibly be illegal market manipulation that the SEC should investigate, right?
Sperm Whale Theory
I posted this theory as a comment in the daily discussion thread yesterday because I was too new to make an actual post. Thought some folks might enjoy reading today. Have a good one boys!    Sperm Whale Theory    1. There's a mega wealthy dude out there (the Sperm Whale) sitting and lurking on the sidelines right now, just waiting for the exact moment to strike and make a move; he's gotten fcked by hedgies before and he wants retail investors to win this time. Plus he knows hedgies are cocky and think they have this in the bag because they are up against a bunch of cash poor apes. 2. He knows there's still going to be big sales/discounts on these volatile stocks in the days ahead while short positions increase as hedgies and well off "late to the game" retail investors open new short positions. 3. This thing keeps building momentum on the retail investor side, with little nuggets of inspiration coming out semi-regularly that motivate retail investors to keep holding and buying to the extent it's not ruining their lives (  management team announcements, RH and other trading apps loosening restrictions and not being shit heads, WSB community growing in popularity, govt. getting involved to increase transparency, etc.). 4. Legislation passes and US govt. decides to start sending more COVID stimulus to people. 5. The Sperm Whale, with his massive steel whale balls, opens a HUGE position, buying at an incredible discount of course, and ignites this mthr fckng rocket. 6. Retail investors, having just got their hands on $1400-$2000/each (collectively billions of straight cash from the govt.), go all in on the stocks they like. 7. The stocks they like go to the moon.  Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor and this is not advice. Come up with your own stupid, made for the movies, pipe dream theories.  My strategy: Hold and buy dips and go long.
GME short interest STILL ABOVE 100%
According to  , GME short interest IS STILL OVER 120%!  Nothing is over.
Unpopular Opinion: The squeeze has squoze
Everyone comparing today's squeezes to the VW squeeze in 2008 are missing one huge factor: in 2008 online brokerages werent as evolved and the number of retail traders wasn't as big as today.   The market moves faster today than it did 13 years ago. News moves faster through social media. If the squeeze took 3-5 days for VW why is it so hard to believe it would only take a fraction of that in today's rapid trading environment? I believe the squeeze was ready to peak last week but was deterred by restricted buying and now continues to be suppressed by media outlets.   The game has changed, dont get left behind with the bags.
THANK YOU FOR THE DIP! Added another 28 shares - not much but its honest work. If we all 8 million degenerates did that, we would own the whole of GME in no time and squeeeeeeze it. 68‚Ç¨ - roughly 80USD for my USApes.

A message to the SEC...
Lick my hairy balls.  Holding and buying more GME because I personally like the stock.  This is not financial advice. I am a retard and love eating crayons üñç for breakfast and dinner.
Paper hands Portnoy jumps back on AMC after losing 700K paper-handing GME
They removed my last post on this for refering to him as "porntoy"?  Seriously?  I was reiterating how he referred to HIMSELF as "porntoy" in his PR press release.  It's not an insult if you are simply rehashing his own words.
This needs to be called GMEBets
IT was fun everyone. This community has turned into a GME only echochamber that gets you banned or deleted for mentioning anything other than that. The odds of anyone even seeing this is basically 0 because it will be deleted. I am holding my AMC still, the GME squeeze already happened dont try explaining how it hasnt cause I wont listen.
Hold the line! Buy more! (If you a want)
Bought more and more over last two days.   Holding for next week and week after and if it doesn‚Äôt move - F it, I‚Äôll just hold till GME becomes an online gaming powerhouse in another year or two and keep holding. Don‚Äôt care!
Hindenburg Hit Job on Chamath Palihapitiya
Interesting timing coming a week after Chamath Palihapitiya went on CNBC and was very positive on retail investors like us.  The list of items in the hindenburg research looks like items that we already knew about and some of it happened several years ago.  It looks like another attempt at market manipulation by short sellers.
Just a Retard Asking a Retard Question
Wouldn‚Äôt providing the physical company gme liquidated revenue cause the stock price to go up? I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 17, but it makes sense that if we all started doing our part and mass buying products from the actual store the companies value would go up. What‚Äôre y‚Äôall‚Äôs input on this because I‚Äôm very retarted.  E: if an influencer with enough $$ and people behind him started up some kind of charity for the kids we could potentially do a lot for the company itself.  E: I have autism and Down syndrome
NOK : Why Not?
Explain to me.     I'm in.
toll   boys!!!!! Or
Think you retards messed up your decimals. You said yourselves that your math skills are bad, and it shows
Actual predictions and the current state
So from what I understand they are now no longer allowed to short ladder, correct?  The stock for this week has hovered between $85 and $115 ish   So what does that mean? Are they still driving the price down? Has it settled and the result is going to be a battle of attrition where eventually they have to buy at initially $95 resulting in a spike?  What is happening now? (Are they still using forms of attack to keep the stock down or has it settled for now) What happens next and when so we think it happens? (We get it diamond hands hold to the moon etc but when is that and what does it look like)
Why are we still doing this?
No offense, but as much $$ as we've all lost in the last week, should we really be taking advice from a million random social-media strangers with little-to-no investment experience?  Legitimate questions here: What's keeping everyone in? What's making ppl cut their losses?
For those of us still on RH, re: $GME
I received a notice this morning that $GME can be bought as a fractional share once again.
Imagine if every one of you paper handed pussies and diamond handed autists bought one share. Thats a $90-100 value potentially worth $500-$1000 or more.
million shares exist  Supposedly 140% were shorted which is   million shares  Ryan Cohen has 13% which is about 9 million shares. He can‚Äôt sell.  If the autists and retards are still holding an avg of 5 shares at 4 million people thats 20 million shares. Based on avgs. Retail investors own around 30% of   corporate shares total, so that 20 million number is reasonable.  Thats now 29 million shares.  If everyone buys 1 share we bump up the shares that are NOT FOR SALE to 37 million shares... This is more than half the total REAL shares of the company.  Lets say only 50% of the company is shorted.. they still need to buy   million shares.   This is all just based on the numbers that anyone can find easily in about 15 minutes. That all could be completely wrong cus i have  üß† Im too much of a retard to know how hedges can buy synthetic shares and use those to cover shorts if thats possible, or if they dont even need to buy our shares. No clue. And tbh our shares could be dog shit wrapped in cat shit in that case. But I believe that there is another squeeze on the horizon. We just got knuckle run to it apes.      disclaimer    my wifes bf took away my crayons and gave me a phone so I can make them more millions  Obligatory
Anyone who has been here awhile knows all the movement in $GME will happen Friday hours or minutes before closing
Obligatory this is not advice, I just love $GME.   Come on, we all know how this stuff works by now. They use whatever ungodly powers they have to suppress the stock until as many people as possible sell their weeklies (a joke, just so no one thinks this is literally how it works). Then, it surges out of nowhere just before Friday closing and only those few with the diamondest of hands profit many fold over.   See you at $1000 on Friday 12:30pm
YOU CAN BUY MORE $GME ON RH NOW!!!
I JUST BOUGH ANOTHER SHARE OVER 100 o have no idea what the limit is now tho.
You're in denial people
I'm no bot. I enjoyed the ride as well and it was fun. But people here need to wake up and realise that it's over. You're just burning your own money and in some cases it's really terrifying. The longer it takes you to accept your losses, the more painful it'll be.

Everyone holding GMC&AMC right now have got giant fucking nuts
It sucks being poor that 100$ or 8$ is a lot for some people but they still came out showed up and held it down. I‚Äôve been on Reddit for a while I‚Äôve watched this group but never joined because I‚Äôm fucking poor      but I‚Äôm here for this shit and I‚Äôll stay after.   This has been a movement so don‚Äôt stand still keep moving! I‚Äôll hold till the top or 0 and if you can‚Äôt do that then take your money and run.   But Imma lay down and die on this fucking hill.

ATTENTION BANDWAGON HANGERS-ON AND ECHO-CHAMBER SMOOTHIES
The overly optimistic head-in-sand rah rah hewld 4eva spam is so goddamn irritating, it makes me want to sell the shares that i was already planning on holding just to NOT be part of this group. When I enlisted I was joining the band of WSB low-IQ retards, not the r/all caravan of single-celled microbe house-plant marble brains.   WE FUCKING GET IT   - you opened a robinhood account, liquidated your pokemon collection and spent $378 on a game disc scratchoff - I'm holding shares but I swear to yahweh the more shitty low-effort posts I see in rising with the same copy/paste "SH0RT L4DD3RS R 4 REAL - EMOJI POWER MOON ROCKET" horsehit, it honestly just makes people think "hey I like coloring on my walls as much as the next guy, but am I THIS fucking dumb?" Enough with the attempts to reassure yourselves via CONSTANT spam - hold your goddamn shares and post QUALITY MEMES OR NOTHING AT ALL GOD DAMMIT
I HAVE AN IDEA
Hear me out. If everyone on this sub sells, prices will go down, right? Basic stock market right there. Now, when the prices go down, what if everyone buys back more shares for the discounted price, ultimately having more shares at the end of the day. Also, if hedgies see the stock go down, they'd also panic sell, because of course they bought shares. So, the liquidity of the stock would be higher, hence everyone here gets to own more shares for the same price as before. This would finally pump the price back up, where suits would buy in again, leaving us with more shares and them with less.  EDIT: Shit, I never got so many angry answers in so little time. Also, I wrote this while taking a dump, so fuck those that say I'm with the suits
For the people who holding and don't feel the need to spam the homepage with
90% of wsb is now normies spamming the homepage.  I will limit the amount of GME/AMC post to only the relevant information.  Feel free to post your DD's, discuss topics without having to scroll through endless garbage posts.
Regarding the HOLD, positive motivational words motivate positively! Post to your desired outcome!
Fellow autists, "Don't X!" and "it isn't Y yet" is posting to, and sharing your fears! The media loves quoting these. Don't let them!   Don't get me wrong, loss porn is still great too! If you sold, and you lost, the desire is to be honest, admit defeat, move on, and/or at least reap sweet sympathy karma is a positive thing!   But, if you're still holding, post your desired outcomes, encouragements, and spites ("ticker says I'm down, but I say hold long") and let the media quote those instead! They can't break what isn't broken. We hold long and we hold strong! Share the love! Share the unity!  This is not financial advice. This is not mental advice. I'm not a professional of any kind. I just have these
In 2022 Gamestop Announces....?
Where would you guys like to see this company go if it survives?  Personally, I would like to see an e sports retailer with its own line of hardware.  Think alienware for PCs, but maybe even partner with Steam and design a console.  A console with upgradeable hardware and different performance tiers.  The brick and mortar stores would then become much like Apple stores, selling their own brand.  Gamestop already has momentum with brand loyalists, something critical to Apple's success.  Now all they would need is a well designed line of hardware.
Some updates on GME
Disclaimer: I am not a professional and this is not investment advice. I am long GME (216 shares cuz poor) and   ing.  This post is for those of you who are new and asking about why people are still holding in this stock. It represents my personal opinion, often backed up by facts, but also including theorizing. This is all in addition to the original DD+updates, which can be viewed here:              # 1) Institutional Ownership of GME is over 100% of the float.  Blah blah blah, what's the big deal? Well consider this for a moment. If we assume that these institutional shares are essentially not in daily play (not exactly true because some of them are shares held for smaller accounts or whatever, but ignore that because diamond hands probably hold an equivalent amount to that portion), and we go ahead and assume that those institutional shares cannot be bought to cover a short (which they can but not easily/not quickly)   EVERY SINGLE SHARE TRADED ON THE MARKET IS A SHORTED SHARE THAT IS OWED TO SOMEBODY.  That's right, every single share traded on the market is ACTUALLY AN IOU. That's INSANE. And for every share we (as retail investors) buy, that's an ADDITIONAL IOU.  I literally can't overstate how insane this is. This isn't just a short squeeze where there aren't enough   are literally LESS THAN ZERO UN-SHORTED SHARES TRADED. This goes so far beyond a liquidity issue, I honestly don't know how clearing houses are even functionally capable of obtaining GME shares anymore. This thing will explode soon, because every share bought is just compounding IOUs at this point (on avg, obviously).  Forget the moon....          to some kind of permanent orbit.  # 2) Price movement during the meteoric rises  On Monday, Jan 25th, we had some huge spikes but only slightly positive movement. On Tuesday Jan 26th, price slowly climbed at an almost perfect line. This, I believe, was some shorts carefully, slowly covering and/or retail buying excitedly and/or a gamma squeeze due to the unexpected situation where every call from the Friday before ended up being ITM. Then between Tuesday and Wednesday, price   SHOT up afterhours from $150/share to $350/share  . Bloomberg had an interesting article regarding how approx. only $45m was needed for this price movement. On Wednesday, Jan 27th, the stock essentially traded sideways, with some big volatility. Then on Thursday, Jan 28th, many brokers suddenly restricted the ability to buy GME and the price fell sharply, but then rose again with additional movement after hours (likely MM's covering the newly ITM calls before Friday, perhaps some shorts covering). On Friday, Jan 29th, a twitter account belonging to one "Kjetill Stjerne" who may or may not be a reclusive Viking billionaire, tweeted that they would "hold the line" in light of the brokers closing and posted a bash script with a piece including something like "hunt=shortsells". While nobody can confirm if this is true (though he was for sure someone early on the GME boat, we don't know if he's actually wealthy, etc), all of us who watched the Level II Data stream on Friday saw that many of the ladder attacks (aka, rapid share dumps and/or shorts, below ask price and sometimes below bid price) were suddenly stopped when compared to previous days, and the stock, while very volatile, closed at $325 (essentially, sideways movement again, but with huge spikes/dips) leaving lots of call options ITM.  After Friday, the stock dropped starting Monday. It closed Monday at 225, and Tuesday at 90. I believe this was due partially to people selling (and panic selling), but also due to people shorting. It's important to note that volume was HIGHEST DURING the Friday before last, and then last Mon/Tue. Once the stock rose above $325, volume stayed relatively low and dropped until Tuesday.  What does all this mean? My opinion is that the spike was artificial. Someone intentionally raised the price using afterhours movements (why? I can hand-wave and give some   it's all speculation), and opinion of the stock was high enough to sustain that high price for a little while. Once that was evident, brokers across the board suddenly restricted the ability to buy shares (not just Robinhood), likely due to increased clearinghouse requirements, thus locking out retail investors. I personally also believe the Viking was legit, and he's the reason the price stayed up on Friday in the absence of retail buying, but that's my personal opinion. Which brings us to discuss the broker restrictions:  # 3) Broker Restrictions    IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THIS     :    This chairman of IBKR, one of the brokers said this: "We are concerned about the ability of the market and the clearing systems, through the onslaught of orders, to continue to provide liquidity. And we are concerned about the financial viability of intermediaries and the clearing houses". In other words, there were so many shares of GME traded that it seems they were having   TROUBLE TO FIND THE SHARES and/or THE CASH TO BACKUP TRADES  . He also talked about how he "saw this squeeze going to infinity and so they stopped it to prevent losses". So brokers began to call margins on margin accounts, liquidating stock and options, sometimes very conveniently at the lowest price of a dip. E-toro "accidentally" set automatic stop-limits. Robinhood restricted buying to one share, etc. etc. All of which led to a drying up of the BUY side of the books, allowing the SELL side to push price down far more easily than normal.  # 4) Media Manipulation  It has become blatantly apparent that the news media is generally ignorant of the situation, whether willfully or not. From articles about the "short squeeze" in NOK or BB (neither of which is significantly shorted), to an endless litany of articles about how "reddit" or the "reddit army" has moved to Silver despite only a single post in the sub about it, or Biotech, etc. The silver one is my favorite because EVERYONE reported   it was practically absent from this sub. Smells really fishy.  Ever since Wed, Jan 13th, the media has been reporting that "the short squeeze has happened."  The best examples, in my opinion, is if you watch the "new" articles after doing a Google search of "GME." You'll find that in general, whenever GME starts to rise, there are suddenly "new" (not actually new but updated so that they look like they came out just now) articles bashing on Gamestop, retail traders, the "frenzy", WSB, or speculation in general. (my personal opinion, based on what I've seen)  # 5) Bot accounts  There's been a massive influx in this sub of   that seem to generally be negative on the GME situation.     These are a general summary of the reasons that people feel like it's still worth holding GME.  If the news article writers tried harder to find the truth (please, DM me, I'll help), instead of blatantly making things up (re: Silver squeeze, NOK squeeze, BB squeeze, other "next targets of Reddit", Qanon comparisons, etc);  if Citadel (a market maker) didn't give a loan to Melvin (a huge GME shorter);  if Citron research hadn't tweeted on Jan 19th that they would discuss reasons for shorting GME (  the next day  ) just as GME dipped suddenly during a rise (and then postponed it because they forgot about the inauguration)  proceeded to give REALLY unconvincing reasons.  if people didn't see evidence of attempted stock manipulation in this subreddit by new accounts;  if the price movements weren't extremely suspect and rapid;  if there wasn't constant reporting about "shorts have definitely already covered" for weeks;  if we hadn't seen hundreds of articles about how WSB traders could never understand the fundamentals (while I've seen more fundamentals in the DDs here than in any news article about GME);    if brokers almost across the board hadn't SUDDENLY restricted the ability for retail investors to BUY but not SELL shares and/or options  ;  if institutional ownership wasn't over 100%, and shorters hadn't been so greedy as to short up to 138% of float (it's lower now, but it's still   insanely   high imo);    and finally IF there wasn't a convincing turn-around story and evidence of it;      Then people (including myself) wouldn't be holding. This is my summary of what I feel are the pertinent points relating to GME atm. Feel free to buy, sell, hold the stock as you see fit, this is not financial advice.    Don't ever buy stock/options with money you can't afford to lose.
So what's up with AMC?
Most of the hype is on GME but does AMC have potential? I have a few shares at $9 and was just wondering if there was gonna be a squeeze for AMC

Which one are we buying, I work in Nokia and have monthly shares bought from my salary in the HE   Should I change to NYSE or buy some ? What's the difference?
Peace Plan in which the Palestinians would have their currency placed on equal footing with the US dollar
Another idea that could be appended to what has already been presented would be having the Palestinian currency pegged inversely to the value of oil.... along with its inclusion into the Special Drawing Rights. This would mean that any decision by the Palestinians to fire on Israel would become directly tied to the global economy and the value of the Palestinian currency. Since the threat of war in the Middle East is often followed by a rise in the demand and value of oil, any hostility from Gaza(as the epicenter of mid-east conflict) could effect the price of oil by raising its value, which would thus(in turn) lower the value of the Palestinian currency that's pegged inversely to it. This implies that aggression would have a direct negative implication to the Palestinian economy. In any event, the control over the printing or minting of this currency should be allotted to the Palestinian authorities. This way the peace process directly incentivizes the Palestinians not in terms of land, but in terms of global economic clout since their currency would be intricately tied to world peace and climate change solutions, thus putting some checks and balances on currencies whose value is directly tied to the value of oil and the war machine. The global movement that is trying to get away from war and pollution is something that would easily aid the global demand for this new Palestinian currency.

This is our Valley Forge moment
February 4 1778. Dear Ma and Pa, I write you today at our darkest hour. The   is quiet now, the autistic screeching died down with the latest snowfall. Morale is fading by the hour. Deserters have left our lines in recent days, some have even defected to the   of Lord Melvin. Frostbite plays havoc even with diamond hands it seems. This precious revolution may be on its last legs: our supply lines are in disarray, even the support of the Duke of Cramer may have come too late for us. If we die here in the winter of our discontent, remember us. Honour our leader, George DFV Washington, and fight on in our stead so that the embers of liberty do not die with us. Your retarted son.

Sold slow moving index ETFs to buy more GME. Lady
I've been building up my savings accounts slowly through the years, nothing big but enough to get settled comfortably for my future. All this craziness has turned my view upside down and made me realize all the rules I thought mattered, don't. Because if you don't take a stand and take risks, you're just going to be taken advantage of by the 'big wigs'. That said, I'm still playing it safe to not completely fuck myself over. This is about calculated risks, taking a stand, and making some fucking money!   Let's do this gentlemen retards. I still have faith in what I'm seeing.   Also... The fuck was that article about women not being in this?!   The hedges think they can call sexism and all the feminists will tear down the server for them? Hahaha.
GME could find its place.
To all the peoples still holding, chances of it going to 400+ again soon are slim. However Amazon‚Äôs game business is failing. The real hope for any of us holding is amazon buying a cheap game distributor like GME to beef up the brand. They have renewed brand loyalty too thanks to this so it makes it an attractive buy for a large company trying to create a loyal base in a suffering business of theirs. Well a fella can hope. Either way.     and such. To the moon       this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.
Moving my funds from Robinhood. Need recommendations
After what happened with GME, I really don‚Äôt feel like giving Robinhood anymore of my business. What are some pros/cons to other services you guys use. I‚Äôve been doing a little research of my own but you know they all say their app is the best. Just looking for some suggestions. Thanks.

Is Holding the Line Enough?
I'm not someone who was introduced to investing or WSB from the GME craze, but I have never been more than a lurker until now. I have been watching this battle from the sidelines since the beginning of the month, and after seeing all the trading restrictions going on last week I decided to buy the dip on principle.  With that said the powers that be have managed to drive the price down, and even though GME at 90-100 is still a huge difference from where it was at the start of the year its a far cry from the highs it was driven to.   I have no actual facts to support this but I would have to imagine the institutions that were short GME at 20 have taken advantage of the dips to get out of those positions and that plenty of institutions were happy to open new short positions when it was pushing 300+  If that happens to be the case aren't those shorts already extremely profitable and not threatened to close that position whatsoever if the price were to plateau? Would a true autist bless me with an explanation of how holding the line here can still force a squeeze in a battle of attrition?
FYI: You might want to read the news.
Sorry to burst your bubble. But, in all likely hood, the shorts are covered. You guys aren't actually fighting anyone. Do some DD somewhere other than this sub reddit.     yeah, downvote the nay sayer! How dare they! Next I'll sell my right kidney to buy more GME!  \ EDITFYI, I'm seeing share trades being lifted on GME and it is down 10% as of the time I write this.  Also, I guess I need to say it because who knows right? This is NOT finanical advice. I'm not in anyway a financial advisor. I'm just a dude who lost money on GME and would like to be a voice of reason. Dont buy stocks based on information on reddit. It's probably the worst possible place to go to do DD.
Hindenburg Research Hit Piece on $CLOV
These ass clowns are trying to spread FUD about Clover Health.. What do you think we should do about it? It be a shame if, Idk, these shorts got squeezed?
Why I'm "bag" holding my GME shares
I'm  not . I'd only be bagholding if the company is going bankrupt--it's not going bankrupt, duh.  Do you know why gaslighters are trying to get you to sell? So they can buy back in for the same price or even cheaper from you, effectively meaning you just gave them free money. These retail fuckers are just as oily as Wall St. Look into the company yourself and stand by your convictions.   What I see: Well first,   the squeeze has no squoze  ; idc what people try to tell you, that's a fact & they lying. Second, maybe more importantly, a company turning around with a potential to become a gaming   monopoly   under the new management team. (Think about it, how many car brands are there trying to get into EV that $TSLA have to compete with? Now how many retail gaming brand is there that's as big and cemented household name vying for e-sports as $GME? Right.) Know your worth. Invest what you can afford to lose. Don't regret.  TL;DR Diamond hands. Trust. Don't @ me.  I'm not a financial blahblah.

Serious post: to the 7 million new frens posting here because they saw some memes and opened a brokerage account with next months rent payment
WSB was originally small-ish and everyone knew what the plays they made were gambles. Everyone knew you would probably not come out ahead. ONE successful play happens and everyone gets pushed out by a flood of 7 million+ retards who don‚Äôt even have any idea what they‚Äôre talking about. They‚Äôre just blindly repeating what another equally retarded person told them.   It‚Äôs gotten bad enough that now I constantly overhear people in public talking about options trading when they clearly have no fucking clue what they‚Äôre on about. So here‚Äôs a few things:  1) ‚Äúhaha you can make so much money selling calls on GME it‚Äôs crazy‚Äù   Because volatility is high as fuck and only an idiot would want to sell calls on an outcome so uncertain. Your loss selling uncovered calls is infinite. ‚ÄúJust sell covered calls‚Äù they say. What‚Äôs the reason you‚Äôd sell a call? Because you expect the price to go DOWN. Selling a covered call means you have to hold shares of the stock you are betting on going down so congratulations retard, you aren‚Äôt making money, you‚Äôre just minimizing your total loss. JUST because you sold some contracts and collected $10k in premium DOESNT MEAN YOU MADE 10k.  2) OMG  insert broker here  is fucking garbage and is in the pockets of  insert big business here   Actually it‚Äôs probably because retards like you who have no idea what they‚Äôre doing are making dangerous plays and they know they‚Äôll be stuck with the bill when your naked calls expire and you owe fucking $700,000. It‚Äôs basically them staring at a monkey operating a chainsaw and saying ‚Äúfuck man, you are actually so stupid that I am legitimately scared for my own safety. I‚Äôm taking away your petrol canister‚Äù.   3 ‚Äúomg you can make so much money buying options‚Äù  You can yes. If you make the right play at the right time. These contracts are intended to be used as a tool for hedging, not a fucking investment in of themselves. If you fully understand the math behind them (you don‚Äôt, because if you did, you wouldn‚Äôt have just joined WSB in the last 3 weeks because of some random ass meme on Reddit) then there are some scenarios to justify making a gamble with options. For most people they‚Äôll get lucky and just lose 100% of their investment. Some people won‚Äôt have any clue what they‚Äôre doing and expose themselves to potentially greater loss than $ they even had in the first place. See that one guy who sold $3500 worth of options to make a quick buck and ended up losing $700,000 and having to sell his house when they expired ITM.   4 the landscape is always changing  You can‚Äôt hang on to the same old DD that worked last month going forward on meme stonks. Past performance does not predict future performance etc. etc. Don‚Äôt marry your stonks.  tl;dr YOU ARENT A FUCKING STOCK WIZARD BECAUSE YOU READ A SUBREDDIT THAT IS THE FINANCIAL EQUIVALENT TO SUCKING YOUR OWN DICK IN THE SHOWER EXPECTING IT TO MAKE UP FOR YOUR LONELINESS. STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS SHIT IN PUBLIC OR TO YOUR GIRLFRIENDS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO LAUGH AT YOU WHEN YOU TRIP AND FALL IN THE SHOWER AND BITE YOUR OWN DICK OFF.
Why buy GME now

So unfortunately, still on Robinhood.  Ive noticed that they appear to have been progressively lowering the amount for which you can sell GME for. Ive had precious limits of 5k canceled.  Then placed 3k.  That was canceled the following day.  The highest limit today is 1500.   I tried other stocks worth $25 and placed a 10k per share limit which was accepted. Why do you think this is?   Not financial advice. You do with your money what you please. Just a question.
Vote With Your Wallet
Fellow Retards,  I like many of you am making the switch to a more robust broker. After reading through many of the comments on this sub, and other finance related subreddits I have found a common theme. For all the things RH has gotten wrong, they were certainly very right in their graphical user interface. Seeing as how we have strength in numbers, perhaps we could influence our new Boomer broker overlords to keep up with the times.   I've written and submitted a short paragraph to the technical support side of Fidelity in hopes that we can come together and reform the way they allow us to view and manage our money.     I've copied it below as a template for you smooth brained mongoloids to copy and or refine.      Good Afternoon,  I am writing in hopes of influencing Fidelity to update their current user interface between their mobile and desktop platforms. You are in the unique position of gaining a greater footprint of traders due to recent miss-steps carried out by your competitors. Fidelity is capturing a new wave of younger more technologically savvy investors who want powerful and elegant tools to empower their trading potential. We as the consumer have voted for you with our wallet. It is my hope that you place a greater deal of time and attention into the user interface to ensure you keep up with and stay ahead of your competition.     \- Mentally Challenged Ape     Oh... and GME to the moon
Tesla overvalued? Or auto industry undervalued?
First, I apologize for the non-GME related post. Just a thought I had. We all know about the rise of papa Musk and sweet sweet Tesla. Boomers have been saying it‚Äôs overvalued for the last I don‚Äôt know how long, or in a bubble (which, in all reality could be true).  However, with automakers such as GM pairing with Microsoft, Ford pairing with Google, and Hyundai pairing with Apple, more and more traditional car companies are finally hopping on the EV bandwagon.   This got me thinking. Companies like Ford and GM have hundreds of thousands of employees, but Ford‚Äôs market cap is literally half of NIO‚Äôs (who has 7,000 employees). It‚Äôs hard to justify, in my mind at least.  I get there are a lot of limiting factors for traditional car companies, but the sheer infrastructure that these traditional automakers  have in comparison to these other startups gives them a HUGE advantage.  But now that these guys are finally making their own EV‚Äôs, I think investors are starting to notice. Again, GM stock is at an all time high, and I think Ford will be there pretty soon. I am personally buying Ford because I loved their new bronco and think they may have a little something extra up their sleeve as well in the near future.  I have seen posts like this justifying why Tesla is overvalued, but very rarely that the rest of the industry is undervalued. And I also get Tesla is technically an ‚Äúenergy company‚Äù and blah blah blah. What do y‚Äôall think? Am I stupid?  Obligatory rockets:                   F 2/19c
GME: Lessons Learned
Many of you won't like this, but many more of you lost your shirt on GME.   This discussion needs to be had sooner or later.   Positions:  GME $300c 1/21/22 GME $300p 1/21/22  A few lessons I learned.  1 DFV is a legend. I wish I had 1/1000 of the foresight he had   2 This place is a circle jerk echo chamber. Nothing new. But if you get caught up in it you will get burned.    3 We are 90% gambling. Nothing more. Which can be a lot of fun.   4 We have been infiltrated and things will not go back to normal. We need to be careful about outside attempts to influence since they are now among us.
What app do you guys recommend should I want to join in on this madness
Let me start with, I'm dumb as a box of rocks and to be honest don't really understand whats happening or why.  I have seen Robin Hood mentioned often (app is not available in my country) then the etoro thing with them limiting the stocks.  Does it matter what app you use or not? This would be my first time dabbling into stocks so any good advice would be welcome  Edit: I live in the netherlands

Synergy   noun the interaction of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.  It‚Äôs been a wild ride thus far but it isn‚Äôt over. I‚Äôm not shaming anybody for getting out.. you have your own shit to take care of.. but for those still in and growing worrisome.. just look at the impact we as a group have had. Look at the light we‚Äôve shed on this whole situation. A few million retards on the internet have brought together people literally worldwide. My mother who graduated from a class of 17 people in rural Arkansas is asking me how to buy stocks. Even if GME is dead (it‚Äôs NOT) you‚Äôve gained millions of brothers and sisters who are fighting on your side. Even if I don‚Äôt see the tendies I‚Äôm considering my 5 shares @   my ticket to play a role in the most impactful financial movement the working class has ever had in the market and I‚Äôm prepared to lose it all because I believe in every one of you retards. Everybody loves tendies but sometimes you can‚Äôt put a price in being part of something bigger than yourself. Don‚Äôt forget where we started. This is WallStreetBETS. I love all of you.
NOK Surpasses Wall Street Expectations
The results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 12 cents per share.  The technology company posted revenue of $  billion in the period.  For the year, the company reported a loss of $  billion, or 49 cents per share, swinging to a loss in the period. Revenue was reported as $  billion.
Just stop
Fellow retards,  I know that we are all very excited with what's going on with GME, AMC, NOK and BB but... can we pull it together? There is way too much spam and fake hype going on lately. We don't need 200 post a day to know that we are long on this stonks. There is a lot of DD out there and this simply counterproductive. We created momentum without the spamming and we can do it again, just be patient.  Not financial advise just a fellow retard trying to read through all this crap.  Fuck the shorts
The time to average down is almost over...
I see so many posts of people sitting with averages of 300$ and more, what are your reasons to not average down?  Is it that there is no ammo left or is it wavering support?  I have bought my first 2 shares at 350‚Ç¨/ea and averaged down to 140‚Ç¨ holding 14. I know its not much but i cannot understand how y'all retards don't get that av down.

Edit: jeezus fuck guys, it was 180 something bucks and y'all acting like I just shat on your favorite grandmother. Calm down you fucking clowns, I'm playing this just like the casino and not spending what I don't want to lose. I'm having fun and learning more about trading, that's worth the money by itself.

CNBC and Squawk Box think it is over and feel bad for us
Listening to Squawk box on my way into work. They are starting to feel bad for us, because they think it is over! They had the president of NYSE on, and he laughed when bringing up reddit investors, and said he feels bad that we learned the hard way of how tough the market can be. Total disregard that what the hedgies did was extremely illegal. They also went after the GOAT, DFV, making fun of his headband and wrists straps. These fuckers really are starting to piss me off with their smug bullshit. I aint SELLLING!

$1,100,000 PURPLE Mattress YOLO update
Alright ladies and Gents here is my   dollar position as well as my reasoning on why I think it is a safe bet.  TL:DR - Buy 2023 leaps, Sell 35 or   puts, buy shares. I recommend selling puts for safety.              # The Hypothesis   Many of you followed some previous posts on PRPL and have made a money, some of you partook in the great nrpling in the summer of 2020 and lost some money.  This update will be quick. I have reduced my total dollar exposure to PRPL but my exposure is now heavily leveraged with options.  Purple recently touched   per share and has since made a pull back into the 33-37 dollar range. I believe that the next leg up will require a catalyst and I believe there are 2-3 catalysts coming up. I believe 40 is going to be a short term support level and 50 is attainable by year end.  # The Catalysts    PRPL is on the cusp of opening a new factory      Joe Megibow indicated it would open in February and 1-2 machines would come online almost immediately.      I expect a press release will occur when this happens   PRPL will release a business update      Purple didn't give guidance in their november Q3 call. I believe they will issue something soon and if they don't then their conference call will likely occur in the next 5-6 weeks.   New Partner announcement      I believe Purple is going to lean hard into wholesale this year as it has proven very profitable.      A nationwide partnership with Mattress firm would be a catalyst. Currently Purple is in about 800 of mattress firms \~3000 or so stores.   Analyst Upgrades      WE recently received big upgrades from Oppenheimer, B Riley and Merrill Lynch. I expect 3-4 upgrades in the coming weeks.  # The professional price Target - 10 analysts, 10 buy ratings        # The Growth Projections don't line up with the massive capacity expansion          Prpl ended 2020 with 7 Machines and Joe Megibow indicated 4 machines would come online in 2021 with the possibility of a 5th and 6th also coming online.   PRPL indicated they would be looking for their 3rd factory in 2021 as they would continue to expand.   I estimate that Purple will conservatively have \  machines worth of capacity for 2021 and optimistically   machines worth of capacity. This would lead me to believe purple will likely achieve   of potential revenue. For sake of projections I will assume they guide on the lower end and over deliver, like always.   Purple will likely end 2021 with   in capacity going into 2022.   Purple has grown from 5M in revenue in 2015 to nearly 700M in 2020...... Dear lord, if you don't understand how impressive this is for a damn mattress company then GTFO.         # Total addressable Market and strong online presence    Mattress industry is estimated to be 15-20B dollar business in the USA. PRPL currently has about 3% of the market.   Purple is in \~ 1800 American furniture stores but there are more than 30,000 potential stores.      On average I believe that each furniture store contributes about 250 dollars per day to Purple's  top line. By my estimates, purple could achieve another   in revenue just by expanding wholesale further.       .   Purple is once of the best known brands and although they only have \~3% of the market, the have a disproportional amount of brand awareness on social Media. Purple's advertisements have achieved over 2B in views due to viral marketing.      Purple hasn't even scratched the surface of other products such as travel pillows and other comfort tech such as ergonomic pads, etc. A travel pillow alone could increase revenue drastically.  Purple continues to have strong web traffic growth.        # The Moat    Purple has \~100 patents on their products   Purple's biggest competitor licenses purple's tech.... Think about that.   Purple is digitally native and has vast digital presence and is continuing to improve Cost of acquisition.   PRPL sources most products domestically and they were less affected than most bed manufacturers when the spring shortage occurred in 2020.     Be safe out there. This isn't advice and not all of you can get behind a mattress company, so do your owns research. This is my position as I believe purple will continue to grow healthily even with macro trends being unfavorable.
A fantastic ETF trade (FTSE100 ETF but Americans can/should get involved too)
Ok autists, please be gentle (as you can be) as this is my first DD ‚Äì having had double my usual adderall dose this morning (prescribed btw) I‚Äôm ready to write my magnum opus.  Obligatory Disclaimer 1 ‚Äì this has nothing to do with GME, I‚Äôm not encouraging anyone to divest their GME holdings. This is a medium-term play anyway so all you GME holders without extra cash can wait to see your short squeeze thesis play out and then come into this in a few weeks or whenever. Oblig Disclaimer 2 ‚Äì this is not financial advice of any kind, please do your own research. I am not a financial advisor, I do work in the US as a risk quant for a pension fund (not a hedge fund) but the fund does not invest in any of the below and I personally make no investment decisions, hence being able to post this.  Brief bit of info/background on me ‚Äì I‚Äôm a cross-Atlantic cross-breed,   an American-British kid. 30 years ago my dad went to the US on business and met my mom who was working as a cocktail waitress (no she wasn‚Äôt a stripper or working at Hooters before you ask). I‚Äôm also 30 years old myself so draw your own conclusions about my backstory (just keep them to yourself pls). Oh yeah, as a kid a child psychologist diagnosed me as mildly on the spectrum (for real) but I think she was full of shit really. Other than that I‚Äôm a pretty boring/ordinary guy generally. My investment thesis is anything but boring however.  Moving on to the idea (you don‚Äôt care about me or my backstory anyway). Actually before then let‚Äôs talk a bit about the UK (or ‚ÄúEngland‚Äù as you Americans always call it in movies). I‚Äôm sure you guys think us Brits all sit around in tweed coats drinking tea and acting like Hugh Grant or the cast of the Crown, but in reality the UK today is pretty Americanised (London anyway). London is also the biggest financial centre in the world after New York, our banks are up there with your big boys JPM, Citibank etc. Also Oxford University (rivaling Harvard) just invented a Covid vaccine.  So onto the investment. Currently I have a significant amount of my portfolio in a 3x leveraged ETF in the FTSE 100 (index of the largest 100 UK companies, equivalent of your Dow 30 really). As a British (as well as American) citizen, I can trade this domestically on Hargreaves Lansdown, but I‚Äôm sure you guys have access to various ETFs that give you the same exposure (Wisdomtree for example).  Despite the vaccine and strong recovery/quantitative easing, the FTSE 100 is still down -20% from its pre-Covid peak, in stark contrast to the DOW or S&P 500 which is at its all-time high. So why is this? Good question ‚Äì let‚Äôs look at some of the biggest constituents of the FTSE 100:  \- BP ‚Äì remember these guys, the villains from the Deepwater Horizon movie? Remember John Malkovich in his bad Southern drawl saying ‚Äúwe are a $115bn company‚Äù? Well currently their market cap is $50bn, so there‚Äôs huge potential upside. Yeah sure electric cars are coming along, but in reality oil is going to be still needed for a helluva long time, especially once air travel comes back. Plus oil is also used in plastics and pretty much every consumer material out there, it‚Äôs going nowhere anytime soon.  \- Royal Dutch Shell ‚Äì same as above, except they don‚Äôt have a movie about them starring Mark Wahlberg  \- HSBC ‚Äì seventh-largest bank in the world. Up until recently their share price was the lowest it‚Äôs been since 1995, despite these guys making bucketloads of money in normal times. Also if HSBC ever go under, that means the world financial system has basically ended. So this investment not working out will be the least of your issues  \- Barclays ‚Äì same as above, except they don‚Äôt have any issues/concerns with being exposed to Hong Kong/China. Also their investment bank has been making out like bandits this year due to the volatility. No idea why the share price is so low.  \- Lloyds Banking Group ‚Äì as above, another autist made a good DD post on here about LBG recently. Look that up as the adderrall is wearing off so can‚Äôt be arsed to repeat what he said.  \- IAG/British Airways ‚Äì huge airline that‚Äôs obviously struggling right now. But they have tons of cash and will definitely make it out of this crisis. Also down around -50% from pre-Covid highs.  \- Unilever ‚Äì the guys who make soap and washing-up liquid. Everyone will always need these (well maybe not the filthy autists on here like me)  \- AstraZeneca ‚Äì they just invented a highly effective Covid vaccine. Enough said.  \- BHP ‚Äì huge miner, $200bn valuation. They are actually trading above their pre-Covid highs but likely have more room to grow.  \- British American Tobacco ‚Äì the Covid pandemic hasn‚Äôt cured addiction, people won‚Äôt stop smoking anytime soon. If anything it might go up as people are stressed by the pandemic.  The above are just a few (the biggest) examples of amazing value stocks in the FTSE 100. Of course this is WSB not r/investing, so we need some additional risk. That‚Äôs why I would suggest a leveraged ETF, to  your returns. (Disclaimer ‚Äì leverage also  your losses, please don‚Äôt invest money you can‚Äôt afford to lose).  Ok, you say, well what about the white elephant in the room   Brexit? Well this is WSB not r/politics, so I won‚Äôt say that Brexit was a monumentally stupid decision by our elected leaders. But whilst Brexit will undoubtedly cause pain for the UK economy as a whole, the impact is mainly on smaller companies and businesses. Most of the constituents in the FTSE 100 are $5-10bn+ companies, for example banks are big enough that the legal expense of setting up a European entity is minimal (so they still get unfettered access to the single European market). So FTSE 100 companies shouldn‚Äôt feel much pain from Brexit in my opinion, at least not enough to affect this thesis.  Well what about the exodus/brain drain of finance and other professionals to Europe, you might ask? Well Paris is nice but French labour laws mean you can basically never be fired or made to work late, which doesn‚Äôt really work for most big companies. Frankfurt is a strong contender to London‚Ä¶ except it‚Äôs one of the most boring cities out there. Imagine moving from New York to Fargo, North Dakota ‚Äì except that everyone in Fargo spoke a different language (although judging from the TV show it seems like they may do anyway). That‚Äôs what it would be like for someone moving from London to Frankfurt (sorry Germany/Fargo).  Ok, so what‚Äôs the risk level of this trade? Well tbh I would say the risk/reward ratio is really good ‚Äì with a leveraged ETF you could conceivably make 100%+ returns in the next few weeks/months. And thinking about it this is really almost risk-free ‚Äì if the FTSE 100 tanks or stays low for the next year or two, in reality that means we‚Äôre all still sheltering inside and now living in the monstrosity of a film that was Michael Bay‚Äôs ‚ÄúSongbird‚Äù (plotline ‚Äì Covid has mutated to be 90% deadly and we are all still in lockdown in 2024). So at that point you‚Äôll probably be scavenging for food/focused on survival, even if money still exists I can guarantee you won‚Äôt be upset about any money you lost on this trade.  Oh yeah, also the FTSE 100 was down almost 9% last month (January). So investment timing is also on your side if you go into this in the near-future.  Autist out (again - pls do your own research this is all just my opinion/autism)    TL;DR:    \- Leveraged FTSE 100 ETF is a great way to make 50-100%+ returns over next few months with pretty low risk. Consists of huge oil companies, investment banks that aren‚Äôt going anyway but still down -50% from their peaks (for no other reason than we‚Äôre Britpoors)  \- If this goes tits up then we‚Äôre probably all still quarantined and living in Michael Bay‚Äôs Songbird world in 2 years‚Äô time, so money will be the least of your worries  \- Timing is on your side, the FTSE 100 dropped 9% last month for no discernible reason  \- Brexit is a risk but not that big an issue for these very large companies (see above in the detail)  \- If you don‚Äôt invest in this then you just don‚Äôt like money  \- GME holders don‚Äôt need to panic as this is a medium-term trade over a period of weeks (or even months) so plenty of time to hold your GME if you so choose and come in on this later  \- This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. Pls do your own research, this is all just my own opinion/autism.
$GoodMorningEveryone
or G. M. E. for short?  Give your fellow apes a hug or a squeeze today for another day of line holding!
Obviously the squeeze would be ideal, but think of the long term on GME.
Ok so lets say the hedges did some real sketchy shit and somehow the short interest is lower than we thought. We find out for sure next week but I'm thinking bigger than that. Cohen made chewy which is worth 40 billion now. He just brought in a shit ton of help and is overhauling gamestop which ALREADY HAS A MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. Lets say if gamestop becomes as valuable as best buy at 30 billion, it would then be worth $500 a share. Without the short squeeze. Honestly with or without the squeeze I'm just gonna hold my shares.   I originally bought 50@$15 because I liked the company and what Ryan Cohen had to offer. But like a paper handed bitch I sold a few on the way up. Well i bought it all back and much more to a total of 91$99 and I'm NOT SELLING   . Many would argue Gamestop is worth at least $100 ($6 billion market cap) based on fundamentals but we dont use that word around here. Trust Cohen and let him do what he does best. Make ballin ass companies worth tens of billions in a few years. The squeeze may happen in time like TSLA exploded over the course of all last year.  Also what's better than the greatest marketing scheme anyone could have ever come up with? Gamestop went viral and all the zoomers buying xboxes are gonna wanna buy them from Gamestop.  _Not a financial advisor just a retarded university student with 40% of his life savings in GME and dreams of retiring early._

Got your attention? Good. Now, listen the fuck up.  Know what makes WSB different from r/stocks or r/investing?  The fucking retarded amount of risk in each play. That's what brought me here initially and that's what'll keep this sub going. WSB is either HIGH RISK/HIGH REWARD or HIGH RISK/HIGH RETARD.  If you're posting shit here to "stick it to the man" with your 10 shares of GME or posting unrealized gains/losses, fuck off. You're just noise.

MY OPINION IS STRONG BASED ON WHAT I SAW UNRAVELING BEFORE MY OWN EYES LAST WEEK AND CONTINUING INTO THIS WEEK.
Best word of advice my old man gave me
Buy and forget it. Stop looking at it every five mins, we didn‚Äôt do this to get rich instantly. Shit don‚Äôt just happen and when people are on stand by, watching and waiting for us to give up. Hold it and don‚Äôt give up.  ü§ù
As much as everyone loves the hysteria of WSB, just a quick shout out to those who bought, set their sell order, and went back to their normal lives.
As much as I find this place entertaining, there's something to be said for just throwing some money at whatever equity you feel good about, and setting a sell order at a handsome return, and going back to doing something else.
According to Reuters "Yellen says wants to "understand deeply" GameStop frenzy before taking action" ... Anyone else thinking "she's waaaay too old to understand this", or am I too cynical?
What worries me is, that people will explain it to her who don't understand it either and because I highly doubt she ever even heard of reddit before this I don't think she will "get it".  And whatever decisions will come from this will be due to a falsely explained version of events?     So, how do you fellow retarded apes see this? Am I unfair and too cynical about this?
Chamath - Wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing
Chamath has been trying very hard to get public attention and fan following. He even uploaded his nude to show his chicken legs to stay relevant.   On one end, he seems to show that he is helping wsb and retail investor but on another end, he is selling junk to retards on this forum and everywhere.   He is a wolf in sheep‚Äôs clothing who will pounce on all of your money.   CLOV is a fraud. His GME stunt was a fraud and just used the opportunity to promote IPOE (SoFi) another junk.   5 years later you‚Äôll realise that my prediction was as good as u/DeepFuckingValue‚Äôs.   Dump Chamath and his shares.
I'm not   .
Because I stuck the stocks up my ass so the SEC would have to kiss it to get them.
Oddities with this mornings
Why all of a sudden are people with no post history posting all over this morning that we should all work together, we, organize, etc. Seems weird, idk. Be safe.
VISN just throwing it in here
Binovi - TSXV:VISN This company has been growing for a while with incredibly potential to explode but shorters have been killing it for a very long time. It still proves very durable to that but it's growth had been massively limited because the same issue as GME. Do what you want with this information.
4 horseman question
How many shares of GME, BB, AMC, and NOK do we expect the hedgies to still need? I'm down   and holding. Has anyone done the math on when the squeeze is most likely to occur?
Never selling because I like the stock!!!
But due to the recent turmoil and fuckery afoot with the sub I'll be going silent from wsb along with alot of other folks, just know we all have each other's backs.  Hold you beautiful idiots hold!!!
I figured out the reason we didn't go to the moon yesterday.
it's me.  after a lot of research and soul searching, I've come to realize that I am the bad luck. I cannot invest for the life of me. and before you call me what I am (  ) hear me out.  I started fucking with investing about 2 months ago and have been adding a bit of money into my Ether account and watching it grow. it was wonderful even if it was small growth. time went on and I started to gain interested so I took about $100 to play around with and see what I could do with it. In a month of casual investing I lost $40. that's not much but I tried my damndest to turn any type of profit. alas I only made bad calls. like really bad calls all the time. I would throw money into something and it would immediately fall like it had bricks on it's feet in the Marinas Trench. It didn't matter how long I held for.. a few hours, few minutes, few days, as soon as I took my money out, that fucker would float back up. this was a constant trend and sometimes I would just try to make even the tiniest amount of profit (like $  tiny) and was only successful like 3 times out of 50. I was bad luck. straight up. I even tried doing as much research on how to preform better with the free time I had. I still have A LOT to learn, I know that, but even the beginner strategies bit me in the ass.   So, the "first squeeze" happened and I figured since it was in the news it was already too late and I mostly ignored it. but then I got to reading on here over the weekend and got convinced that there was another one coming. so come monday morning I bought in at around $230 shares and I was excited as fuck. I even took out all my Ether (the only investment of mine that was doing well) to fund this madness. it wasn't much. only 6 shares in total (I bought 1 at $100 too) so I hold 7 now. and like you already know. monday was the beginning of the downfall that we see now. the real kicker. Ether hit an all time high today and my funds were being chopped in half in the meantime. I was crushed. to add insult to injury, I added another 1K to my Ether account to make up for what wasn't in there because I really believe in it. ONLY to take it out at what I thought was the peak of $1530 since it seemed to stall, and hope to jump back in at the drop. nope, it just kept rising and now I'm too scared to re-enter for fear that it will only fall again due to past luck.   so to summarize; every move I make in investing turns out to be a money loosing move, and my decision to pull out will likely be a money loosing decision in regards to loosing out on profit. I just know as soon as I pull out, weather it be now, or next week, you will all be fueling up to launch to the moon the next day.   I Am Really good at losing money.   with me here in the game you will all also loose money with me so I'm gonna opt out and bring the curse with me.   I don't play the stocks, the stocks play me.  hopefully you    retards will at least wave to me from the moon.
Why isn‚Äôt GME moving ?
Why the hell isn‚Äôt this stock moving from 90$ this is hard to watch . Are we getting dooped? Do they really have all the control ? How can we get the stock back up !?
$GME : WSB is a pilot fish in fight between funds
Hi,  As per rule :                  But you Apes need to remember that u are retards, but more importanter, that you are weighting between 2-5% of the 71 millions GME shares (following estimations done on the sub).  So holding or not, you are merely a pilot fish swimming around whales and funds, with little to no impact to the fight on the shorts, event more when RH broke your buying power.  My main question now, why we don't see more moves from the big wallets to squoze the squeeze ?
I‚Äôm tired of people saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to sell, we have to respect those who want off this ride‚Äù. FUCKIN RIDE OR DIE, DIAMOND HANDS BABY   üë∂
Selling now is NOT OK, stop saying you respect people who sell. I have no respect for people who sell. If you sell you‚Äôre a paper hands bitch who was never down for the cause.  Moon isn‚Äôt cool. You know what‚Äôs cool? Fucking Pluto baby, that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre going!  EDIT: So many paper handed shills coming at me in the comments and my DMs. Don‚Äôt fuckin @ me bro this is    thread only
I have no clue how stocks work, and no idea what I am doing.
I don't have a lot of expendable money, but I bought $100 worth of AMC stock and I am holding. I might lose it, but I love what you guys are doing. I will sink more in when I can.
Timeframe
Hey, small ape here holding strong with a question.  How big will the timeframe be within GME rockets to the moon and drops down again? I am very anxious to actually miss it.    üèª
I don‚Äôt feel so good...

Robinhood isn't done interfering
I have made several attempts to place limit orders at high prices because, from my understanding, it keeps RH from lending out my shares.  Each time, it is rejected one or two business days later.  This makes me think one of two things. 1. They are rejecting my limit orders so they can indeed loan out my shares. And/or 2. They are trying to remove my limit order so they can increase the chances of the squeeze not being bought at a high price.  If this is totally off base, I apologize. I'm just a smooth brained ape holding
WE'RE   PEOPLE HERE - IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE ALL BOUGHT MORE GME
Hi everyone,    I'm new here but have been interested in all this GME thing for quite some time already. I bought a few share last week - not a lot, but with money I am sure I can lose.      GME price is now more reasonable. We're   people in this group... It's nice to hold, but why don't we all buy more today ? Even for 50, 100$ (I mean, come on, I'm sure most of us can afford to lose a few dozens $). Would't the price of the stonk grow a lot, whether there is, or not, a short squeeze ?
Things I'm remembering.
So first off, I'm new to this sub reddit, I'm a know nothing moron who has been poor his whole life. This is not advice just what I'm thinking on.  Last week a hedge lost 53% of all there funds.  A billionaire got on National TV and cried because of $GME.  Cuban said he would hold and wait.  The repeated media   to manipulate people over to silver when we didn't budge.  I'm not sure about anyone else but these seem to be very telling to me.  I've only got 5 shares, it is what I could afford to lose if it goes belly up, but I'm going full             to the fucking moon!

Process for switching from Robinhood
Can anyone tell me the process for switching from Robinhood to another broker when I currently have investments though Robinhood?  Is this like a roll over?  Do I need to sell my shares and re-invest with the new broker?  Can you provide alternatives to Robinhood that you use or have switched to?  Thanks!

GME Second Wave
Hello, paste-eating apes of WSB,  There is a second wave of GME coming and here‚Äôs why: after hearing about you heroes on the news I decided to open an Etrade account (because this is the second time I‚Äôve seen Robinhood freeze its own clientele out of fat gainz), and those funds are taking 5 days to become available. Where am I going to invest? GME.   My point is I cannot be the only one who came late to the party but is ready to keep up the pressure on the hedgefund fuckers and buy GME.   More newbies like myself are ready to buy, get ready for part 2  , hold the fucking line.

One thing I‚Äôve learned in my many years on the market..... stocks only go up   amc   gme
Too much FUD, not enough
You have to ask yourself why there would be any fear or doubt when so much of the maths behind the stock market says HOLD. Before this sub exploded in size and we started to see fear mongering and diversion tactics on every corner, our stance was simple: all in with what you can afford and HOLD.  There is no reason why that should have changed, real reasons to exit can‚Äôt be found here, real reasons to exit do exist however and they include:  - rent and utilities; - medication and healthcare; - education; - family emergencies;   ‚Äôs it. If you have to fold make sure it‚Äôs not because of FUD, because of whatever BS the media is spinning or because of what has happened to this subreddit.  Stay strong, hold your    like a badge of honor, the more days that pass the worse the doubt will get but that‚Äôs what the HF‚Äôs and brokers are counting on.  HOLD THE FU KING LINE

TD Ameritrade is Routing all orders through Citadel now . . .
TD Ameritrade / Charles Schwab is now Conspiring with Citadel to send all order flow to Citadel so they can cover their massive shorts they made when RobinHood restricted buys. In the image below you used to be able to choose the exchange/route to use, but they disabled that, and stopped allowing limit sell orders that are still within the strike prices. The Entire Market is conspiring against us right now. Does anyone know a broker that doesn't route through Citadel?

The last few weeks in a nutshell
How the Hedgies Might be Decieving Everyone
The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù You can  .  The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:    If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.   A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.   The shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.   This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.   As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.   The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.  It gets very complicated, very fast.  But the gist is that hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they‚Äôve covered their shorts ‚Äî even if they haven‚Äôt truly covered, and can‚Äôt, for lack of available float ‚Äî by way of exploiting loopholes that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.     \ \ \ This is an excert, one of two possible explanations\ \ \   taken from       TLDR: Whats an exit strategy? Hold my sweet children and life will pay you what you ask of it.     Positions GME 67@95 & AMC

"BuT ThE PrIcE iS FalLiNg"
This should only mean buy more not sell, maybe you are new to this but people don't make money in two seconds from one stock. GME was a rare situation. Rome wasn't built in a day.  It can, im saying will, rise again just gotta wait it out. This may last til almost (maybe even) March. Dont complain and just sit on it. What we need is for you to do nothing, which is easy. Stop checking your accounts. Stop freaking out. Stop spending money you need for rent. Buy or hold, don't be the death of us.  Remember- This is going as exactly expected so far.    Edit- i'm a dumbass and dont know a fucking thing what im talking about. I legally have brain damage from huffing glue and a diet of only tendies. Just learned what a stock was twenty minutes ago and still not totally sure. Dont use this as advice i wrote it as a joke
What platforms allow for option trading upon opening your account?
I'm with Schwab and really like the platform, but have to go through an application process to trade options. Right now one of my accounts with them is approved at level 0, but it really just allows for covered calls and I want to start trading long calls. I put in an application but am impatient...      I have a Fidelity   honestly can't stand the platform.....     Anyone know any platform/app that allow for options trading upon opening?
Just HOOOOOOLLLDDD

What a know-nothing retarded skeptic such as myself is learning from the GME "Squeeze"
So, this last two weeks was my first week in my life ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù (legalized gambling really). ü•≥  &nbsp;  If I‚Äôm on WSB, it‚Äôs because all you autists are so fucking retarded that WSB has become the funniest place on the Internet. And because sometimes, despite (or because of?) the collective stupidity, I learn a lot.  &nbsp;   Like:   How to lose money   ü§ë üò≠. Quickly.  Seriously.  Learning how to lose money is so hard. I mean, I only invested about 3500 total. But still, thanks to you guys, managed to lose at least 1500!  &nbsp;  But seriously, thanks! Because for a measly 1500 greenbacks, as someone who has never, ever invested I learned:   - how to use a trading platform - how to read critically - how to place limit orders and not market orders  - how basic options works - how to navigate insane amounts of hype, stupidity, and propaganda (the SLVR, BB, NOK pushers, which were always obvious targeted distractions - how little power I have - how even less knowledge I have.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  So here are a few lessons (which I'm still learning) which I‚Äôd like to share with y'all.  1.   Be critical of everything   - There are not only a lot of shills and bots out there (I‚Äôm looking at you, $SLVR-pushers!) but there are, surprise surprise even more autists. Especially with 6 million new accounts of presumably people who have never invested in their live, but in classic Internet-style, already tout themselves as steel-balled market gurus. From people posting data that‚Äôs [fundamentally wrong] ( , fundamentally misinterpreted, or coming to conclusions without enough data or just plain old confirmation bias (basically, all of WSB). Special shoutout to [u/smohyee's] (  very [sober post] (  which helped me look critically at stuff that has been flying around the forum these last days.  2.   Don‚Äôt underestimate my ignorance   - I know nothing. Literally nothing. I can do basic addition and subtraction, and know stocks go up and down. Personally, the market seems like a huge insane bubble ready to burst at any second. But maybe not. What do I know?  ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm as autistic as you. ü§§  3.   Get in before the hype   - Even to my stupid, ignorant self, I realized buying GME at an all-time high of 150X its low, was a stupid idea. Especially when the entire Internet and even non-Internet media was buzzing with the hype.  3B. (Corollary). - If you are going to go up against a Hedge fund with is 10000X more powerful than you, don‚Äôt announce all your moves up front.     4.   Understand what the statistics and metrics mean before betting (I mean: "investing")   - People are posting volume data, short interest numbers, using fancy lingo and stats that I still can‚Äôt wrap my brain around (I still haven‚Äôt understood how you can sell a put you don‚Äôt have for example, that‚Äôs how ignorant I am). But, as the wise men & women say - ignorance is an opportunity to redeem yourself.  5.   Don‚Äôt underestimate all the other players   - Hedge funds, Retirement funds. Whales. They all have different agendas. And their agendas are not yours. The worst mistakes I saw were not acknowledging the special advantages that institutional investors will always have. This is not  cheating . This is how the market works. You can be a crybaby autist about it, but that‚Äôs how it is (I wrote a bit about some of the advantages even I saw that HF have  . Institutional Investors have sentiment trackers, high-speed algorithms, inside information, battle-hardened experience, tricky tactics, etc. You are not going to beat any Hedge Fund of Institutional Investor at a game they invented, made the rules in, and excel at.  6.   Expertise is valuable   - There is a very good reason why finance jobs, especially at Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity firms are the best-paid jobs in the world - because they places hire very fucking smart people, who work very fucking hard (7 days a week, 14-hour days), to be better at this than you or I. The expectation that we be as good as them, is like expecting to pop out of your mom‚Äôs womb and run a 100m faster than Usain Bolt without a day‚Äôs training. The reason we don‚Äôt like Hedge Funds or the stock market in general, is it is because it a casino for the wealthy. We are the poor schlubs sitting at the 1 dollar blackjack table, while watching the billionaires in their Tuxedos coming out of their Bentley‚Äôs to play at the million dollar poker tables. From a recent Economist article this week:  ‚ÄúEven in America stock market gains have mainly accrued to the rich. The wealthiest 1% owns 56% of the stock market, up from 46% in 1990; the top 10% owns 88% of the market.‚Äù   7.   The HF didn‚Äôt cheat. They don't need to. They hustled   - They invited ignorant newbies to sit at their tables (yes, that‚Äôs us), and then fleeced us of our cash. We are idiots, because we KNEW the hustle was coming and we KNEW the pros were pros, and yet we STILL played against them.  &nbsp; &nbsp;    Little reminders for myself for next time:    1.   Accept the risk   - Any money I gamble in this friggin casino I can count as lost. 2.   If you have no clue, don‚Äôt bet   - I have no clue what a ‚ÄúCalendar Call‚Äù or a ‚ÄúVertical Call‚Äù is. You can bet I won‚Äôt be making that, until I do. 3.   Losing (preferably a little bit) of money, is a very strong motivation to learn.    &nbsp;  And a li‚Äô tip for my fellow autists:    Don‚Äôt post fucking DDs if you are an ignorant shit.    &nbsp;  Positions - Holding 215 AMC (115 bought  (stupidly, and during the hype) @14; 100 bought during a dip @   Holding 2 GME (1 free from RH, 1 bought at 115) 1 SPY put 332; EXP 03/31  &nbsp;  Final final note (for real, this time):  &nbsp;     If you think the stock market is unfair, you are right. Unfair is the very core foundation of capitalism. If you really really are pissed off at capitalism and hedge funds, have the balls to be socialist or a marxist; refuse to participate in the free market; and refuse to consume.   &nbsp;  Be Bartelby!

A Little More Motivation
I know it was never the point of the GME movement, but every single day you hold? That's millions/billions that Melvin has to spend in "late-fees" for not paying back his shorts. We are literally draining his bank accounts, and that feels so damn good!   Ape. Together. Strong.
Now‚Äôs your time!
Now‚Äôs the time to sell if you want to make big cash and not lose everything. The first to sell will make the most. The last one out is a rotten egg.
I will hold
I am a single dad. I believe in you...everyone on here. This movement inspired me after losing so much during the recession. Sticking it to the man in this psychopathic way makes me laugh after a year being a nurse on a covid unit. After a terrible 2020 it is a resounding bit of hope for a new year. I am holding. I don't care about the money. I care about the movement. Buying c  to drink with you all as we enjoy our tendies.

Non ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù plays this week
Can we all take a break from the whole GME/AMC madness for 1 day with the understanding that we‚Äôre gonna hold the line and go back to throwing irresponsible amounts of money at weeklies?

DONT PLAY INTO THEIR HANDS AND FOLD NOW
Now gather up you smooth brained nothing to lose sons of diamond handed bitch ass step-daughters.    THIS. IS. ALL OUT. WAR.   They are trying everything to scare you off from giving in your shares! Thats IT. See why we are not back down to where we originally started by that I mean 10-20 dollars? BECAUSE WE HAVE THEM IN OUR GRIP. We are bleeding them and they are using every weapon they have. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO RUIN THE SUBREDDIT  BUT  the word is already OUT. If we hold and stay strong we are going to win this war. No matter what GameStop is still a heavily shorted company that requires our help to finish the shorts off for once and for all.   Do not let this price point that we are at right now scare you. I have jumped on this train at 20 dollars imagining it would take more than months to come to this price point where we are at right NOW!  Yes they killed our momentum for now BUT there are a lot of new positive news coming our way to help us get back onto that rocket and to the moon and BEYOND. There will be positive earnings, announcements such as Ryan Cohen becoming the CEO of the company and many more.  WE. JUST. HAVE. TO. WAIT. AND. HOLD  ü§ö (and BUY more stock if you could)  So don‚Äôt let other people scare you off from what you have and stay strong.

Please note I am not inciting a short squeeze I'm just telling people that I like SLV and why they should consider liking it too. I am not a financial advisor and we are all individuals acting of our own accord. If you want someone to investigate try investigating the hedge funds and corrupt brokers.       Before GME gang downvotes:  Listen up this isn't r/GME this is r/wallstreetbets I know you have your battles to buy but we shouldn't miss out on SLV just because you guys like GME still. OF course dont sell GME to buy SLV just hold and wait for the squeeze but we must recognise that SLV is ACTUALLY a legit play.     If you want to check that i'm not a robot send me captchas and ill do them for you     Recently there have been a few posts about SLV, but I tried to wait until the GME hypes has died down to post this. This DD will be split into two parts:  1. Why SLV in on itself is a good and safe investment (Boomer DD) 2. Why SLV has moon mission potential (WSB DD)    We should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in GME. You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.      The Boomer DD (Source:       Why silver is a good investment   Silver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.  Silver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.        Government inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.           Silver use in industrial production is also increasing.  There is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.  One key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.  Photovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it    On average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.         Silver supply is dropping   Silver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped  , silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.           So to conclude the boomer DD:  \- Inflation is on the rise  \- Too much money is being printed  \- Silver outperforms gold  \- Silver biggest use is industrial use  \- Silver demand is increasing  \- Silver supply is dropping    WSB DD            According to  , we would need silver to go to $500              Of course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )  I'm just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.  Also, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going "Hey guys i'm a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.  1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF's because they don't buy physical silver) 2. Silver price go up 3. JP Morgan ANGRY 4. Robinhood and other brokers experience "temporary outages", "Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason" , "Limiting SLV shares that can be bought" 5. WSB and noobs who don't know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something  Basically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.  Whether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it's heavily debated and I don't know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.  Maybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold       Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver    I have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is  \- One contract is too expensive  \- People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with it  \- Its taking attention away from GME      One contract is too expensive   The contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver  1. But silver futures and take delivery 2. Buy SLV shares 3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers  There are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don't believe me check for yourself.      People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees   See above      Its taking attention away from GME   I am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn't mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn't miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.          Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise      When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc      When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.      When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.         BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?    Almost every household owns some silver. Whether its' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don't know.  If silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.  Poor people don't how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don't know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don't have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don't have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with "What is a broker" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say "Buy silver lol" than "Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose...."  If you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don't transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.  TLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don't need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \[When you don't pay for a product you ARE the product\])  Regardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.

$GME Short Interest Data.
Hi everyone,  I keep seeing comments/questions about short interest. I use Ortex & S3 to get a read on trends. From my experience, they are usually within 10% of the exchange reported interest.   Date High Price Estimated Short Interest Change in Short Interest   :- :- :- :-   3-Feb 114   (    2-Feb 158       1-Feb 322   (    29-Jan 414   (    28-Jan 483   (    27-Jan 380   (    26-Jan 150   (    25-Jan 159       The hedge funds cleared a lot of short interest from Jan 27-Jan 29. This caused $GME price to spike. They didn't do it all at once, but instead did it slowly. We saw a squeeze that looked more like rolling hills.  This week, they're playing a new game. They're holding their short position relatively flat & even doubling down.  Some will say these are people who shorted at $400 instead of $40. Unless you think hedge funds are fortune tellers, I think we can agree that the original 70M were closer to the $40-$80 mark. You see the kind of price pressure we see on the days where they cleared 9-15M? I do not believe they cleared the full 70M otherwise we would have seen more price pressure on surrounding days.  Thoughts?  I am not a financial advisor. This is my opinion.
I went into GME/AMC for the money, I'm staying for the cause
I don't care about the money anymore, I'm going to hold for the cause. It doesn't matter how high it goes now I'm keeping my shares just for the üñï to all the hedgefunds
Edward Diamondhands
Just made my first investment and bought a few shares of AMC... I have no idea what I'm doing, can someone please explain whats going on? I'm retarded.
So as the title says, I literally just started investing and bought a few shares of AMC. From what I can gather this seems to be a similar battle to the whole GME situation. So is the goal here to hold or is there some time that would be good to buy out and try to profit? What do the fine degenerates at r/wallstreetbets think? I could really use the help, as I mentioned before I am retarded.
BUY BLOCKBUSTER
HEY GUYS DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE NEW GME? IT'S BLOCKBUSTER!   DD: TURNS OUT FENCE FUNDS HAVE SHIRTED IT OVER 5000 % POSSIBLY HIGHER AND ALSO HAVE TO BUY IT BACK WITHIN SECONDS BUT ALSO CANNOT DO THIS UNTIL WE ALREADY BOUGHT ALL SHARES OR WATHEVER. CONCLOUSION NUCLEAR SQUIRTLE COMING IN.  ALSO VERY LIKELY JEFF BEZOZ AND HES FREND MELON TUSK BUYED A LOT OF BLOCKBUSTER SINCE HE LIKE MOVIS I HERD  Ps. (not financial advise. I'm from Sweden and not really sure what block buster is but I think it's something with movies. I don't own it and I won't buy it (unless someone on here says buy blockbuster), I don't know if there's even a stock though? I think so. I have very limited brain capacity and my handler just let me randomly smash the keyboard sometimes.)
I just want to thank WSB.
For those of us who have nothing and have felt trapped for quite a while, you have given us hope. Thank you for that.  It is the first time in a long time that I feel like I may be able to do something with my life and make something of myself.   That's all.
New to this subreddit, can't wait to buy Blockbuster $BLIAQ
I've never invested before, but with your guys' encouragement, I'm sure my first $2000 is going to go to Blockbuster $BLIAQ! Let's all stick it to the rich guys and buy Blockbuster $BLIAQ!!
Email from RH says they will close my ITM options for GME and AMC that expire tomorrow when they choose to.
Below is the email RH sent out to me. They says they will chose when to close out my options when they decide to if they are "IN THE MONEY" due to high volatility of these stocks.   THIS IS HOW THEY ARE PLANNING TO PREVENT GAMMA SQUEEZE.   For additional reference, I also have other options expiring tomorrow for other stocks, yet this email only mentions GME and AMC. They say they can do this because I don't have the money deposited to exercise.   I have 1 GME option expiring tomorrow for $260. (I also have shares before ppl start bitching).  They know these are going to      I plan to Deposit the money to cover exercise so they can't justify closing these the second they are ITM which is what will likely happen otherwise.   Email from RH:  Important information about your options expiring 2/5  Hi Kaitlin,  We‚Äôre reaching out to you because you have GME and/or AMC options expiring this Friday and our standard sellout procedures have been adjusted to account for increased volatility in the underlying equities.  Because of this, on Friday, your GME and/or AMC options expiring 2/5 may be at a higher chance than usual of being closed out if you are unable or choose not to close them out yourself.  We understand this may be frustrating to hear, but we want to be transparent with you and keep you informed.  How does this affect me?  If we determine that your option contract is at risk of being in the money and you don‚Äôt maintain the necessary collateral to support assignment/exercise, we may take proactive measures to help reduce your account risk, including closing at-risk positions prior to expiration date.¬†This may also include, but isn‚Äôt limited to, spread positions with a theoretical max gain/loss.  Please note that having the collateral to place the trade is different from having the collateral to support exercise/assignment.
The Quest For the Golden Fuckboy Award
I‚Äôve been on wsb as a lurker for a long ass time now, and proud to call my self a fellow smooth brain severally concussed autist.   I see people on here that may say I miss the glory days or thought they were here to get rich quick, and this reminded me of something. Where we came from. How truly retarded some of us really are. I mean seriously? x25 leverage!? GOD DAMN.  I was going through the awards at 1am and found a thread about tracking the ever so rare ‚Äúgolden fuckboy‚Äù award. What I found brought me hours of laughing and joy. Memories I didn‚Äôt know I had (that‚Äôs due to being a retarded ape with countless concussions).         The memories had here and the lives changed will never be forgotten. Wsb isn‚Äôt a sub Reddit, it‚Äôs a state of mind. It‚Äôs a group that will be passed down from generation to generation.   IN THE TENDIEMAN WE PRAY. SAVE OUR SUB.   All I‚Äôm getting at is as apes we have evolved. Don‚Äôt hate change. Change good. Simple brain know change =
Hindenburg coming after Chammath I guess. They just released a short report on CLOV
Link to the report!
I‚ÄôM NOT FUCKING SELLING
I see so much bullshit in this sub the last few days. Obvi a lot of it was bots before they instituted the 30 day rule but even now it‚Äôs either bitter paper handed bitches, paid shills, or bots that have been around a while.   Here‚Äôs the facts:  - THIS SUB BALLOONED FROM 2M DEGENERATES TO 8M IN A WEEK. THE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT ALL THE SHARES AT THE START OF THIS ARE NOW OUTNUMBERED 4:1. DON‚ÄôT BELIEVE WHAT‚ÄôS IN THE GME THREAD.   - ANY TIME I TALK TO A REAL PERSON ABOUT GME, THEY‚ÄôVE BOUGHT MORE. NOBODY I KNOW IS OUT.   - IF YOU INVESTED MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE, WHO CARES WHAT THE PRICE IS? JUST HOLD  - HFs WANT US TO PANIC. THEY WANT US TO SELL. IF YOU INVESTED MONEY YOU CAN LOSE, WHY WOULD YOU SELL?  TL;DR: IGNORE THE FUD ON THIS SUB. DON‚ÄôT SELL. HOLD THE LINE AND WATCH THEM ADD MORE FUEL TO THE ROCKET.   SHORT INTEREST ALREADY APPEARS TO BE BACK ABOVE 200% AT THIS PRICE. IF WE HOLD GME AT $100, THOSE OPTIONS ARE GONNA GET SQUEEZED TOO.
Weaklings among us
Do you know what I think about when I see weak ass paper hands little shitters talking about, ‚Äúoh no, Robinhood really wasn‚Äôt at fault here, it was just liquidity‚Äù, ‚Äúhedge funds aren‚Äôt stupid , they could have covered multiple times over all that volume‚Äù ‚Äúthere is no conspiracy‚Äù etc etc ...?  When I hear that, I think of the people who defended the Catholic Church over child abuse scandals, those who bought into pharmaceutical company propaganda, and those who defends some prominent politicians whom I shall not name over certain things. In general, brainless twats.  Where there is motive for profit or the prevention of loss thereof, there is action. I don‚Äôt know what RH did behind the doors, but I know they are motivated to do what they did. I don‚Äôt know what tactics HFs have or have not used, but I know they are motivated. SEC fuckers are also motivated bc they always have been.  So I am gonna believe that RH and vlad tenev and the hedge funds conspired to bring down GME, I am gonna believe that SEC and yellen are getting their big paydays by Wall street.  Just because I can‚Äôt pinpoint a specific evidence doesn‚Äôt mean that jack shit. Our courts have put people away for less.  My beliefs may not be exactly true, but they are certainly closer to truth than believing that RH HFs SEC and interested parties didn‚Äôt do anything illegal just because there is yet concrete evidence.  So hold those fucking GME shares, because I know those fuckers want them so bad that they will do anything to take it off your hands.  Get some post nut clarity to help your FUD brains.  Diamond fucking hands.
GME by the numbers
So take this information with a dump truck full of salt.  I hold GME so I do have a bias. I plan on selling my amc positions and getting more gme. This is not financial advice and I am  not professional.  Just a fellow ape mfr who likes the stock.   I want to give credit to dookiedimez on twitch.  This is his information that I'm parroting from him.  He has access to CapitalQ.   There's 69 and some change total available shares.  77 million are owned by institutions. Citadel owns approximately 111,000 shares. Ryan Cohen and 2 other individuals own another 20 million.  I never got around to seeing numbers for us ape ass mfr's. Buying has been happening far more than selling.  It also shows the price spike was due to covering some of the shorts. Approximately 13 percent of the shorts were covered.   There is still 68 million shares shorted.  I plan on going to his stream later today where hopefully he gets permission to show the information in real-time and in action.  Just not screenahots.   Hold on to yours and I'm going to be diamond handing. Sorry I don't know how to make rockets or emjois here.
Remember when this sub wasn‚Äôt solely a GME circlejerk?
I can‚Äôt wait to see all the loss porn from you dumbasses sucking each other off about holding a shit tier meme past its prime. GME is never hitting 1k, let alone 10k. Get your head out of your ass or get fucked.
The momentum is here today and they are likely scared. It‚Äôs important to keep the momentum even if they play offensive.
As the title says. The momentum for GME and AMC is here today. I can feel so much more optimism than yesterday. It‚Äôs important to keep it going even if they pull more BS.   GME 29@ 300 AMC 40 @15  Let‚Äôs gooo!!   Incase SEC has bots looking for emojis: Rocket rocket brrrr brrrr diamond hands.
Next AMC Shorts list
Does anybody know how much we have to stay above today to get more shares added for the hedge funds to buy back? It‚Äôs something like 1 billion shares now (or 1B dollars) so I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has a list?
What would happen if this community started buying a currency. For example Chinese Yuan. Would that even affect such a large asset as yuan is?
It seems to be hurting China if that happens.
Question about account transfer that Fidelity can‚Äôt answer
What‚Äôs up, smooth brains! So I just recently transferred my RH account to Fidelity and it got pretty fucked. They sent stocks that I no longer had a position in and didn‚Äôt transfer a few stocks that I did. This has created a deficit on my deactivated RH account due to negative shares that I no longer owned. Could anyone help with this cause I‚Äôm not sure how to fix it. Also GME
I don‚Äôt know anything about stock but all I know is don‚Äôt you dare sell anything
You can‚Äôt imagine the amount of ads telling me to ‚Äúsell before it‚Äôs late‚Äù or how redditors switched and left GME for other shit. This proves desperate times for them which means you‚Äôre all headed on the right track. Goodluck to everyone who‚Äôs holding and stay strong, you‚Äôre destroying them hard, and don‚Äôt forget to      .

Wanted to Help
I don‚Äôt have a lot of capital I can buy with but I bought AMC and GME this morning and am ready for the moon, boys!  I just wanted to help burn these fucking hedge funds to the ground in what little way I could.   üèª
I convinced my boss to buy the $GME dip.
He's a huge numbers guy and said the stock was tanking. I told him the price doesn't matter. WE BUY THE DIP, WE HOLD.  I hope I don't get my retarded ass fired.
Note of support
I just want you to know, there are many normal peasants who support what you have done.  Many people whom I have talked to think your move was bold and are happy its breaking the bank, so to speak.  The absence of the story is the media shows just how deep you have gouged the ruling class.
Is there an app I can trade futures on?
As title says. I currently use WeBull, and they have futures listed, but I can't seem to see anywhere where they offer to trade it. Are there any apps that do? When searching this, myself, I can only find websites that trade it.  Edit: I should specify, I'm looking for more of Index futures

Sandstorm was a standard ringtone on Nokia phones at that same time 4. Elon loves NOK 5. NOK to the moon     This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor, this is for the memes!
Let‚Äôs Get Real Here
We‚Äôre all retards, but we‚Äôre self-aware retards. We make our own decisions because A is A, B is B and GME is  .   Just because someone hypes up a stock doesn‚Äôt mean that you should invest. It‚Äôs always up to   YOU   and the amount of time you‚Äôre willing to spend   RESEARCHING   the stock. I know that‚Äôs not what WSB initially stood for, most of us just came here for the loss / gain porn. But now that the attention of SEC, media and hedge funds has been drawn onto us, it‚Äôs important to differentiate hype and rational, critical thinking.   None of us here buys stocks because   SOMEONE   tells us to do so. We make our own fucking choices and we accept the losses and welcome the gains.   Regarding the current situation: based on informative posts and comments I‚Äôve had the pleasure of reading, it looks like it‚Äôs going to be a long and weary battle. But at the end of the day, what differentiates you from a paper handed bitch and a legitimate retard, are the reasons behind your investing decisions.      Do you really believe that GME is an undervalued company (in general)? Do you believe that GME has the potential to expand into something truly beautiful and magnificent, especially after all the traction the company‚Äôs been having over the course of last month? Do you trust the company?      If you do, then you‚Äôve got nothing to worry about - even if the stock price dips to $50-60. Investing‚Äôs never about making a quick buck, sure there are those who get lucky every now and then, but if you invest with the ‚ÄúI make quick gains‚Äù mindset, chances are you‚Äôll lose. Because you‚Äôre investing in a highly volatile, unpredictable market that has a history of crashing at the slightest of inconveniences.   TDLR; invest in shit you actually believe in.

When / Where can I find the next GME Short Count
Need some help Gorilla gang   I don't know what the fuck is going on anymore.  I just can't bring myself to believe shorts are all (or even mostly) covered.       When does the short percentage of GME get posted    What's the source  POS 50@\~$126                   PS: Does anyone have a compiled DD of the last two weeks - shits got crazy af.  Not financial advice.
Even Ray Charles could see the ladder attacks and misinformation on $GME
I may be highly autistic but hold the line, retards. There is no way the shorts covered down to 39% percent (like I have seen in some articles) with the volume being sold. You would have seen a spike in price and a high number of longs selling. The numbers dont add up.  You only lose when you give up.   More reports are coming, and then we send $GME to the fuckin' moon!     Not financial advice. I have dozens of extra chromosomes.
RH to Fidelity... Account closed
For those of you that made the transfer from RH to Fidelity, did your fractional shares transfer? Did RH close your account? RH closed my account with about 2k left in fractional shares.  Edit: my GME stake was already in Fidelity IRA so didn't have any GME in RH. Wondering what's gonna happen for some of you that transferred everything except GME.
3 days?! Are you for real?!
Ok first off, it's been 3 whole fucking days, you fucking retards. Secondly, it hasn't even been 3 whole fucking days, you fucking retards! Tuesday closed at 90. Wednesday closed at   Even if you eat crayons and can't read, you'd have to be dumber than the dumbest fuck who ever fucked your wife to think that   is less than 90.      3 fucking days. And not even. That's all it took for the hedgies to beat you into submission, you weak-ass paper-handed bitch. And they knew it, too. They're laughing all the way to $5 knowing everyone will lose interest. I'm sure they weren't even expecting 3 fuckkng days. I'm sure they were at least expecting us to last a week.      So STFU and hold your fucking shares. It's that fucking easy. Turn off your phone, block access to your brokerage, whatever the fuck, just hold.      140 shares and buying more at open. Holding like my wife's boyfriend holds her sweet ass. So that one day I can be her boyfriend too.  TL;DR: you're a fucking pussy. Hold your shares and buy the dip.      ETA: I love this fucking stonk. That's the only reason I'm buying more and holding. Not financial advice. I am retard.
Bought 28 @ 293 $,
if I can sell for 1000$ I'm getting a GME tattoo. Anyone else as stupid as I am?
think I'm gonna buy some GME shorts. maybe some puts. come at me apes ‚úì‚úì‚úì
I'm also a retard.. gonna open up a fidelity but how do I actually buy shorts?
GME is no longer just a stock, try and forget about the money, it's the price we pay for CHANGE.
My fellow retardapes,   I'm no expert, nor am I even a pert. But, there is one thing I know, whatever happens - no matter what shade of red your portfolio shows (mine is currently a beautiful crimson) the movement isn't over. I bought at $348 - I have one share, I'm a tard - but, the red doesn't scare me. The thought of waking up in a few days, weeks - heck even months and looking on my phone and seeing the damage that we'll inevitably cause if the holding continues, that drives me. Fair enough, I only have one share - but, that one share means a hell of a lot more to me than money; it's a historic token, something I can show my grandchildren in 50 years (because I'm never going to sell) and also the first stock my ape hands has touched.   I don't really know what I'm writing at this point, so I'll wrap it up. Sit tight and remember, some dude probably has a darker shade of red than you.      TL;DR: Hold, I think?   (PS: I'm just a retard, on an echo-chamber high - this isn't financial advice blah blah blah, the stock is just super-duper awesome)
Could someone explain the dip happening and prediction of what‚Äôs to come?
Husband and I are the in it for the long run. We‚Äôre not backing down but I‚Äôm just a bit confused. If this is just like any other stock that might explode, then why are the SEC acting like we shoved a bunch of crayons up their ass?

Low-quality DD with thoughts about situation, future, exit and my impression of the whole "war"
This text will be emoji free, I won't tell everyone to hold to moon and shit, even though this might be the way... or not.     # I. current Situation  As all people here obviously noted, there is a war going on between hedge funds, retail investors and other people in the background including media, reddit, celebrities.  Everyone has their play, everyone wants money, fame, leverage, whatever.  There is a split here in reddit, some just want gainz, some want to keep the "movement" going, and some kinda want both.       FYI I'm neither.   I'm not invested in GME or anything else, as a matter of fact, I'm a stock virgin. I'm a pretty high earning, not 1% high, but I get a fucking good salary for my age and this will only rise. So I'm not in financial danger in any way, but I have close relationship to my money in terms of not losing it.  I wanted to buy GME, but at any given point except last wednesday I was looking at dangerous numbers either too volatile for me to get in or going down.     # II. what we REALLY know  We know: hedge funds shorted GME and others. We dont know from where exactly, we dont know exactly when, and as a matter of fact, we dont know how much. ALL the data we have is either outdated, not a good source or just flat wrong. SI might sit at 200% right now, that would tell us nothing. Those could be shorts started at 300 and hedges want to earn even more, those could be shorts started at 20, 90 or 180$.     At this moment,   even SI is not helping us making decision  s, even if we would know the true number.  We know the stock is very   volatile   right now, we dont really know why. Short ladder attacks are a myth, I hope this is cleared by now.     What is   obvious  , is that there is market "  manipulation  ". Manipulation derives from latin "manus", meaning by hand. That is for sure. We know hedge funds and even us change the stock price by hand somehow. If it is by buying, holding, selling, shorting, fake news, true news, whatever.     # III. What does that all mean now  It means, the short squeeze could already be over, it could mean we are in it, but it was heavily fought against by any means including unfair ones. It could mean squeeze is still in the future waiting.     What it means for the stock: It will stay volatile. It might stay at 90$ for some time, as long as retailes still buy in, and maybe even other hedge funds or whales. It might drop, it might even rise,   maybe hedge funds bought in right now and want to keep the momentum upward and sell at a specific point, crushing the price with retailers beeing the bagholders.    What does it mean for us retailers?  Its dangerous to invest into this stock. Nothing is safe, diamond handing this could end in GME dropping to 20$ again and this might stay the case for a long time. It might work and stock price goes into 1000$.     # IV. Whom are we fighting?  It is important to note, that we are fighting a multibillion dollar cartel of people who are deep into the stockmarket since beginning of stock trading. Basically, they know every trick and more. Do you guys really think, they have no idea how to fight retailers? They might do "ladder attacks" because they shorted the stock again and now stop, just to buy into GME? They might want us all to hold just so the price rises until EXACTLY 299$ when they will sell 10mm shares and price drops to 90$ again.  They might want to ride the rocket to the moon, too. They might want the whole stock to drop to 10$, who knows.     It is important to know, that they analyse this whole sitation and make their own plan.     # V. What is the danger here?     This is a reddit. We are 8,5mm degenerates on this sub and latest after last week hedge funds are monitoring this. So what is the problem? If reddit is monitored, they might even use this, for example,   they know a ton of people will cling to this stock with their life, not even thinking about selling if it is 98% down  . I have no fucking clue what a good trader could do with this info, but I'm betting it is dangerous for the people on here invested in GME.     # VI. What shall we do, what is the future?     I have no fucking clue. Personally, if I already had invested in GME, there would be 2 possible situations:  I got in below todays market price. For example like all those guys with 10k shares at 20$. They are still hugely in the green. I personally would propably have secured some cash at 400$, but I would definitly secure some cash now, depending how much I'm in. I would keep at least a good portion of the stock in hopes in goes moon.     If I got in above todays market price, let's say at 150, I would think about getting out anytime the stocks goes above 100$ again and try to minimise my loss, IF the money is a lot for me or I need it.     If it is gamble money, I would stay invested, but would be pessimistic enough to not hope for rocketfuel.  # VII. What if the rocket goes moon, when do I sell  A false impression that was created here is that everyone, at any point buying into GME would make tons of tendies. That is WRONG. Usually, in situations like this, early adopters make tons of tendies (DFV for example or anyone who got in at 20$ dollar range). Then at some point, let's say stock price hits 1000$. Now what happens if everyone and their mother sells at exactly that point? First 10000 sellers get their 1000$ price. But pretty fast, price drops immensly. This will end in a downward spiral (see VW short squeeze graph). With tons of people not making huge bank or even lose money, IF they got in late. (think 300$ range and sell the last)     So what could be an exit strat be?    I would say, the later you got in, the earlier you sell.    That makes sure you exit in the GREEN, and not accidentally in the red. I wont sell at 350 if I got in at 300. But I wouldnt wait out a mass selloff and then might drop under 200$ and still lose money after I tripled my money.       Last words from a stock virgin and TLDR:   This whole story is crazy and cool, and   I hope all of ya earn tons of tendies  . But PLS for the love of god, IF stock raises again and you see overall black numbers, and this is your fucking   retirement money  , GET IT FUCKING BACK and cash out. This is not a game.  This whole dream of becoming a rich tendie ape is not worth beeing homeless because stocks treat retailers like bitches. This whole thing might work out. But you're against a multibillion dollar cartel that does EVERYTHING to make money or keep money. They shit on every rule, just to stay on top. Dont risk your life's savings on the hunch they might play by the book.
A Valiant Effort
What we are doing here is historical, don¬¥t doubt for a moment how big of a deal this is in stock market history. This event has been like the Plato¬¥s Cave of finances and now that we know what we can do and how easily we can do it, this will happen again and again (unless they alter the system to prevent it). Although we fight for a good cause with valiant effort, do not attack and belittle the people who decided to sell, you don¬¥t know what these \`\`paper hands¬¥¬¥ are going through and how much they could use the money. Calling them names makes you no better than the media.
We could seriously fuck over the hedgie bot that detects the most mentioned stocks here if we spam posts that mention a random stock we decide on an excessive amount of times.
Doubt the hedgie bot is sophisticated enough to know when it‚Äôs being manipulated.
NOK quarterly Report
It comes out today hedge funds like to short the hell out of NOK on this day every quarter!  Lets burn these MF's!
At market open, I'm selling...
My car to buy a bigly amount of Lambos with the tendies I'm going to get from GME    üåï  This is NOT financial advice, I'm just a retarded   talking shit on the internet  PS: Melvin =     PPS: Here's an "Excessive amount of Rocket emoji's"
Questions about GME
Hey guys,  I've been lurking in the sub for 1 year and participate in some trades that get quite popular in the sub, obviously one of them being GME. I currently hold 90 positions @ avg $80 and continuing to diamond hand this fuck out of this squeeze.  I'm a retard so i need a smarter retard to explain some shit to me :  1. At this moment, if everyone holds I do not see any possibility for us to lose this war since one day the hedgies will have to pay back the float since there is a   interest float and   of the shorts are outstanding according to Yahoo Finance so why has this suddenly become very risky for people? 2. Price doesn't matter if nobody sells, but if the hedges attempt Naked Shorts will the price matter? 3. Ideally this could go on forever since Hedges make millions if not billions in interest and can afford to keep attacking the price day by day and covering shorts as people begin to get bored or sell so how do we know a short squeeze will happen? 4. How can we lose?  Either way, I'm going to Diamond Hand this shit to fucking Pluto or go down fighting the corrupt dicks.
Remember why we started all of this.
Listen up retards. We knew what we signed up for when we bought into this stock. We knew that we would see the fattest dips on the way to the moon. We knew that this wasn't just about making a quick buck. It was about sending a message. Now I don't fucking care if I hit rock bottom on this god damn stock. I put what I was willing to lose and if that's what it takes then by god I'll do it. When the dust settles and the tendies are handed out, which side do you want to be on?  Do you want to be the ones who sat by and accepted the fact that we'd get fucked over by the big guy again. Or do you want to be the ones who raged on against the machine, to show that no, YOU CAN'T STEP OVER US. YOU CANT FUCKING TREAT US LIKE IDIOTS AND PULL THE SAME FUCKING SHIT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECT US TO BEND OVER AND TAKE IT LIKE MY WIFE DOES FROM HER BOYFRIEND.  Now you can call me an autistic motherfucker for holding on to this "useless" stock. But I have a dream. A dream where I can pay for my college fees. A dream where I can do the things that I want to do without having to worry about how much it's going to cost me. A dream where I can pursue a career I want without having to spread my asscheeks and take shit up my ass everyday. Isn't that what the American dream is about? (Disclaimer: Not American) Don't you remember the things you were going to do once you cashed out on the tendies of this stock? Pay off your student debt? Your loans? Remember that feeling.  I can't say what's going to happen today, tomorrow, let alone this month. But I sure as hell know that I'm holding. $GME FOREVER FUCK YOU HEDGE FUNDS  TLDR:
What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favourite number?
I think my lucky number is 15,000   I used to like 20,000 and 30,000 but I think they‚Äôre too high of numbers, not sure though. I can barely understand the base 10 number system, you see.    What‚Äôs your favourite number?
Janet Yellen is so clearly transparent in the GMA interview. She's nervous, anxiously trying to avoid saying anything about Gamestop and absolutely avoiding calling attention to the hedge funds.
When individuals in power act that skiddish and anxious, we need to look further and ask for serious change. Our leaders need to be strong in their convictions and not bend over backwards because a hedge fund paid them money. We need to have every government position be akin to community service and cycle random (qualified) citizens into the role for a limited amount of time (2-4 years). These positions corrupt damn near everyone given enough time. The only way to stop that cycle is to take away the opportunity and simply make it random like jury duty.
Lets see if I can post on my cake day about GME
I‚Äôd like to give words of encouragement to all my ape brethren and sisters (gotta be inclusive cause that article called us sexists).  I‚Äôve seen so many uplifting stories over these past two weeks, I got in a little late avg 170 for 4 shares.  But last week that dude talked about feeling alive since his wife‚Äôs passing, another guy talked about experiencing homelessness, people have bought switches for kids in hospitals and donated to charity.    This isn‚Äôt a meme anymore, together we are helping to make better lives for one another.  We have found a common purpose in GME and I feel like that is one of the main goals for every ape in their life.  I‚Äôm still holding and I don‚Äôt care if I lose all my fucking money but after reading countless discussion threads and DD I truthfully believe we‚Äôre going to the moon so long as we stick TOGETHER.  I‚Äôve tried to explain to my friends who aren‚Äôt involved in our struggle about what‚Äôs going on here and they just can‚Äôt comprehend it that a bunch of people on the internet care about one another to the point of facing potential financial loss.  I trust you guys (and girls) and know that you trust me too. That‚Äôs what I think makes this so special.  Thank you all for the laughs and the ups and downs and the joyous feeling of smashing in all caps on the keyboard about being an AUTIST.   üèº are forever and I will stay with you all till the moon.  tl;dr I love you all and IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING TOGETHER STRONG                üåõ
Our state Reps actually do have our interests at heart regarding the HF evildoers. Here's a response from mine. We can make change.
So I decided to put down my banana and sign a message for my handler to deliver to my state Rep. Didn't expect to have a response, but just got this in. This has been suggested before here, so be like Koko, don't throw shit, relay your concerns like the cultured apes we are.  "Thank you for writing to me with your concerns regarding the trading of stocks like GME and AMC. Your thoughts on these important matters are most welcome and appreciated.  As you mentioned, after an unexpected surge in gains for stocks such as GME, certain financial services institutions and trading platforms suspended the trading of this and other stocks on January 28, 2020. These trading restrictions have since raised questions regarding the legality of barring smaller, retail investors from participating in stock trading during periods of volatility. Like you, I have serious concerns about brokerage platforms putting in place restrictions, which limit the free trading of stocks and options, especially when those restrictions disproportionately benefit large hedge fund operators at the expense of individual investors.  In recent years, online brokerage platforms have made the stock market more accessible to individual retail investors. While this progress is important in allowing everyday Americans the freedom to make their own investment decisions, it's important that these platforms allow their users to participate on an equal playing field with the large banks, funds, and institutional investors that have dominated the stock market for decades.  You may be interested to know that I am a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. Given that this subcommittee is responsible for funding the operations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), I have a unique opportunity to engage with this agency on recent market volatility. In the coming weeks, I look forward to the opportunity to question the SEC Chair on the handling of this situation and will keep your concerns in mind as I have those discussions. The SEC must help provide answers to the thousands of retail investors who may have been harmed by the surprise restrictions put in place on January 28th. "  Edit: Whether this Rep will really take this and run with it remains to be seen, however like I've been told more than once in my life...."You don't get if you don't ask".
This isn‚Äôt a gamble. This is a war!
Okay guys, I know you are scared. I know that it‚Äôs hard to not be able to see the future. But always remember why you started. What was your motivation for holding that long?  Was it money? If yes, did you get what you wanted? If you didn‚Äôt get what you wanted, then hold till you get it.  Was it to change something in your own life? If yes, did something change? If you didn‚Äôt get what you wanted, then hold till you get it.  Was it to change the world and give yourself and other people the opportunity to live a better life? If yes, did you achieve your dreams? If you didn‚Äôt, then hold until you got what you deserve.   Here is my reason: I am and I always was a person who wanted to change something. I can‚Äôt stand seeing people starve. I can‚Äôt stand seeing people die because they can‚Äôt pay their medicine. I can‚Äôt stand seeing people overwork themselves until they are depressed and can‚Äôt feel happy anymore. I want all of you to be happy. In my humble opinion the whole system is corrupt and designed to favor the ones on top and to keep the others busy down here. I started to learn about investment back in my teenage years, because I knew I wanted to get out of this hole and to take as many people as I could with me.  Now, thanks to DFV we have the chance to change something big. We have seen billionaires cry, we have seen them throw a tantrum, we have seen market manipulation, we have seen the media be with us and then turn against us. We have big names like Mark Cuban (who said he would also hold, if he had some stocks) on our side whom gives us advice and defends us live on TV. Even only that billionaires are crying, accusing us and that many brokers restrict us from buying should be enough evidence that we‚Äòre onto something big! They‚Äôre defending ‚Äûtheir‚Äú wealth with everything they can. They play dirty and they have power, but we‚Äòve got strength in numbers. If you hold, then I‚Äòll hold, then he will hold, then she will hold. We are in this together and if we want to succeed, we get to succeed. The only question is, how bad do you want it?  What‚Äôs the reason you got invested?   This is not a financial advice, since advices aren‚Äôt something anyone can generalize. Advice depends always on your personal situation and motives
Reddit did NOT invent short ladder attacks
Recently, I've seen a lot of FUD and claims that WSB retards "invented" short ladder attacks. I'm not a financial professional, so I cannot say with certainty that such attacks are possible in practice, but what I  can  say is that they were in fact described by others well before the GME thing. I'd like to believe that the individuals claiming it's a WSB meme are just ignorant, but it may be just another attempt to manipulate WSB. So let's set the record straight.  This blog post from 2008 describes a "short down ladder" attack used by shorting hedge funds:   This Seeking Alpha post from 2014 describing flooding the order books with counterfeit shares:   This public comment on the SEC site from 2008 about how counterfeit shares were used to manipulate the price of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:   Thanks u/Professional_Fig7437 for mentioning that this practice was previously called "painting the tape."  This SEC article describes an incident where the price was driven up, not down.  >placing successive buy orders in small amounts at increasing prices  (painting the tape)      I vaguely remember another SEC document being posted here last week on the topic, but can't find it anymore. If anyone has a link to that or other documents, please PM or post in comments.  All of these documents roughly describe the same process of selling counterfeit shares back and forth to lower stock prices. Now, again, I cannot say for certain that such attacks are really possible. But I can say that they were  not  invented by reddit.  Now, I do not think the 100/200 share orders we've seen are proof of this. Nor do I think we've seen these attacks every day. However, I'm fairly certain we saw this attack specifically on the day RH blocked buying. The massive decrease in buy pressure would have allowed hedgies to freely trade back and forth without risking their shares being bought. RH blocking buys and ladder attacks combined probably caused the crash we saw that day.  And finally, back to GME short positions. For those wondering if Melvin has indeed covered their short position already, this article summarizes the possibility that they have bought synthetic longs from a MM (Citadel) instead:    DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional and this is not financial advice. Do your own research. I'm open to counterpoints, please post any information you have in the comments.  EDIT: Added painting tape link, section about when this attack probably occurred.
HOLDING & BUYING both GME & AMC
Genuinely believe in both & love the stocks. Don‚Äôt be getting paper hands, have some faith my fell apes! I know it‚Äôs been a wild retarded ride so far, many are probably feeling the pressure to sell because of the smooth brained reports on the ye old video box in the dusty corner of the room! Silver?! Hahaha SEC investigating this sub?! Hahaha!   APES STRONG TOGETHER! NOT THESE DINOSAUR HEDGES!   STRAP IN MY FELLOW RETARDS
To the moon or not - i will fly the damn rocket - holding GME
The haiku aside, i just bought GME after thinking to myself: Even if i lose all the money and the rocket crashes, i bought the tickets for the ride.  Who else can tell they flew with a rocket? So let's enjoy it no matter what
Automated Trading Software? Anyone have insight?
So I finally stumbled upon ShortAlgo. I am sure there are others, but I have not discovered them yet. I have been checking it out, it presents algorithm derived buy/sell signals and seemingly quite a bit more too.  It appears like it has  Trading for Dummies  built right into it.    Anyone have experience with it?    What's your take on it?   Is it worth the $69/mo subscription?   Are there better software options?  Let's hear it, please?

NOK - Earnings JUST came out - BUY BUY BUY
NOK beat expectations by like 50%.  Report came out not even hours ago. They were expected to ~~lose and  had huge gains~~  to show $  and instead showed $ , and  Worst case, at $5 you're not going to lose a terrible amount. Covid crash had it around $      Edit: Sorry, I misspoke when I said "loss/gain". I have corrected my original post and left the correction up for all to see. I did not intend to deceive anyone and regret that some feel I did.
Nothing matters at this point. Just hold and wait, you'll get your tendies soon
- News articles saying squeeze is over doesn't matter. It's fake - S3 short interest data doesn't matter. It's fake - All the naysayers are just paper handing bitches. Ignore them! - The price went down for 3 days in a row. It literally doesn't matter. The price could go to $1, it literally wouldn't matter. As long as we don't sell, they can't close their short positions. Hell even delisting GME wouldn't matter at this point. We would just hold. - Low volume doesn't matter. We've seen this before. Although high volume is usually an indicator that a squeeze is happening, in this case it's just Melvin fucking with us and playing psychological warfare.  They're trying to make it more and more difficult to hold and make us feel more and more stupid for not just giving in, but it's exactly what they want. Go for a walk if you can't look at the price of the stock. This is a new paradigm, it literally doesn't matter at this point because of the fundamentals.  Stay strong! You'll get your tendies soon. At this point we're like Jonestown, just financially rather than physically!  426 shares of GME bought at $ , not selling for less than $10k!
Are we doing AMC too?
I'm new to this. GME is a little salty for my tastes.  Are we gonna do AMC? What's the story there?  Edit: A few people think that my post means "are we going to pump and dump AMC". That's _not_ what I mean.  I know what's going on, I just can't afford to participate in the GME hold.
AGFY - indoor agriculture systems
A new IPO barely a week old, indoor Agrify indoor grow solution is a play on the cannabis market without getting into cannabis. With the legislature in the US finally coming around and cannabis becoming mainstream, this could be a good way to capitalize on the trend.  Current market cap is around 200M, so could be good for both long term investment, as well as for short term trading.

Being paperhanded cost be about 35k, and it could potentially cost you more
Back in november, I bought $GME 1/15/21 $30 calls. I made about $5k, and bought a 2/5 $33 gme call for $500. Yes. Five hundred dollars. I paperhanded out at about 3k, but if I had HELD, I would be about $35-40,000 richer. Let my mistakes be a lesson for you. I feel like GME is about to explode, so I'm Holding the line (and I hope everyone else will to, because fuck the hedges)
Not holding because I believe in AMC any more
I don't believe in AMC nor GME anymore to be honest, I'm only holding because I believe in WSB and all you beautiful retards. ‚ù§Ô∏è Came in @ 16 bought more @ 8, and ill hold that shit till the moon as long as you retards hold with me  üèº ü§öüèº Help me WSB, I need gains so I can buy my wife's boyfriend a new car
Buying a piece of the Berlin Wall
I posted this on another thread, but thought i should also post here. I wanted to buy into the Gaming stock to show solidarity with the young people who started this revolution. i had family members tell me that i would lose my money. I explained that i would never invest money into it in an attempt to make money. I compared it to buying a chunk of the Berlin Wall. If I did that, nobody would say, oh no, you paid too much money for that brick. To me, this movement is something to be a part of even in a very small way. So, only buy a chunk of this brick if you can afford it, and you are doing it to own a piece of history. do not count on making money from it.
GME short squeeze already happened right?
Why are y‚Äòall wasting your live savings on nothing. The stock won‚Äòt go up again.
While everyone else on here sells and makes a lot of money make sure you HOLD the GME stock to keep it high
That is what the suckers on here will do they will HOLD the GameStop stock until the stock they bought for $300 is back down to the $20 that it is really actually worth with no foreseeable future of it going anywhere near the losses the morons on here talked you all into.
For those looking to switch from RH
Any broker should be fine if you actually know what your doing. RH is visually pleasing but other broker apps have the same or more data for you to see. What you should look at is broker fees and shit.   I‚Äôm full spectrum, disregard me
America at its core is founded in the pursuit of happiness
If we cannot expect a better tomorrow for ourselves, for our families, for our community, than why go on living even one more day?  If this government takes away all ability for the hard-working common person to earn and enjoy its tendies today, and to enjoy even more tendies tomorrow... enough tendies for the whole family to be fat and satisfied...     this government takes that away from us, by instead protecting and ensuring institutional corruption and deception at every level of financial accessibility -- salaries, business ventures, real estate, stock markets, government bonds, the monetary supply -- we as the people of this nation cease to have meaning and purpose.  There must be fair avenues to allow the pursuit of happiness, which must include the opportunity to accumulate and grow wealth (as that is an essential element of the human-physical experience in our world today).
Should I invest in GME?

help invested 5k in $GME, now can't afford wife's boyfriend's birthday present.
Was planning on buying my wife's boyfriend a present as it's his birthday coming up. I got an advanced payment for the next month and a half of work and got a payday loan to put a downpayment on a new Ford Mustang for my wife's boyfriend. Hopped on Reddit and saw some kind strangers investing in $GME, I was hesitant at first but finally decided to buy in at $350. I'm down to about $1250, do I hold or sell? My wife's boyfriend won't be happy with me if I don't get him anything. Any help would be appreciated.

I keep hearing that failures to deliver can indicate counterfeit shares, are there any other scenarios that can explain FTD?
I'm curious and hoping anyone with more experience can weigh in and give some information.
They have something you don't have and they knew it
\ \ This is not financial advise just some monkey pressing some keyboard keys\ \   I'm an investor(ETF) since I turn 18 and active trader(Stonks) 3 years ago(not daily trader).  I see most of you need to learn what I learn in my short period of active trader,   fucking discipline and  be patient.     Most of newbies(myself also) when you start you look to the stonks every fucking time, stop, trace a strategy, do DD and make some math. Because one of the most, and I think remarcable fails, is when you try to catch momentum, when momentum is nearly over or will be flat during a long time, that is why people buy high and sell low, they are not stupid. They are like you and me, but they think as momentum goes the stonks will be flat or go higher.   WRONG    Most of the time when momentum stops stonks suffer from correction or be more flat than your wife tits for a long time. If you do a nice DD and conclude stonk is under value just invest and forget about been flat or stupid fluctuations, correct your strategy over time and   stick to your fucking plan  .   At this point if you made a correct prediction you will have gains, if don't you will lose. But either ways you will   Learn.   You can't learn a shit throwing yourself into the "NeXt BiG ThInG" it's okay to jump on trends but learn why are you fucking doing and avoid been a paper hand, buy high sell low.     TL;DR:  STOP BEEN A PUSSY, STICK TO YOUR STARTING DECISION, DON'T FOMO.     \ \ Positions\ \   500 Calls on NOK 5c 22'  45 shares of GME
What scenario's could cause the rocket to crash?
I'm new to the world of stocks, but since Monday I've put as much money into GME as I can afford ($480 currently with an additional $100 ready to go to buy the next dip)   But with so much misinformation circulating, I want to know what could actually cause GME  to plummet and the rocket never take off? (Other than half the sub turning into paper handed bitches of course)  I'm not worried  ü§ö forever, just curious about possible scenarios.   Also, im not a financial advisor, I just like the stock.  APE TOGETHER STRONG
Alright, guess I'm in!
I couldn't find my passport, so i asked my brother to buy one stock. We bought one at 300, and split it. Then it fell to 90, and I asked him to buy again... Only this time he bought 20.  So i got myself 10,5 GME stock, and I'm diamond hands on this bitch! To the moon!
All of you holding GME are living in an echo chamber. The squeeze already happened.
If you think a stock going from 4 to 400, a 100x return, is not a short squeeze, idk what is my guy. Sell your GME if you need the money because that shit isn't coming back. I like GME and I'll start buying it when it comes back down to like 20 or 10 but there is zero reason to hold rn.   Retail traders only hold like 17% of the company or less. Companies like Vanguard held like 40% of GME(usually wrapped in etfs)  and what happened is they sold that shit because it was too volatile for their portfolios. 40% selloff is a lot bigger than 17% selloff and the hedge funds got out somewhere in there or slightly before.   Also all of you shilling gamestop are a cancer to this sub, I just want to hear DD about companies to bet on, not the same fucking company over and over for a month.
What if many   would go in together on a group of stocks.
My question is what would happen if alot of people from WSB would buy the same stocks on the same day. Would it trigger a massive profit taking since the stocks would prob spike or would it actually make the stock go up more over a longer time period? I dont know shit about stocks i just buy them and hold.

These goons want to take away online freedom
The wording on this is kind of shocking. It makes it sound like individuals will be held accountable for GME...... \ Feds kick down door\  so mr u/poonlicker69420 we heard you like large scale market manipulation and causing hedge funds to go bankrupt. We are going to be investigating your activity on this highly coordinated attack centralized on the forum WSB and if we find that you lied about this stonk going to the moon you may face criminal charges.
Which companies are Wall Street scumbags shorting the most, you ask? FuckTheSuits is LIVE with the answer!

One GME share is better than none. The Lilliputians can keep the giant down!
I've been lurking for about ten days.  I don't have a lot of money to play with so I bought one share yesterday.  If every lurker on this board bought just one share, the force of that would probably be pretty significant.  Don't you guys agree?
Closing RH accounts?
Disclaimer: I myself is not a RH user, but amongst all the discussions, I'm curious why there hasn't been a movement for all RH users to close their accounts and move to a different broker?    If the same effort gone to buying and holding is gone to transiting their accounts away from RH, I'm guessing that will have some significant impact to RH.
Reuters is spreading FUD.
# Reuters is like the broke version of Bloomberg.  That the opinion of an ex-bloomberg employee (also, fuck Bloomberg while I'm at it.)  # I use StreetSmart Edge from Charles Schwab.  Over the past hew days, I've been watching the incoming headlines in my news feed on SSE and they are just ridiculous.  Im not sure if they are doing it for the clicks or FUD, but most of it is blatantly false if anyone took a moment to check the WSB page.  They could just be aggregating news from other sources and spitting them back out at us.  Either way they need to do some DD, cause its asinine.   # Latest one I've seen is "Reddit trading frenzy stalls as focus turns to Yellen meeting".  I cant help but sit there and giggle when I see this as well as get a bit nauseous at the same time that people have the galls to do things like this.     I am not a financial advisor.  I am an Ape with diamond hands and I like bananas.  Also, fuck you SEC.
They can‚Äôt make us lose money, HOLD THE LINE  ü§≤
No matter how low the share price of GME goes you literally don‚Äôt lose money until you sell at this manipulated low price, hold your shares until they‚Äôre forced to buy at whatever price you choose.  They need our shares, we don‚Äôt need their money.  Hold hold hold, diamond hands diamond hands diamond hands, yada yada yada.  This is not financial advice, I‚Äôm a retarded ape with diamond hands.  I like the stock.
So let me try and understand this SEC investigation and how it is not just a MASSIVE waste taxpayer money and resources.
People took public information about a hedge fund shorting a publicly traded   attempts to hypothetically bankrupt them and profit from it from destroying all they ever worked for.  Then talked about this public information on a social media platform, because you know that is what you do on social   and share ideas. So people got more excited about a stock they were already invested in and bought more.   Then more people said hey this looks like a good stock and I can see how their recent publicly announced hiring decisions and moves could benefit me in the future, because you know I am a gamer and love their products. Plus with the strengthening of the recently suppressed economy, this company could really blow up.  So armed with this all this public info, more people decided to invest.   Then some already known and convicted insider trader lost 53% of his investors money and had to be bailed out by the company that hired an SEC employee to speak publicly at their events.  Now all of the sudden, this same speaker is calling for an SEC investigation into the sharing of public information on social media.  Am I getting this right?
$GME Canadian Equivalent
Is there rumblings of a Canadian GME/AMC equivalent? I'm not trying to stir a pot, but thought something may be brewing. Thank you!
Where else is there ????
For us new guys that are now interested in getting in the game and , where can we go since RH has taken a crap on the people? (And by game I'm not talking about casually diving in. I'm talking about holding the line but doing it smart and not just following the masses because it's something "fun" to do...respectfully) thanks!

One question : When are we going to the moon?
I love what we have set out to do to stick it to the big corpies. I just can't wait to celebrate with y'all retards that's all!  Edit 1: i get approved account. I buy. I hold.
The GME 100 strike this Friday, open interest and max pain. Does this mean anything?

Is it possible to have physical stock certificates issued for GME?
Question is in the title. [I haven't] actually requested a physical certificate before for any   it even possible today (and with GameStop in particular)?
This is how conspiracy theorists develop
The last weeks have been interesting. This sub has become a huge filter bubble where opposing views aren't welcome anymore. People posting them are "Bots" or "Shills". Or are they? Maybe they are just regular people whose view you don't want to hear. People have started to cling onto any piece of information that supports their view and gives them hope that the journey to the moon is not over. Other informations are disregarded as fake news, even if they could be true. You notice a pattern? This is exactly how conspiracy theorists behave. We're witnessing thousands of conspiracy theorists come into being right in this sub.
Daily discussion for Thursday February 4th
Automod must be hung over today.  GME thread:    Read the rules, don‚Äôt be too much of a dick, etc etc.
GTFO with your pessimism and trash talking profit takers...
I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts the last few days trashing people who took gains and got back in. Any advice or comments they make get downvoted and scorned. Anyone who jumped on the bandwagon to ‚Äúget rich‚Äù without understanding the risks and potential downside only have themselves to blame for their losses.  There are those of us who are here on principle to take a stand and make a show of force to the larger forces who manipulate the market, and your money and lives, every day without you knowing. There are those of us who are here because we like to gamble a bit and understand that you don‚Äôt walk into the casino with money you aren‚Äôt willing to lose. We know that this is a gamed system and the odds can change in the blink of an eye. We play anyway, because we can and will take the hit and learn from it for the next round.  Don‚Äôt trash talk people who took profit just because they knew when to get out and get back in. Learn from it/them, and do your own   stay out of the pool and tell stories to your grandkids about the time you  almost  invested and took a chance at making money, or stood up to corporate evil. Fuck outta here with all that other nonsense.
THERE ARE NO PAPER HANDS ON THIS SUB. SHUT THE F    UP!
Literally not a single WSB member is talking about selling.  Every single legitimate post I see is about people saying to hold the line, saying they bought more at a discount, diamond hands, etc. No one, let me repeat, absolutely no one on this sub is talking about how they are selling.  All those posts accusing people of having paper hands and telling people to stop selling are meant to trick you into thinking other people are selling. Let me repeat. Not a single member of this sub has been posting about selling. There are literally zero posts that mention selling.  Anyone saying people on WSB are selling is trying to sow doubt nto your heart and make you think there is a sell-off. No such thing is happening. We are all still holfing. Keep those beautiful diamond hands and downvote those Melvin interns making shit up. Maybe your wife will even let you have a turn when her boyfriend gets tired.  And remember:  + =üí™üèø
REMINDER: DONT FKING INVEST WHAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO LOSE
Dont be dilusional. I know we are autistic and all, but if your wife's boyfriend finds out you lost all his money you could seriously lose your home.  If something looks too good to be true, it probaply is  That said  BUY THE FUCKING DIP
Whatever 11D chess is occurring right now... Just. Yeah this should play out
My sus meter is going through the roof here. Way I see it, if you already are down, whats the point selling at this point for the piddly amount left. OTOH if this is some complex BS ruse to scare people, and it shoots up, do you really want to have that regret?  I felt this heated moment needed a human chaotic fucking piece of input. Delete it I guess IDK. I dont have any idea what the right move is. All I do know, is people suck, and well. Im goin the Costanza route. Down with the ship because I put money into a stock I like, assuming it would go to hell. So it shall be  Fuck moons, fuck BS cliches we've heard a bazillion times. Let this shit play out IMO. All im sayin
Are we giving up on $BB or what?
Still holding 909 shares. Only see posts pushing for GME and AMC. Are my fellow $BB gang still holding or is our rally meeting it's end?
Does everyone know what time it is? Sub drama time!
Degenerate Gamblers,  Recently, there‚Äôs been a split within the moderation team. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt end amicably. There are a group of us that want to push the subreddit forward and allow it to grow organically, while another group was afraid of the change that was coming and wanted to put restrictions in place to curtail that growth.  The OG mods are still here. In fact, we‚Äôve been here every day, for hours on end working hard to help this community stay afloat and accommodate the influx of new users. There is no hedge fund attack, no grand conspiracy, just some run of the mill subreddit drama.  So let‚Äôs talk about that in a bit more detail.  The OG mods want this place to be run by the community and to grow as the community sees fit. Other mods that we placed our trust in disagree with this approach. Certain mods want to grow a personal following in their own name and act for themselves rather than acting as just one of the many wallstreetbets mods who are here to serve the community. Certain mods want to make this place political.  We tried to discuss this difference in approach and work through the issues. Some of the other mods weren‚Äôt interested in talking and chose the nuclear option. They chose to spread misinformation on the sub and in the daily threads. They chose to create stickies on the front page and in every thread.   We had to take action to prevent this attempt to fracture the community, which resulted in some mods losing their privileges.  We didn‚Äôt take this action lightly. We know we may have hurt some feelings by doing this. But we simply refuse to stand by and watch this place be burnt to the ground.   We were planning on waiting to announce this once we had everything lined up, but yes we have been approached by producers regarding a potential movie and many of the other mods were a part of those conversations, including /u/zjz. What wasn‚Äôt shared though, was that we are planning to donate any proceeds from this (if any!) to charity. Claiming this as evidence that we are attempting to ‚Äúmonetize the sub‚Äù is extremely dishonest.  We are here to protect the sub from manipulation. And we will continue to do just that, even if that manipulation comes from within and from people we once trusted.
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable
Remember, the SEC are watching us, so you MUST  write "this is not financial advice" every time you post financial advice.     This is not legal advice.
It's only a loss if you sell
You can have a nice green chart or a chart that resembles a summoning ritual for the blood God. But it is only potential. You can't buy coffee with your stock so at that moment it is money that you are can't touch anyway. The moment you sell you get more or less money than you put in  Those are your profit Those are your loses  Every second you hold you are along for the ride in this glorious rollercoaster.  But please stop crying about red charts, you only lose the money if you sell
Digital Pre-Owned Copies?
What if there was some kind of e-commerce website that I could use to buy/sell/trade my "used" digital copies of my PC games? I could only imagine this happening if some previously successful e-commerce guru were in charge of a company that looked like they would be in a great position to do so. Just my two cents.     EDIT: I don't know shit about laws and stuff. I just felt like I had a really good idea that fits my own personal narrative, so I wanted to share it. Is that ok with everyone? I've been a long time lurker on here, and I got some tendies already so I'm just thinking about some stuff. My DD is limited to my thoughts and prayers, which I think we all need a lot of right about now.     Thesis: IF THERE WAS A WAY I COULD TRADE MY VIDEOGAMES LIKE I USED TO BE ABLE TO TRADE STONKS ON ROBINHOOD, I'D NEVER HAVE TO BUY A VIDEOGAME AGAIN.
Let's talk about the B-Book, why brokerages locked out certain stocks.
I never hear people in here talk about the B-Book. Not all your orders actually execute to market, the organisation with the trade order can choose what to do with it. 1) send it to market so if you win the guy on the other end gets fucked or 2) internalise the trade and if you win they get fucked. The opposite of number 2 is you lose and they take your stack, all 100% of it.  The reality is 60-80% of options trades lose CFD trades are about 60% losing. Shares trades I have no fucking idea but probably more than 50% lose.  Why is this a problem? Because last / this week the guys internalizing the trades got fucking rodgered, their loss porn would have made post on here look like fucking lunch money in 1982.   The decision to block trading certain instruments was 100% to protect the market makers, artificial market makers not the market. This might not have happened with Robin hood but you can bet your ass the pricks sucking their dick for order flow would have and this is how you end up with commission free trading.  The commission covers the trade execution at market and has some cream for everyone down the line, but the greedy pricks running this circus figured out "why take the cream why you can just suck the milk outta the cow titty?".   With GME and AMC these quant betas realised the team at WSB was gonna be the 'wifes boyfriend' this time, so they fucking slashed your tyres before you could get in to smash!  Tldr: most retail orders never make it to market. Brokerages etc run the numbers and take on that risk, but they never expect it to get risky.
Why you should buy Blockbuster
Lol buy Blockbuster hedge funds are watching buy Blockbuster and their algorithms buy Blockbuster are trying to see buy Blockbuster what stock buy Blockbuster is being talked about most buy Blockbuster here.   This is not financial advice.  4 shares @ GME @ 260, 150.
Don‚Äôt make big buys of $GME... make many small buys of $GME. Inverse the latter attacks!    üåï
Also hold everything.  Made purchases as 20, 235, 190, 90 and will keep making purchases until this bitch reaches 100,000.  The math fundamentals are in our favor, now comes the pain for these illegal hedge funds  Edit: I‚Äôm still drunk and this is not financial advice and I don‚Äôt own a ladder and I rode the short bus to school
The GME victory is for ninjas and assassins, not a screeching cult
We wait in the shadows and build our strength while our enemies bleed. We don't need a god damn ra-ra chant going on with battle cries and bananas. The math and the data is there, this is a war of attrition. So stick to the plan.  The price is still volatile as shit and there's still an SLV push and tons of bot fud. This tells me that there is still a lot of risk (unlimited) on the hedgehog side.  Anything  under $100 is honestly not a bad entry point based on the news and positioning of the company. Fair market values of $160-$200 have been offered by others with good support considering a turn-around story. Maybe they will take the cube's advice and offer a dividend. Either way, it's going to take time and a set of catalysts to get the squeeze going again.  So here's what you need to do:  1. Calm the fuck down.  2. Get over to   and add in your holdings.  3. Get on vanguard, schwab, fidelity aka a company with a trillion dollar balance sheet.  4. Delete robinyougood   5. Forget you even have GME. Think about buying the dip.  I am not a financial advisor. I am a gamestop shareholder and i like the stock!
If price falls. Do not Panic
Listen here you retards. GME got removed today from NYSE Short Sale Restriction List. If today the price drops again because it‚Äôs likely to happen from market manipulation (I‚Äôm not saying it will for sure), DONT fucking dare to sell your shares to those fuckers that‚Äôs what they want remember that. Hold the line and do not panic sell really is it worthy to sell at this point ? For sure no. My little ape, it‚Äôs better to wait there‚Äôs hope shorts (IMO) haven‚Äôt covered their position yet , as I saw from a very good DD here in WSB, S3 is using a different mathematic formula for the percentage of short position they announced at the public to confuse. The real results will be announced to the public at 2/9 that‚Äôs when we will know for sure the position. If it‚Äôs still high what happens? We are going to the moon. I will post below the DD that explains that better.   Edit: that‚Äôs the   I‚Äôm talking about. There was another one too but it got removed I don‚Äôt know why.  Position: Holding   GME shares even if price goes to fucking 0$.  (I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. I‚Äôm just a retard ape. I might be wrong.)
If this was over, they wouldn‚Äôt be telling you it‚Äôs over. They wouldn‚Äôt care.
Two things stand true  1) Apes! Together! Strong!   2) You Only Live Once   Ride with me to the gates of Valhalla!
Be in it for the long haul. It will make the ride a lot easier.
Retards of the world, hear me out. As long as you keep expecting some big event just around the corner all you are doing is building up anxiety in you and others when you post about it.  Think of it like a long dated call option. You already bought it and now you wait! And here there is no IV crush! It does not matter what the price does today. What matters is what the price does when the shorts close their positions.   In the meantime help by keeping autist's spirits up. Post some dank memes and make retards laugh. They need it now more than ever.
Autists what do you think about this? Let's talk.
These pump NOK ???
Stop paper handing! You help the billionaires become trillionaires!
Keep holding at least until end of April when the hedged calls are expiring. They trust we will lose interest until end of March and are hedging their loss with puts/calls. Lets prove them wrong!
FOMO, Regrets, FUD
Okay retards, we are in the middle of something our beautiful autists discovered by being, well autistic retards. Thanks to them, we are able to sit in the middle of something spectacular. Do you think the HF‚Äôs put out naked calls during the  -up, and continue to do so?  Of course they did... and if not Melvin, some other retard is holding the bag of fucking shit. I will buy some more shares. ‚ÄòCause it‚Äôs a casino and I was in at ~$36, sold off most and got back in at $80 something.   Fucking hell, people are retarded for real if they gamble more than they are willing to lose.  This is WSB ffs. Some strategies work, most fail miserably with loss-porn as result.  Fucking amazing that this have to be spelled out!  Tldr;  You‚Äôre on your own, no one will comfort you when you‚Äôre missing out!      and fuck üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç  /
Coordinated buying i
This shit is important so listen up retards!  If you see posts/ comments saying ‚Äúbuy (insert ticker) at (insert time)‚Äù report them!  This is called market manipulation and is illegal and shit like that will get this sub shutdown!  I know many of you are new to stonks but you can‚Äôt be doing stuff like this, if you do make your own sub and do one!  End of rant.

Can‚Äôt Melvin buy  out of hours? Wouldn‚Äôt this mean we won‚Äôt be able to sell our shares during the short squeeze as it will happen outside of public trading hours?  I like the taste of crayons, only thing I know about stocks is to hold tight  ‚úäüèº

Listen, we all believe in $GME. We treat her like our own child- we feed her gummy bears and coca-cola, and let her play with fireworks. Now, what else would any loving parent do for their child? Probably buy them a fucking PS5 or some shit, right?!?   Enough of that, listen up- we can buy all the stock we want, but that‚Äôs only half the battle. We need to    actually    buy from GameStop. The more money they make, the more valuable the product, the more we fuck over Melvin. We also keep those glorious bastards in their black polos   guys are the real front-line heroes! Out there everyday, just doin it, giving you $  for your Xbox One and 16  !  You want to continue to support the cause? Stop by your local GameStop, buy a fucking Nintendo Switch or one of those cute little Pop! dolls. Buy a fucking candy bar!!! Just think of how wonderful it will be when Andy Left has to turn in the keys to his yacht (do yachts have keys? Idk, I don‚Äôt own a fucking yacht!)   tl/dr: Go to GameStop, buy product, capitalism rules.
We will not let go

I just finished transferring from Robinhood to Fidelity.
I began this process late on Saturday night (31Jan) and as of this morning (4Feb) it has completed.   This is far quicker than I was expecting. This is quicker than Fidelity was expecting. They gave me an estimate of completion by the 8Feb.   I'm saying this to encourage those who were afraid of transferring out of Robinhood that it doesn't take forever.   Transferring from robinhood is a fantastic idea, especially with them having done shady shit.   To all my fellow smooth brains I wish you the best of luck in whatever stocks you purchase and hold. May the moon be within reach and your journey through the cosmos commence.      I have 67 shares GME, 20 AMC, 86 NOK.   Edit: I wrote 8Jan the first time instead of 8Feb.  Edit Edit: Everyone has different experiences. Please take this into consideration if you decide to transfer.  Edit Edit Edit: coins don't transfer. I use AnchorUSD. I dunno how good they are compared to others but they do the dog coins and other coins. This post will get deleted if it says anything about the actual word of this currency.
Anyone else have shares sold by RobinHood without your directive
UPDATE - This issue was due to my account being transferred out of RH to another broker. My apologies for causing confusion.   I was not notified that this was happening today or that it would occur in a gradual manner.   Thanks for the input from all of you.     {Woke up this morning to find more $$ in my RH account and all my GME shares gone. No record of any transactions taken place, all my GME just gone! I did not have orders placed. I was not trading in margin. RH appears to have liquidated my GME holdings and now I see that my AMC and BB shares are listed as negative (-) share numbers.  Anyone else experience this?}
How likely is it that removing comments/topics that don't share the hold/diamond hands philosophy, could be considered market manipulation by the subreddit?
If removing one side of an argument and not another is not considered market manipulation, what is? With the SEC now investigating Reddit and other social media, censorship of opinion, even on a private platform, can be construed as market manipulation, especially considering the apparent stance reddit has for $GME.   Just curious is all.  Still holding @ 115.
Message to people in the film industry - give back to your fans and people who like to go to the movies!
AMC _ do some research and you find you will help a great cause and make a little money doing something to help people who enjoy watching you guys. We don‚Äôt have capital like you; we may have it in numbers. Only a few of you guys helping us is all we need (the more the better obviously) - AMC could turn into the next VW if the film industry gets onboard!! If anything give us some shout outs!!! Lets ruin these hedge funds who are  TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR INDUSTRY  .. don‚Äôt let them, we like the movies, especially the ones coming out this year.. we have cabin fever and want to get out more and more as these vaccines are reaching us!!
GME Why I am here.
Posted in the daily, but I wanted you all to know why I am here, if it matters. This will probably get lost in the shuffle, but what did happen for me  is Gamestop was saved. GME was the place to go when my son wanted a game  . We visited during the pandemic. It was a destination and every day  when we asked was this trip worth it (  hour drive)? The trip to  Gamestop was and the hours of enjoyment from those switch games was  worth it. My son fondly remembers this trip because it has been the only  store we have been asked to leave. (They were over their occupancy  requirements.) We sat outside until we could get in. Saving a company,  new life new PR. That is what holding means to me. I am not in for much,  but I am IN. ( and I hope we are over occupancy on the stock lol)   Shorting is wrong. I don't make much of a difference to the world, but  here I could , maybe.    WSJ I have lady diamond hands. Had to add that. I'm pretty sure WSB is co-ed and I never want to see any of you in my shower haha.  Obligatory rocket emoji.
GME IS DONE YOU RETARDS!!!11!!1!!!
If you want to make the HF's happy, throw more money in. The past week has been wild but that's it. WSB seems to hold on something that's already done, data missing or not, the winners are declared already and once more it's not the retail investors. Safe your bucks for a nice dinner.  Furthermore this sub seems highjacked by someone or   not seen one critical voice here lately. Open your eyes!  Probably get banned, yiihaa.. let's see.
HOLD GME and AMC until it reaches Mars. As if it were your first-born!
We have already achieved a lot, but not yet the goal. Our goal is far away, but so close. So HOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GME was a win! its over! NOW ALL FOCUS TO AMC PLEASE!
GME work was hella win that world heard about it, guys. WELL DONE! Now lets EVERYBODY focus on AMC !!! Please.
Can someone check my maths on this? It's about Shortsight S3 GME Short interest %
Ok so I'm sorry if this was old news or stupid but I'm bad at maths so I was looking up how to calculate short interest. According to   most firms use shorts/float, so if a company has 100 shares and someone short sells 50 shares, that would be 50%?   But shortsight uses shortsight uses shorts / (float + longs created by shortsellers), so 50 shorts on a 100 float company would be 50/150=33%  So these past few days I've been freaking out because "short interest" has dropped from apparently around 120% to just under 60% but   60% = shorts / (float + artificial longs)  means there are 60 shorts for every 100 longs including those longs created by the shorts. Which means 60 artificial longs and 40 float.   Which means short interest calculated by anyone else = 60/40= 150%  I think the last number I saw was 58, so 58/42=138%   So the hedge funds haven't even closed their positions?   Sorry if this is wrong I calculated it the back of a receipt for my wife's dinner with her boyfriend while waiting for them to finish. Also I cannot read and I am bad at maths.
Whats with all this pessimism? I thought we got rid of all paper hands?
As long as we work together and stand side by side we will not just make them suffer for all they've done but also go to the moon and get those tasty tendies my mom gives me when i'm a good boy.   So stay    , HOLD AND BUY AT DIPS!  (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I JUST LIKE THE STOCK AND I'M AN APE)
What's the TLDR of the plan?
I've bought 5k of GME at $90 each today. I understand that I'm supposed to hold. But how long do we hold for? What's the projected price that we should sell at? Best case/worst case?
What is your end game with GME? Serious question.
Every one says hold, hold, hold, but at what point can people ever sell? Let's say GME reached $1000, now what? If a few people start taking their millions in profit out then others will lose everything? No one seems to be able to tell me how EVERYONE investing in GME can keep their profits without bringing the price crashing down very quickly, like in minutes.
Is Elon Musk planning to invest in GME?
Look at his latest Twitter post. Seems like something Thanos would say before snapping his fingers.
Fellow retards, fellow apes - hold strong, don't panic -   üèº
I well and truly believe that the situation is about to turn around now or in the upcoming days.  What happened up until now was a ploy of desperation, and attempt to create panic and FUD, to trigger some stop losses and to get people to sell or cut their positions.  Today is looking better. The price has been looking stable for some time, apparently some restrictions on RH have been rescinded. Buying SHOULD be slightly easier for folks trying to buy now, which probably will help the price.  And what you absolutely shouldn't forget is that Melvin is running out of time, not the retard revolution right here. So long as all retail investors right here keep their    üèº  and stay patient, the situation will turn around, the price will jump back up.  Personally, I've built out my position, I used the past days to bring down my cost basis.  And I'm holding. For the love of god, I am holding, and I am confident. So long as people don't fall for the schemes, I'm confident.  It's an easy job from here on if everyone does their part. Hold and wait. Buy if you want to.     Please note that this is not financial or investment advice. I am by no means an expert, just a lil monke, and I don't even know what this stock does, I just liked the look of the ticker symbol. I also don't really know what flair is the most fitting here so I choose yolo.

HINDENBURG RESEARCH REPORT...
They are releasing a new report today:    Any guesses which company it may be?
Never made so much money in my life.
Bought some pretty expensive puts for GME @360 2/31 and let‚Äôs just say my brokerage account has gone to the fucking moon
Why the shakeout of paper hands is a good thing
Paper hands folding helps with the eventual short squeeze, because those weak hands would be exactly the persons to sell at a relatively slight uptick.    The fact that they sold for so low means they won't be adding sell pressure on the way up, instead they gave a chance to the diamond hands to buy up their shares at a discount.    There's no free rides, for the price to go up, it has to go down first.  The more paper hands fold, the more diamond hands remain, until only diamond hands remain, and then we can set the price we want.
Are retail shorters actually helping us out? [Theory]
I have a bit of a theory that I believe that retail shorters are actually helping us out, hear me out.  Not a financial advisor, just an ape with a dream to visit the moon.  This is regarding AMC, but could also apply for GME's current situation.  AMC currently has a reported short interest of 80% with free float of 56m shares. That means that about   of the shares in the free float have short contracts against them.  The current price drop that we saw, as funds and TUTs are trying to cover their asses, will only attract other retail shorters and institutional shorters who would bet that the price would drop even further, betting against it dropping $8 for example (For AMC).  However, what they are doing in the process is they are occupying the another % of the free float into shares that have short contracts against them - further lowering the total amount of shares that can be bought back by funds and tuts as there are fewer shares available to trade.  I feel like, not only are funds trying to make paper hands to sell their shares which they hold, so there's more supply in the market that will allow to cover the demand without spiking the price like crazy, but also they are trying to lower the price to a point where retail shorters would exercise their short contracts and return a % of the shares back into the public float.  If we were to look at a hypothetical:  Let's say that there are currently 100 shares (float). 80% of them are held by institutions as short interest - they have borrowed them and sold them in the market. That means that tuts need to buy back at least 80% of the float of the market to return to their "owner".  Let's hypothetically say that we, retail investors and institutional investors, own 15% of the free float. But what happens with retail shorters who enter the market, borrow existing shares (presumably from the 15% that we occupy to sell and return to the market. Let's say that they are currently taking up another 10% of the shares. Occupying an even higher amount of shares in the free float with short contracts against them. So, they borrow the shares that were already a part of the supply from the institutional shorters who sold in the market and was consequently bought from a retail investor or institutional investor. If the retail shorters buy back the shares that they have shorted, to return, that's fine for institutional shorters as the float is in their advantage. But if the price does not drop to a point that is comfortable for retail shorters, that leaves them with even less of wiggle room where they will have to buy at an even higher price than the market price.  So in the case of our example of 100 shares, that means that now they have 90% of shares in the float that have short contracts against them with 15% ownership. Meaning that 5% of the shares need to be bought back from second demand instead of primary demand - thus driving the price at which they can buy them back further up, thus further increasing the price of the stock, thus causing the institutional shorters to pay an even higher price, which will further drive up the market price.  Does this make any sense? I kind of suck at explaining shit.  That or I'm just full of shit.  My point being   (TL:DR)   is that, institutional shorters need to drive the price down further not only to make us sell, but to also incentivise retail shorters into exercising their contracts and thus returning the supply back to meet demand, otherwise that would lead to an even higher price jump.  Regardless, I'm holding. I believe in the cause and if it exposes market makers and institutional ownership of our "free market" at the cost of me losing some money (that i'm comfortable losing), then it's a win in my book.  I like the stock. I have spoken.    This is not financial advise. I am not trying to create expectation, but I just have a speculation. The more we talk about this as a collective, the more educated decisions people on this board can make. After all, we are acting as an open access hedge fund at this point lol.  Bombard me with criticism, it will actually help the conversation going.
GSK Share price rock bottom? Is now the time to get in?
After poor figures yesterday GlaxoSmithKlein, UK pharmaceutical company, may be the perfect investment. The share price dropped 5% yesterday on news of a dividend warning for 2022. However revenue and profits for Q4 remained solid. Many new vaccines and drugs are in the pipe line which if successful and with the good publicity may cause the price to reach all time highs in the coming years.  Only my opinion, would be interested to discuss it with other people who also have interest. IMO with the price dipping almost below ¬£  this ‚Äòcould be‚Äô abs opportunity for larger long term gains.
I figured out what is going on with GME, listen
Okay fellow retards, i am either going full retard or full Michael Burry right now.  While my girlfriend was out with her boyfriend and i was playing with my Lego, i figured out what is going on, i am gonna make it very simple, because my brain does not allow me to make complex thoughts, so here goes.  First, we know that Melvin cuckital and other Hedge bros shorted heavily GME, the SI was 200069% and the strike should be fairly low, which leads to a short squeeze, now at this point the losses they were looking at was at the Billions or more ( that's a lot of money, in case you dont understand). A lot of apes here think that they are trying to floor the stock so they can cover their asses and not pay out, but here is the catch, THEY DON'T.  If HFs have so much power to destroy a stock while the price and volume is so fucking high combined with the fact that they can do this while the world is looking at them, then they would be Gazillionaires by now. If a HFs can create so much swing in a stock like GME, then what prohibits them from doing so in a smaller stock with much lower volume and make a shit ton of money all the time, the SEC ??? Fucking lmao if you thought that  My point here is, that we are overestimating their powers and i am going to explain why.  We got the news that shorts covered their positions, which everyone thought was BS, but i believe they actually did, and here is how.  We know that Melvin got around 50 Bn capital a few days ago, so how did they persuade investors to give them money??? Did they tell them they will try to manipulate the stock and bet that people will sell off, do you think rich people heard that and said "Oh yeah, great idea, lets bet 50bn that retarded apes will panic and sell off", fuck no, they proposed a real plan, that would not bet on us doing sane things and i am gonna tell you their plan and why it makes sense.  They know that GME is a ticking bomb, they know that people want GME to MOON, so they hedged their bets by manipulating the stock to drop at 80-90, possibly lower and buy a fuck ton of calls to hedge their retarded bet. They feed the MSM with BS, manipulate the market, so the price drops, then they buy a fuck ton of calls/shares so they will limit their losses or even make more money. S3 partners, media, RH have started acting like our friends now, isnt this a bit suspicious??? It is, because they now want the stock to fucking rocket, so their friends can get their money back.  So what happened is, Melvin got money to buy calls, fed media BS to drop the price and buy calls at good prices, now the media,S3 and RH are with us, the stock will rocket and they will hedge their bets and cover their asses, it all makes sense.  Edit: I am kinda retarded and dont know how to use symbols so more people can understand, sorry Edit 2: I am not a financial advisor, i dont know how the market works, this is not any kind of advice. I have bought 42069 shares of $SUGMA for SEC  TL:DR; Stock will go MOOON MOOON SOON
GME is not over
So much FUD lately.   They want us scared and it is working.   Retards are becoming normal humans.   Retards don't get scared.   I dont see rockets no more.   We achieved so much that we forget about the real reason we invested in GME.   Yes tendies matter but we achieved more than that.   You guys made more than a million retarded friends.   All I hear at my job is gamestop people doing good things.   I heard my coworkers talk about the paperhand guy who donated Nintendos to a Children hospital.   I heard another coworker who talked about the paperhand who paid of their student loan debt.   It's ok to be paperhand if you have the reason.   We all become paperhand. And we cant do that without the diamond hands.   Yall changed the game.   Wallstreet is scared of you guys.   Theybw3ere talking about us jumping to silver when nobody from the top posts even mentioned of silver.   You guys showed which media's are corrupt.   You guys showed who Cramer really is.   You guys showed some billionares that are cool.   You guys showed that the SEC don't really work for the people.  You guys showed Robinhoods true colors.   You guys might even gave old school brokers an idea on how to expand.   You guys made a difference.   I dont think GME rocket is over yet. The first rocket might have failed but what's to say we can't send another one?                                  Totally not a financial advisor. Just some retard who likes stonks, particularly gamestonks!!!!
NEVER FORGET APES TOGETHER STRONG  ü§≤üí™

Anyone referring to a hedge fund as a "hedgie" is either a bot or is under 12 years old.
This term did not exist a month ago, when we were retarded but not stupid.  That is all.
Too many questions being asked
You asking questions like is it over? Then Youre starting to doubt it.  To many doubters posting atm, gtfo out of this group if youre so worried  No room for paper hands  Diamond hands only
Lets Look at GME from a NON-BIAS standpoint
THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVICE I AM NOT A PROFFESIONAL SO PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AS WELL.       I will simplify this very easily so new retards can understand this simply.     1. Short Interest:    This is ultimately why we got in   .   I don't care if you like the stock or not. We all want money at the end of the day, and that's the truth.   We really want those who shorted the shares to finally buyback the shares. The interest rate did drop from 140 to 120. This was a guarantee on the robinhood fiasco day.   That was only 20%  . And we got the confirmation from multiple sources. I am using   which I do understand is not updated as frequently but it did update on that day. It comes as a huge surprise to me that 120 dropped to 51%. Either they bought it from other hedge funds at a background deal, or the day Robinhood manipulated the prices down, that rise up was the shorts selling. Thus we got back to 300ish from the low of 110. In this case, it has squeezed.   In the case it hasn't, the shorts are actually screwed if we just hold (we need a short interest update with actual legitimate facts, I do not know where to get this information besides the website stated. Do not listen to S3 partners, as they have gone back and forth with bs. Its an estimate)       2)   GME & AMC are following the exact same pattern  . This is a huge sign of manipulation. Although that shouldnt come as a surprise. When Robinhood let traders sell, shorts were able to cover for cheap as fuck.   THEY COMPLETELY SCREWED THE MOMENTUM, HOWEVER THIS CAN EASILY CHANGE, AS THERE ARE MORE BUYERS THEN SELLERS.    3)   Silver diversion  : Let me just say this. GME AND AMC are basically the same situation but different Short interest.   If they wanted to divert from GME, they should of said we moved to AMC. But no they specifically mentioned silver. That is a huge sign, and this cannot be understated more that they want to close the movement.   You really need to think about how the news is reflecting this, and how it still continues to reflect it.  4)  GME is still testing grounds: GME is actually hovering 80-100. Like actually??? How is this even possible. We are still in the squeeze.    If it crashed we would actually be at 40 right now.    5) Short Ladder attacks: I was super hesitant to believe this shit. There's no actual sources, but we do have crammer in a video saying what hedge funds do in desperate circumstances.  The legimatacy of short ladder attacks is comparable to the following: This is basically like saying the assassination of Kennedy was not an actual hit, and when cocaine was brought into America, we just didn't have the resources to stop it from coming.    I AM GOING TO BE HONEST, people definitely paper handed at this short ladder attack  .   This would actually bring their short interest down a bit, while keeping the stock price at a safe level.       6)   People are on our side. Listen carefully. We can actually win. I was retarded and thought this was going to be easy.   Of course it wasn't gonna be. Did you know why the Volkswagen short squeeze happened? Because one smart dude decided to hold and not sell, forcing high interest rates and shorts getting margin called. This is inevitable if we drive the price back up, they will be forced to buyback the shares.    WE ALSO HAVE THAT ONE DIAMOND BALLS FCKER> DFV.       TLDR: HOLD         UPDATED SHORT INTEREST:    \  Short interest is 227%..... I have no comments, that is actually insane
I really know nothing...
Ive ordered my very first GME stocks. Only 5. Don‚Äôt have big wallets like I‚Äôve seen some of you guys here.  Guess I bought some because it was based off hype but its a lil cash I‚Äôm not afraid to lose if this thing dies   Not sure about moons or if I want jewellery on my hands (what does diamond hands actually mean?? Haha)  But I‚Äôm just willing to learn and understand how this market works   Cheers everyone
I‚Äôm sorry I have to sell my GME stock.
So I own just own a few stocks of GME and I love helping the cause but holy shit, I just arrived to Mazatlan, Mexico and got all of my clothes and the Bose headphones (which my GF gifted me a week ago) stolen.  I‚Äôm sorry for selling and failing you WSB. Greetings from Mexico. Best of wishes.
Premarket Volume
Not sure what this means or if its normal, but the volume for gme is   as it stands now versus 824k as of closing, does this mean that we held and bought?
Looking For A Robinhood Clone To Buy GME
In a show of solidarity I took my assets out of Robinhood.  But I‚Äôm having seller‚Äôs remorse.   I loved Robinhood‚Äôs idiot-proof easy platform.  What brokerage apps are most similar to RH?
Okay guys, let's talk numbers: how can we be sure that she squeeze hasn't happened yet?
Our biggest point of information is the monthly report of short %. Can we say for sure that the squeeze hasn't happened yet? We hear Melvin lost 6 billion through GME. Maybe they used those billions to cover their shorts?  On the other hand, why would they start with short ladder attacks and RHs manipulation AFTER the GME stock hit its ATH?  Just trying to make sense to all of this. I mean I'm holding no matter what but it would be easier if I had proof.  Edit: well, I didn't know what I expected but it's either none sensical HOLDs or IT ALREADY Happened without any proof from either side.  What about all those calls that got made for 800 $ for millions? How do we explain those?
ELI5: Why are you guys still holding GameStop?
Sorry, I am pretty young and do not know anything about what is going on or stocks in general, I just saw this happening on the news and YouTube a few days back and was curious. I have a question though, why are you guys still holding in GameStop and others when it‚Äôs losing you money? I always see posts saying ‚Äúhold the line‚Äù and shit and was wondering why. Sorry if this is a dumb question! Thanks Edit: ohh ok I get it ;) u guys don‚Äôt wanna get in trouble. Can someone PM me explaining it? Thx. You could use a throwaway account
We are still in this fight
I've been lurking in this sub for a while now, looking at all the incredible gains and hilarious losses. I got a lot more involved during the GME hype. I bought stocks having no idea what I was doing. I was scared, but I got lost in all the hype and said fuck it! I made a decision only a tard would make. Being in this sub over the last week or so had been the best experience I've ever had in my years on this platform and I'll never forget all this. It seems as though the leadership of the sub has interesting plans for the future of WSB. A turn that none of us expected. This has caused a lot of panic and uncertainty to cloud my mind. I know a lot of other people are experiencing the same thing. This is why as a newb lurker with no experience in the stock market whatsoever, I feel the need to say this:  #I'M STILL NOT FUCKING SELLING         i like the stock too damn much  I don't even know what financial advice looks like so don't bother asking me.
To counter bot-spams please have a script that displays the ‚Äödays-in-the-sub‚Äò or reddit age in the title of the post.

ATVI Earnings Options Play
Thinking about making some calls here. God knows Shadowlands killed it and COD continues to take in that money.

Make a new wsb with id verification
Ive seen a lot of posts lately and it has come to my mind why dont we do another /r/ but with id verification this way we short out the bots?  Edit: Many apps and websites require id identification we could sort out some sort of link that verifies authenticity if such website exists of course, or some sort of one time captcha verification  Or some bot that only accepts reddit users over 1-2 years and checks the comments and posts that it does to see if its repetitive comments or posts  Edit: could do a minimum karma/to post like other subs do
What are the odds of a Gamma Squeeze happening?
i have diamond hands but they are becoming bloody red. How long do I have to f\ ing hold on? And what are the odds of it happening?
Sold every share I own...
That's right, I sold everything. AND I USED THAT MONEY TO BUY MORE FUCKING GME. I'm going to hold those bad Boys until $10k a share. I lost 3k euros so far, which is huge for a romanian college student like myself. Don't give up. Don't lose hope. The hedgies are getting desperate, but we keep fighting. We have way more power than we think we have. HOLD THE LINE BOYS, EYES ON THE PRIZE. WE GOT THIS, NO MATTER THE TRICKS THE HEDGIES USE TO STOP US. Diamond hands, now and forever. Fuck the bots, fuck Melvin.          not financial advice P. S. I've been a lurker here for quite some time, I didn't use to spend a lot of time on reddit. Until now.
Next price to buy in again? Another rally in the near future?

Degiro and Saxo now have long lines to join the ride (5-10 days).
Saxo are quoting 2-3 bank days to process  accounts. Degiro are quoting up to 10 working days for information to be verified. I'm not sure how many recently afflicted retards are effected by this but it could be anything between a little and a lot. The long wait time suggests it is more than a little; otherwise why the long wait time? Either way it is highly likely that there are retail investor tendies out that want to be invested in owning GME but have been put on hold by the brokers. That demand is still there in the background and it will eventually manifest in the market. What do I think this will mean for the GME price? No idea but I'd be interested in opinions...  TL;DR - Hold reinforcements are coming     Edit: I know some applications are processing faster - but some are not. Like any theme park the popular rides have long lines regardless of how fast they are moving. What is of interest to me is the length of the line and how it might manifest.
Does anyone take this subreddit as legitimate investment advice?
Let‚Äôs be honest, how many of you retards/autists/degenerates actually consider anything said on WSB to be taken in any form as legitimate investment advice?   Every day there are dozens of posts that make the disclaimer that ‚Äúthis is not investment advice‚Äù as if some loser might take their shit post written from their bedroom in their mother‚Äôs basement as legitimate DD and reason to pour your life‚Äôs savings into some dying boomer stonk that has miraculously climbed 500% in the past 2 weeks.  Common, let‚Äôs hear it.  Who‚Äôs retarded enough to take all of this seriously?  Will the real retards please stand up?
Hold Hold Hold Fam and stay Encouraged
Just your average investor here letting you guys know you all are the reason we are doing so well at $90 a share! We ARE THE FUCKING ANCHOR of APES BOYS AND GALS! AND WILL HOLD! ! ü™ù‚öìÔ∏è‚öìÔ∏èHowever much you put in GME doesn‚Äôt matter, because what matters is your will to win. Idk about you but I‚Äôm invested in GME just as much as those who‚Äôve lost thousands to millions of dollars from investing in GME and I fucking hate losing. This is one of those challenges I‚Äôm going to pursue trying to win no matter what. Even if it takes months to years. I‚Äôll put fractional shares in or whatever dollars I can into helping buy the stocks supply up so we can beat these cheats. I‚Äôll admit I originally invested because a friend was doing well in the stock and I wanted to make a few bucks, but today I invest and hold my speck of shares because I learned a great deal about shorts and the injustices of the stock market. I‚Äôve lost quite a bit of money, but I don‚Äôt care because I know we have a good shot at reviving Gamestop by buying up all the shares. Red or green doesn‚Äôt mean shit when we know the truth about who owns most of the shares and that us! I can totally can get behind this stock and know it‚Äôs for a good cause. Because fuck, who doesn‚Äôt like video games and want to not only take this stock to the bloody moon?!  üõ∏Even though, our market price looks shitty right now, it‚Äôs not. In fact, it‚Äôll never be no matter how cheap or expensive it is because either way we plus!! It‚Äôs a blessing in disguise because we‚Äôre getting a fucking discount when it‚Äôs low and making gains when it‚Äôs high! üòÉWhen I approach life I see strength in weakness and this is one of those things, it‚Äôs just a matter of perspective. I don‚Äôt urge you to over spend(know your limits and be financially healthy individuals),but rather  I urge you to never lose hope and stay true to what you know and believe in. I‚Äôm learning patience and self control while trusting the process because I know and understand it. All I can say right now, is that my plans are to HOLD and buying more if the price ever drops because I LIKE THIS STOCK!... and you RETARDS OF COURSE!         ü¶ß ü¶ß ü¶ß ü¶ß APE STRONG FAM!
4:00AM Pre-Market Hype
Up at 4AM because I'm JACKED TO THE TITS  Here's what I need everyone to do. Wake up at 8:20, and immediately take 3 shots of alcohol. Then at 8:26, put on headphones, start playing Pantera at max volume, and start jerking off so that the song and your dick both peak at market open.   We don't stop when the momentum dies, we stop when we are in gainsville, and maybe not even then. We ride till the end you dumb fucking apes, and no amount of "realist" or "sobering" posts on this will change who you are at the deepest level. A diamond handed retard.  I am pretty new here, and this is my first post. I have no clue how to analyze a stock or how to look at data, and the best part is that I don't even give a fuck. I just like the fucking stock. I honestly kind of hope the price keeps going down so that I can keep flexing these hands. This stock makes me want to cum all over the place. I'm actually getting a boner writing this post right now.  Just by still holding, you are stronger than everyone else. You won't let these slimey smear tactics and market manipulation get to you because you are just built different. You are a magnificent, mentally deficient, large-cocked animal and you should be proud.  Alright fellas, I didn't hear no bell. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE   GME TO THE MOON BABY
Smart dummy or all meme
After the GameStop rally, WSB has become a joke. I personally think WSB has more to it than teenagers YOLOing and memeing. I‚Äôve personally found good picks and opportunities in the threads.   Diamond hands are good and all, but a company with enormous potential ruined by shorts is the one who deserves those hands. Lately all the TRASH companies who‚Äôve deceived investors for years are getting false hype and careless diamond hand crap. We are better than this. Let‚Äôs promote companies with potential (like Nio back in 2020) instead of YOLOing on companies which are out there to tell you ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre adopted.‚Äô   Sincerely Fellow retard who buys shorts too (Newsflash: Even common man buys puts; you can‚Äôt let companies like Nikola commit fraud by deceiving and get away. Happens with many pharma companies too.)
That was a Quick Shift from Gain to Loss Porn
Misery loves company. My wife‚Äôs boyfriend is hanging at our house 24/7. Diamond Hands, and yet he may puke it all out at the lows. That   looks pretty damn good right now.
If you're worried take a break!
Morning fellow retards,apes &autists.  I saw a post like this the other day but I feel like the point needs to be shared again.  We have done some crazy things in the past week and things are on the turn again but if your struggling with the losses and like me you find yourself watching the stock from open to close... Take a break, put your phone down if you get worried "oh I'll miss the rocket", put a stop limit in or a reminder on the stock price.  I'm seeing a lot of posts of people saying they've put house money in or there life savings... Firstly good work but just be careful none of us are financial advisors and YOU did that. so in my opinion just ride it, lower your average on the dips but don't put in more than what you have. your all adults.  Just watch your mental health and if you need support use the comment section to vent.  ‚úåÔ∏èPeace from inferior ape  ü§≤
Gme
Y'all should stop holding gme before y'all lose all your money. Just saying.
AZN -- nothing but good news, analysts have it as 'strong buy', yet underperforms. Since there are   of you here now, I'm sure someone can explain why
While waiting for GME to dip to buy more, I was checking out some other stuff, and AZN (maker of a Vaccine that recently got approved & got orders from the EU) hit my radar.   I checked some stuff and it seemed like a good bet that's currently 12% even onder it's 'low' price target, yet people don't seem to like this stock at all üòÖ (went down instead of up after positive news). Anyone who can shed some light here? I bought 20 shares because I think, in the short-medium run, it should at least catch up a bit to the expected value (as I could not see a reason why not), but I'm still a total noob at this and would love to hear some things I might have missed while going over some stuff.
Experts - $goev - can it be gamma squoze?
I like this stonk and not financial advise.   Looking at the options chart, looks like it only goes out until august this year. And there seems to be a strong bull sentiment on this one. (Lots of good dd made already)  Relatively small float of   shares and 10M of them have been shorted...  Might looking to adding some otm calls for the next few months...  Anyone else see what I‚Äôm seeing? Open to discussing.
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening other than we are diamond handing this
I had 18,2 shares at $43 and i have averaged up and bought 5 more at $100. This is going to the moon whether the SEC like it or not.
I think i got an idea how price moves down while retail buy more and more
Since Citadel could execute orders before retail and have all information about retail they could use a very simple tactic.     Once send market order - they just before you send limit sell right before latest ask price and for right amount of shares (or may be +1 share more). That will give you a little bit cheaper price for a share, but price would go down.     This also explains why germans are hos powerful in their game very day: their orders are not front-runned by some hedge fund.
We need Whales to assist. How can we get them to?
This world is a place of what‚Äôs in it for me? I‚Äôm not familiar with Wall Street legalities and I am 100% not condoning any kick backs at all. Last time I checked there are 8 million subs here and movements require mass. We are here whales - all I can ask is if you truly believe in our cause then you are a key factor. I am not at all educated with the market and anything I say should be taken with a grain of salt. None of this is financial advice because I‚Äôm only a retard.
European Trading Platforms?
Hey guys. I‚Äôm an American transplant living in Europe and was wondering if anyone has any advice about trading platforms that are worthwhile/trustworthy in EU
Holding AMC with diamond hands... but what's the situation for the squeeze?
So yeah, I'm currently holding my 268 AMC stocks (bought high at $  and have been doing so since Friday. We've been told to hold, and I'm continuing to do so, until we go to the moon. But when can we expect to see some actual hedge fund action, that is when are they forced to actually make good on their bets? I was told they were due all days this week and that everyone should hold until at least Friday (some said Thursday, today), can we expect the squeeze to happen today or tomorrow, or are we right now just holding to fuck with the hedge funds (which I have no trouble doing)?  Would love some answers on this, not because I'm cashing out but because there seems to be conflicting information everywhere regarding this.
Thoughts from a diamond handed noob
Just wanted to get a few things off my chest here. Perhaps just the ramblings of a pissed off American.  First off, I‚Äôm new here. I caught the hype train and got in too late. Figured it could go either way but was worth a shot. Who knows what could still happen, but you know what? I WILL NOT SELL THESE SHARES! If this stock goes down to 10 cents/share I WILL STILL HOLD. Idgaf. Here‚Äôs why:  It has NEVER been more obvious to me that the playing field is not even. We are so outgunned and outmatched it‚Äôs ridiculous. IM SICK OF IT. I watched all these paper handed tards come in here, buy stock, then cower and  fall for the HF/Uber Wealthy‚Äôs scare tactics.   I have known for a long time (as Im sure most/all of you do) that the people with insane amounts of money run the entire fucking world. Everyone knows that. This week was the first time I‚Äôve witnessed the impact of their lying, corrupt, human garbage ways in real time. I watched them deny potential retail investors, Manipulate the market RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD, spread false narratives in the media, distract us with silver, DIVIDE AND CONQUER, and use scare tactics to get people to sell. AND all you dumbass paper handed fucks fell for it and played right into their hand.   This is about more than money. Of course, I‚Äôd LOVE to make some on this stock, but I truly don‚Äôt give a shit if I do or not. I WILL NOT GET ON MY KNEES AND GET IN LINE FOR THEM. This is a principled stand against the puppet masters. Wake the fuck up and realize that these people are the real enemy. They will steamroll anyone and anything in their path. They will destroy anything they can if it means they get deeper pockets. They will do anything to keep us common apes from coming to their doors.. no matter how many lives get destroyed.   To be clear, I don‚Äôt blame anyone for cutting their losses at this point. People invested way more than they could afford, which was your first mistake. If selling your shares is what‚Äôs best for you and your family, make that choice and go forward with a clear conscience. I just truly hope that people have learned something here. Not only about how to invest.. but about the system. I sure as hell have.   End rant. There‚Äôs more I want to say but this should suffice.   All I know is that you OG diamond hands can count on me to hold onto GME. I will not fucking sell. Proud to be a member of this sub.
DONT GET DISTRACTED   IF YOU CAN AND HOLD IT ..
as you all know Bunch of vegan soyboy that eats kale chips while listening to taylor swift infiltrated our     will not go away..   HOLD..      .  edited for position  gme 40  , BB
Hear that??
That was the sound of the hedgies shitting themselves. The sweat trickles down their foreheads. They sit uncomfortably. They twitch. They hope we sell. We don‚Äôt. GME, to the moon or not, I will not sell. Fuck you. Lads we are winning this - literally gme is at 92?? Today we need a big push to really fuckin show them what‚Äôs going on
Persevere my fellow a$$tronauts
We all wanna be the protagonist of our movie. We see ourselves as the hero in the leather jacket with a devil may care attitude and a massive   inch c0ck. But how does a hero become a hero. Does he just get lucky? No. Does he get what he wants easy? No. Does he crawl and mooch his way to the top like a right kuk? No. What does he do? He Perseveres. When he's down at the bottom he reflects on that and he does what he has to. He. Perseveres. He continues on the path that is shitty and dirty and riddled with non believers to get where he wants to get.  I remember when GME was on the fucking rise, wallstreetbets was everywhere. Every other post on the front page, on twitter, people associating themselves with it. And now that GME is in the red, people mock us. They call us fools for standing up to the big boys. This. Is. A. Test. Fack those flaky motherfacking captain hindsight non believing cunts. All you have to do is know that we are still here. We might not be as visible or audible as before, but we, The Holders, ARE HERE!  So if tomorrow GME goes further down and people start throwing sh!te at us calling us retards for backing the wrong f   ing horse, just know one thing- THE HOLDERS ARE HERE. And they are holding. The doubters are here too. The naysayers. The bots. The clowns. The schadenfrauding aholes who get hard when they see other people lose. The trolls. They all are here but they DONT MATTER. All that matters is the cause. And the cause is- to make some mafking money! And we will get there. Together. $1000 is still not a fucking meme. No bell no sell.  This is in no way financial advice. I eat crayons dipped in as$ milk. Do your research and know that this is the part of the movie before the climax where everything is shit. Persevere
Challenge
I have an idea which just came up, i challenge every person which hase time and 100‚Ç¨/$/¬•/¬£ what ever to spare and try to get the most out of it in February just with trading (doesnt matter what kind of as long as those 100 are the start)
GME is floating around $90. Has anyone considered the alternative scenario where people can't trade because they're moving accounts from Robinhood?
I think there isn't enough "buying" momentum simply because of the backlogs and verification processes of firms that are seeing a sudden influx of people signing up to trade with them. They weren't prepared to handle that sudden rush of customers and now they're sifting through accounts activating them, receiving funds, etc.  I don't think the week will end well for GME (and by that I mean its not going to start going up). I think next week is going to be a bull run when trading companies work through the weekend to clear up the back log of new customers.  Also, has everyone forgotten about BB and AMC? I expect a rally for AMC coming soon.  I'm just a play-doh eating retard, this is therefore not financial advice or speculation. These observations were made based on where my piss landed when I urinated in the wind.
‚â•100% SI is NOT conclusive proof of naked shorting
Here's why.  I'm fucking broke because I bought GME at $350 and    on Tuesday. This means that when I run out of instant lemonade to snort and need more, I go get a grand from a payday lender. There is now $1,000 of debt (owned by the payday lender) and $1,000 of cash (owned by me).   The day after I take out my loan, my cousin Dan comes whining to me because his deathtrap beater broke down. (He shorted GME at $5 during the summer, so he's even more broke than I am.) Since I'm a sap, I loan him enough to get it fixed, say $500. Remember, I'm broke too, so that $500 comes out of the $1,000 I got from the payday lender.  Here's the important part: There is still only $1,000 of cash ($500 owned by Dan, $500 by me), but the amount of debt has gone up to   $1,500   ($500 owned by me, and the original $1,000 owned by the payday lender).   This is not illegal  , or even against the rules (to a greater extent than that the payday lender will be squeezing my balls, so I have a strong incentive to get up Dan's ass about his share‚Äîbut at the end of the day that's a problem for the three of us and the local law enforcement couldn't give a shit).   Shares that are sold short are just shares to the people who buy them, so they can usually be borrowed and sold short again . This makes it possible for a stock to have, in theory, infinity% SI without a single naked short existing.   Do naked shorts of GME probably exist anyway? If the fail-to-deliver statistics that have been posted here are remotely accurate, I would lean strongly towards yes. Is it still retarded to short a stock ‚â•100% of float (and will that probably produce a short squeeze)? Also yes. Does shorting still dilute the market and expose the shorter to significant risk even if it's not naked? Yes. But none of those mean you should go around stating GME's SI (real, theoretical, or historical) as any kind of proof that it's been shorted naked. Get better evidence and know what you're talking about.
Disclaimers for new diamond-handed, autistic, retarded apes
I'm not entirely new to this sub but I haven't been active until recently... Can a kind veteran please explain the full importance of these disclaimers that I'm seeing around: "I am not a financial adviser" "I am an autistic retard who eats crayons" Etc.  Why exactly is (almost) everyone using them?  When and where should they be used?  Thanks (I know a Google search could probably explain it but I want to here from someone who's been in the sub awhile)
Hot take - SLV misinformation is a good thing
If we want to ape strong together to take down the evil hedgies, then they need to be allowed to play the game too.  You want a more level playing field? This is going to be a part of it. The big boys being able to come to Reddit, or whatever news network they have on the hook and spread misinformation is just a part of the game that‚Äôs evolving all the time. We just have to be better at it than them.
Does anyone know if Think or Swim has the Donchian Indicator?

Newest member of the GME 1 share club...finally.
Was finally able to buy a share of GME through RH  üèª. I have a question for all of you stock market savvy people out there. I was thinking about investing in cannabis, since many states have voted to legalize for recreational use, and wondered if anyone has any insight as to which companies are ones to look into.
Hedge Funds using bots on WSB to try and find the next ‚Äúbig stock‚Äù
‚ÄúHedge funds, investment bankers and other institutional investors are desperate to find the next GameStop -- before it's too late.

Weed through the bullshit and make decisions that matter
This week is not like last week. Shit went down, and everyone that bought in late is suffering. Look at your options: either sell now and lose for sure, or hold on and potentially win.  Yes, you may lose more if you hold, but losses are guaranteed if you pull out now. I, personally, am down 50% of a 30k buy in at $180. If I sell, I'm out $15k guaranteed. I can reinvest that money, but I would need a 100% gain to get it back.  That sort of win usually requires a high risk gamble, and usually doesn't pan out.  So why not hold instead?  Let's see the plan through. It may not hit 1k, 5k, or 10k.  But if we hold, we can get back to 400.  Maybe even 500 or 600.  Maybe even more. Who knows. But what we do  know is that selling is a guaranteed loss. Up to you.
now what for non-us citizens?
ok so ive been reading that many are moving away from RH and now choosing fidelity. but thats only applicable for US Citizens... so how bout those residing outside the US? what are the recommendations to keep that low fees whilst still being relatively credible and easy to use. I'm looking for 1 where to minimum is less than <$10k and that they offer fractional shares too. Any recommendations is much appreciated. (update: I am from Singapore)

Robin Hood data selling
I know this is obvious to some but the reason Robbin Hood and other free platforms are free is because they sell all your trading data and habits to the big guys. This means that everything most people on here are doing or planning (orders and alike) are on the screens of Wall Street investors. It‚Äôs important not to use free trading platforms for this reason.
4 Feb 2021 Part 1 - relax
Good morning from the UK. Best of luck for today. Just relax, no need to panic, I'm sure things will get better. Do something different today for your wellbeing. Set a price alert and put your phone down.  Don't forget, only spend what you can afford to lose in the worst case scenario. I bought some stocks because I can afford to lose it all and it won't make a difference to my financial circumstances.   We all knew HF were crooks and never played fairly; the GME move just proved this fact and illustrated that these scums will do anything in their power, including but not limited to, openly breaking the laws and regulation, in order to win. Needless to say, they must be so frustrated right now because none of their tactics have really worked: market manipulation (stopping the public from buying freely by bribing shit brokers like RH), ladder attack (selling to their own partners to bring the price down), use of media to spread fake news, bribing government officials and so on. I feel like the more they try the more they fail.   I'm sure our FCA is a lot better than your SEC when it comes to bringing the scums down. It seems your SEC is ran by some cowboys / sponsored lawyers. What I don't understand is what in the world is FBI doing when HF are openly committing crime in daylight?!  I am not going to sell because no matter HF dirty tactics, they don't have a leg to stand on. I am not a financial advisor but I have strong common sense.
What would you do if you were GameStop CEO right now?
I personally would be investing a part of this recent capital increase into founding an eSports organitzation.  This has been proven to be a high reward business if you manage to create a good fanbase and corporate image.
Cry babies over GME, and influx of normie defeatist. (Discussions).
100% financial advice, my name is Jack meihoff i work as a fiduciary at your mom's anus LLC. Daily high volume trades of every board member on the SCC's grandmas buthole.   My favorite thing about this sub isn't how we take on the "system." It was how we were all making trades trying to predict the system.   Milton "iron balls" Friedman came out with the truth what 50 years ago? Companies are out to get money and if you don't like it we don't give a fuck.   Of course robinhood fucked us. If your working at Wendy's do you give a shit about the mouthbreather in your drive thru? Pov: working at Wendy's somebody offers you 10k to jizz on a burger and feed it to the customer ü§î. I don't know about you but I'm dropping a fat load and using the money to cover my retard smooth brain calls or my obsessive hentia collection.  Now we're filled with a bunch of soyboys crying about how the system is rigged.  10 weeks ago Somebody would yolo 100k and we would all laugh. We would make jokes about how he's gonna be sucking ducks off at the park.  This is wall street stop being a fucking pussy. If you can't handle getting fucked over on some trades go buy CD's or keep your money in a savings account that is depreciating simply from the cost of inflation. You don't get 100% returns from super safe investments, and if your buying options you basically fucking gambling.   If you bought GME at its peak your in too fucking deep now so you mine as well hold. You bought it b4 the rise your fucking greedy, 4$ to 90$ isn't enough after your smooth brain ass didn't sell at 400$ cause a guy you never met posted a emoji. My 3 year old niece knows how to use emoji and I'm not consulting her on my financial advice. 9900% increase wasn't enough?
Guys I feel sick put everything I had $900 in hope of a little life changing moment & feel cheated by criminal manipulation & tactics from hedge funds
I've been debating to post this or not but I feel sharing it and writing this down will help.   I've been really depressed for months and always have suicidal thoughts throughout my life and last week I was feeling very low and heard of all this GME and the positivity of it all and down with it, I was in need of a little happiness and good fortune while helping others at the same time.   I don't have a lot but I put in everything I had $100 @ 338 and then $400 @ 330 to hold for a longtime and then bought more, the money I needed to live on to try cover my loss as I thought it would go up within a few days. I own   shares. With a -$650 loss starting with $900  But Its now looking like I will have to sell everything at about $90 as I'm completely out of money and in debt.   I feel sick, cheated and now even more broke and broken.   It's not right the criminal activity and manipulation of the hedge funds lowering the value of the shares!   The incorrect information and lies from mainstream media and manipulation to drive people not to buy resulting in the share value going down.   Restricting free trade by many trading apps not allowing people to buy and only sell.  Hugely impacting the value by causing panic and mass selling resulting in the value of shares going down.   Where is the justice and hope for the small people if we are restricted from fair trade.   Hope it rockets after I'm out you all make life changing gains if I wasn't in debt and broke I would hold    Edit: I know it was completely my mistake putting the money i needed in. And the blame is completely my own and I will suffer because of that. I've never gambled before but then we could say everything we do in life is a gamble. But I thought of it as a investment to hold and something to actually own.   900 is a lot for me as I currently don't work due to my mental health. I'm a ex soldier and 33.  I did do my research and wouldn't say I'm dumb just a very bad, stupid decision after the money i was going to hold with. Maybe my mental health played apart of that or I was just not thinking in the moment.   Thanks for the positive comments and messages from others that have suffered also.  And thanks for constructive criticism it helps also.  To all the ppl telling me to hold out longer I wish I could.
A non-technical take on AMC
I'm a measly 40 @   for now (buying tmrw), and I am fully dedicated to AMC and will be holding and investing everything I can afford for the long play. Right now for the reason of the movement, but here is another major reason why I know it, and other theaters will blow.  Think about it, the future of workmanship, UBI, AI taking over jobs, it will pressure society to rethink what it means to live and enjoy life in the next 10 years.  What does one do if they have free money, no work, and the desire to do SOMETHING?  They do one (or more) of 3 major things:  - They learn / explore - They socialize / connect - They have fun / seek entertainment  AMC is step 3 of this societal change, but most importantly, step 2 as well. It resolves the human desire to both socialize and be entertained.  That is why I am convinced things like digital/physical entertainment will blow up like mad. It seems trivial, but old school physical theatres are going to be huge as we go back to our roots. There is also a massive opportunity in VR as well.  What are your thoughts on entertainment stocks outside of this movement?  Edit: To add, I think this interest for physical entertainment will never die down as humanity advances because once we peak in terms of mobile / VR technology, we will be far more intrigued to go back to our roots. Its for this reason that physical sports will never die. The reason athletes arent just hopping on digital hockey, soccer, football etc.
People say do a DD on the stonks but you should also do it on the users submitting here...
Here me out, I've seen overwhelming positivity for this movement. I'm in, an ape and holding but I respected the advice and only put in what I can loose (2 GME & 22 AMC).  However amongst all the positivity is some very mellodramatic negativity. So naturally I had a look at these posters and here's what I'm finding: -Commenting multiple times on different threads within minutes/seconds -Copy and pasted comments in different threads -Silent/Lurker accounts becoming suddenly vocal -Purchases of Reddit gold? -Accounts and posts being deleted if being downvoted by apes too hard  It's the first point that makes me think there is a bot brigade as everyone suspects.  I'm not going to name names but just try this. Go to rising, find a negative post/comment insulting the person or user for their comment/submission   'idiot' or 'ban' etc. Then have a look at that negative bastards history.  I'm retarded so don't take my advice but if we can confirm bot brigading then there's definitely something to this movement that has HFs scared.
Infinite profits!
Moon is the only conclusion we will accept.
Bought 6 GME @ 95 from Australia.     There seems to be a lot of fake posts and bots on here trying to disguise the fact that GME IS GOING TO THE MOOOOOOOONNNNNN              This is not financial advice and don't know how many bots there are.
What sets a 1000$ GME ticker?
What stops everyone from just trading GME at 1000? Or rather what specifically sets the ticker to 1000?    I... Don't really understand how a demand for a specific price of a stock is reached by consensus from individuals who can't decide on anything.  Thanks for answering my dumb question (even though I can't appear to see any of the replies on my phone)--I guess set your limit sales at 1000$ if that is the goal. So I've done my part; Buy, set limit at 1k and walk away.  The synopsis was pretty much what is to be expected. Supply and demand, but the supply is below a demand of 1000. There just needs to be less supply below 1000$.  I was told there was supposed to be blackjack here.   I think it goes without saying I'm not a financial advisor and if I were yours...   ?
What do you think people will do?
The past few days has been brutal for alot of people. We've watched as our money has dwindled down. When/if the price goes back up do you think people will sell at their cost average and get out while they can? I know I've thought about it... then I decided to just ride this ride till the bottom or the top.  144 @ $251
Dont listen to paper hands
Last 2 days there have been huge amount of bullshit posts about that people should sell and we might lose. Stop that bullshit!  They are continuing to short ladder attack us and only with    can we win this shit. Only the true soldiers are left now and we never lose!  Jump aboard the rocket cuz its time for LIFT OFF!!             120 GME @ 80$ 200 AMC @ 11$
GameStop: Is it possible that an enormous options program for employees and new exec hires is what we see?
If I was the dictator of GameStop, I guess that means Ryan Cohen, I would buy millions and millions of far OTM calls ($800?) and shower employees with these as part of the compensation package for a strategic transformation. Combined with some vesting schedule like perhaps 3 years where the contract is void if they leave the company.  If I was sitting on shorty mc shorts this would scare the hell out or me.   The next step would then be to slowly and steadily release news about the new strategy. One little piece at a time, a few days apart, for a very very long time. Together with a charming communication strategy which rally employees, fans of the company, and us who Like the Stock. You are recommended and more than welcome to belong to all three of these categories if you ask me.   We like the Stock!  In the middle of this rallying movement also bring on the news about RC himself increasing his position towards  , in several small batches so those news can hit outlets and the street in a flow.   Beneath all this there are us in GME Gang, old and new members with Diamond Hands and conviction. APES TOGEHER!  Also keep up the relentless vigilante billboard  , in the long run this kind of movement is supporting the chances of an epic turnaround to succeed. Imagine going to work at your local GameStop store in the morning and you see one of these beauties, I would be inspired to stick around and do my best.   This entire event around the Short Squeeze, the politics, the story, has put the brand on the radar of the entire world in a way rarely seen, it is value in itself to be added to the fundamentals of the company. If I wanted to buy a brand awareness   for the company I work at we would need to fork up more money than the GameStop current market cap, not kidding.     GameStop, like a Phoenix, rises from the smoldering ruins of its own history. This is my prediction and it is one demanding patience.     Now you shoot this down, what in my prediction is wrong? Is there a better way to go about it? Are there some legal constraints preventing this type of operation or something? Have at it and bring my little ego back to earth.     Pos: 1450 $GME. Paper handed some.. doh. Had to reduce my exposure from 4350 to be able to stay on this Tiger without constant fear of having made a huge mistake as I was 95% in which was bad for my weak brain.
Parents say I cannot invest in stocks due to the nature of my dad's job, are there any other feasible ways I can gain a substantial amount of money to pay for college?
So I'm a 19 year old college kid who's struggling to pay for college and just generally sustaining myself through life (food, paper towels, tissues, laundry stuff, cleaning stuff, haircuts, etc.).  My parents are barely helping me at all (I have to pay out of my own pocket for sustaining myself as well as the majority of my tuition) and I wanted to join you guys and try to make a bunch of money through investing. The problem though is that my parents, especially my dad, aren't letting me invest in any stocks because my dad works for a bank that doesn't want its employees to invest in stocks because "things can get too complicated with conflicts of interest".   I really need the money for a legit purpose and it sucks because I see so many people, especially kids around my age, making shit tons of money from investing with your sub's advice in mind and I feel really left out. Taking the Wall Street Bets route to success seems like the perfect opportunity to help pay for my college tuition as well as helping sustain myself. Even though I'm legally an adult, I'm still legally a "dependent" (which is ironic because I have to be INdependent most of the time) and don't have much autonomy.  So, my question to y'all is how can I make a substantial amount of money to help me move forward if I don't have the option to invest in stocks?  Is the Wall Street Bets life a dream that will never come true for me, in your opinion?
Quit listening to DFV. He's irrelevant now.
Seriously, quit listening to DFV. He was a retard that got lucky a year ago, and I hope he cashes out last week. He was retarded, but you guys that keep buying GME now are fucking dumb. It went to the moon, and it came back. I'm sorry. It already went to the fucking moon, and it will not go back until probably next year.
THIS IS WHY ITS TIME TO SELL
WSB ... what has happened to you? The place where I could go to find some actual retard advice? The one place Where I felt at home where people actually didn‚Äôt care about me? Not more gme billboards. I have gme shares. I don‚Äôt know shit about fuck. But where is the community? No, really tell me because I am done with this cult of shit fucks who want a quick buck and don‚Äôt wanna share the loss porn. I‚Äôm broke I don‚Äôt have loss porn. I think the biggest problem with the squeeze being squoze was TOO MUCH DAMN ATTENTION. A true monster doesn‚Äôt RaWR at you!! It welcomes you warmly into its arms, embracing the squeeze. THEN YOU DIE.  I have 5 share of GME I‚Äôm poor fuck you.  If you think this is financial advice LOL
LEGAL READ REGARDING GME/ROBINHOOD/MELVIN (Obligatory    )
Ok, so I'm really tired and I have class soon so it's not going to be as detailed as I want it to be but I went down a legal research rabbit hole and found some stuff that I hope you GME tendie lovers appreciate.  For starters, look into "bear raids." Just Google bear raids and you will see that they're (usually) pretty freakin' illegal. And if you've been a real wsb   who's been following what's going on (no, not that garbage on cnn, wsj, etc.) you'll see that what RH, the HF, etc did/still-doing is a transparently illegal bear raid. And this doesn't just involve SEC acts but also other fields of law, like freakin' RICO. I shit you not here is case law: Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited v.   Capital Management, LLC (2017)  The defendants here did the exact same thing we KNOW Melvin, RH, and all those other guys did (I would actually argue the case is much more severe in our current situation) and the other guys almost got hit with a RICO but barely got out on jurisdictional technicality. That's all I have now but perhaps someone could look into it or expand on the research? I will definitely share as soon as I get more interesting information.  This is also a great link explaining Bear Raids (Univ. of Penn., 2008):    Positions: (100) GME @ 107; (100) BB @ 22 GAMESTOP TO THE MOON BOYS, HOLD THE LINE        Yours,  Anonymous Law Student Who Yolo'd 10k on GME     Edit: For some reason I can't see comments on my post but I can see them in my email notifications. To   . I'm sure after that happened they had to rebrand lol. I did not make that connection THEY"VE LITERALLY DONE THIS BEFORE! And yo other guy, no I didn't miss out on gains cuz I'M NOT FREAKIN' SELLING
On. Serious note: respect the decisions of deepfuckingvalue from here on out
As we all know, the most likely outcome has happened where regulators and boomers are now targeting anybody who looks like a convenient target.   Deepfuckingvalue, who was unfortunately outed, is increasingly looking like that person.   He is now in more danger than any of us. I doubt that anything will acruallly come of this, but now real heat is coming out, as tends to when traditional power dynamics are upset.   Not to mention; despite the fact that he was acting as a private individual and not actually acting in an official or financial position, the optics are being set up against him.   Do not attack him if he decides to withdraw all today. He has his own life and family to protect. He‚Äôs also much more vulnerable than anyone here, and he doesn‚Äôt have the polemical connections like citadel does. Not to mention he just screams boomer bait.   I suspect he‚Äôs feeling pressured into not selling because of the cult status he has here. But his own personal life comes first. Chances are, he may never be able to work in an official financial position again.   I‚Äôm not crying for his financial future or anything, he‚Äôs worth 8 figures. But again, he needs that money given his position. For the rest of his life he will be a political prop. Please respect his decisions and most importantly realize he‚Äôs a fucking human being with his own life  Edit: still holding I bought @30 in at $300 lol
SEC charges against Citadel and Robinhood!!!!!! Reasons we are here holding diamond hands.
This post is meant to help people understand what has been going on and present some of the past unethical actions of citadel and Robinhood in regards to market manipulation. This is a post to highlight some influences behind this movement that may be relevant for those not in the know. I hope this post is helpful to people feeling confused about the news.
Hedge funds monitoring WallStreetBets
‚ÄúHedge funds, investment bankers and other institutional investors are desperate to find the next GameStop -- before it's too late.  That's why Thinknum Alternative Data quickly built and launched a tool that provides its hedge fund and investment bank clients a ranking of the most-mentioned stocks on WallStreetBets as well as the Stocks subreddit.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe tool gives sophisticated investors a way to avoid getting their short positions blown up -- and the option to bet in tandem with retail investors. "The inbound inquiries from people asking about the dataset has been insane. I've never seen anything like it," Justin Zhen, Thinknum's co-founder and president, told CNN Business.‚Äù   Honestly, we should start mentiom some crazy shit stocks and fuck with their algorithm, so the next report they get is of some shitty company from butt fuck nowhere
to all the people who think GME naysayers are bots
you guzzled that kool-aid like ur wife guzzles her boyfriend's cum. if u want the perspective of proper WSB retards and not that of the fresh, even more retarded meat, go and peruse the profiles of parties involved in the GME posts months ago (could do it via deepfuckingvalue's account). And just as a general rule in life, look to the people who get in on things early and spoke accurately to the future in the past rather than just riding the waves of hysteria and groupthink that are shat out in the thick of it  btw any reasonable tard figured DFV was never selling  i have no positions in GME and no opinions on its fair valuation
AMC hold for life
I missed out on GME earlier but I bought into AMC and I‚Äôm holding for the long haul because AMC Stubs list was the shit! $25/month for 3 movies a week? Yes please! I have to do my part to keep the dream alive!
Warning about TD default setting on Calls
Had 2x sets of contracts deep in the red (30-40% under) last friday, and had written them off as just going to expire and I'm out that money.  TD instead waited until end of day and then exercised those calls so not only did I lose on the contracts value - I was prepared for that - but then it buys me a few thousand shares at the strike which is like $5 over current value on a $40 stock. So now I'm in two unintended positions and already down a third from the price they got me for.  Spent the last 3 days on the phone but nobody's answering over there so today pulled the trigger and started the transfer to Schwab.  Just a heads up.
This Video PROVES Market Manipulation
No one individual gets to set the price of a stock, a stock price is completely based on supply and demand. No one individual gets to say I can't buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares.   Think about it. There is a BIGGER question here. Something very fishy is going on.  Please share this as wide as possible. Brokerages have no right to tell us in a free market how much we can and cannot pay for a stock.  Failure to Delivers Since 2010:
GME Business discussion
Question about GME, how is it suppose to monetize from certain games Fortnite and Warzone when these types of games are free to play and also very popular. It‚Äôs what all the kids play these days. Just thought of this as a GME shareholder.  I guess you can‚Äôt really monetize off of these games ?  But it‚Äôs competitors can‚Äôt either ?    By the way here‚Äôs and article I read on the future of gaming industry as an investment theme.  Holding GME, but just food for thought
Just a noob with a thought...
Last note of the evening... I've met some dudes that hustle way harder than than hedge fund/stock portfolio advisors/analysts ... only difference is they dont have the education or knowlege to hit the market like some of us...  its rigged.   I say we educate everyone equally. Regardless of where you come from, what fraternity or corporate ties the family has, what color people see when the sun hits our skin, or where dad or mom went to school. Let's even the playing field. I'd take a street hustler against a wall street sheet trader any day of the week. I dunno if this is a step in how we can break racial inequality on a big stage. It'll probably never happen, it is rigged. But, ...  Hustlers gotta provide for their family. Brokers/analyst/traders just need to balloon that account on the screen. You put two intellectuals against one another with nothing to lose and let's see who comes out on top... An intellectual with a covered future, or and intellectual who's gotta provide to stay alive to see the future.   My $ is on the fellow who's not covered going forward, regardless of what pigmentation your skin is.  One ‚ù§
An actual question
I am trying t understand something.  If 100's of thousands, if not millions of people, can all give there money to one hedge fund to use as a heavy weight and move markets.  How is that any different then the allegations being throw around here?
DD: $NOK, Positive Earnings Report, Possible Earnings Play?
Here's the link to the report!  Do your DD when you makes your plays tomorrow!  Just giving others hope when not all hope is lost!  The  stock market has other stocks to make plays.  Obviously I'm still holding my GME and AMC.  I'm not a financial advisor. THIS IS NOT ADVICE  TARDS. Just wanna figure out what tendies are.....  EDIT: Cause I don't proofread then I do and I realize I'm actually autistic.....  Edit #2: Added more links!
Knew From The Beginning Everyone Would Sell
I told everyone that I knew not to waste their time buying GameStop as all those people pretending that they "liked the stock" would sell and the stock would never hit $1000. Now the suckers that bought high have lost everything and the scammers that raised the stock to $300 cleaned up on those suckers investments.
To Robin' the hood apologists. Here is why your position is BS
When RH started restricting people from buying GME and other stocks they said that it was a liquidity issue:  >Robinhood said last week their clearinghouse-mandated deposit requirements related to equities "increased ten-fold"      To the uninformed and to those paid to ignore it, it makes sense. However, those of us with a bit of memory, this is BS. It is Bs because one of RH's strategies was supposed to be getting rid of middlemen. In 2018 they were gloating about having built their own clearing house:        https://robinhood.engineering/under-the-hood-of-clearing-by-robinhood-3ed7ab09d60  Why does RH need to have such big collateral cash for their clearing houses, if they are the clearing house? it is like Kirkland asking Costco for a cash advance in order to fulfill toilet paper orders.
I'm not going to tell you to hold or sell, but I will tell you to do your research.
Please just do some deep diving into why GME is a good stock to hold. I know most of you saw some WSB posts show up in r/all, and thought you could get in while the iron was hot.   Newsflash: Most of the people you know use Reddit, and they weren't dumb enough to put money into it after it had already increased $300 in two weeks.   Newsflash #2: You were dumb enough. That's fine, as long as you have real reasons to back up your actions.   Instead of spamming the daily chat with super unique phrases like "Here we go!!!" or "GUH" please just put some time into researching this stock. Not only will you learn something, you will be able to explain why you did something so retarded.   The smart people in this sub care about you. We don't want to see you lose hundreds/thousands of dollars. Holding works for the people who can afford it. If you can't afford it, then you better learn about this situation and be able to back up your actions.
"Not a loss until you sell" applies most of the time but ALWAYS depends on the stock
I've been on this subreddit since 2017 and only started posting during this GME runup given the amount of hype that GME was getting.  I feel like I need to say something so people don't $ROPE thinking they have no other choice but to pray for a squeeze.  I need people to understand that not selling (depending on the stock) is also losing because of OPPURTUNITY COST. I am not telling you to sell if this was fun money for you, but I see people taking out fucking loans to play a momentum run that prior to this only ranged between $3-$25 per share for the last 4 years.   Yes I understand Cohen can make changes to make GME a successful businesses, but understand it can take years. If you bought at 300-500 you will basically NEED a short squeeze to get out of those positions.  If your paper loss is already -75%, than ya, probably just hold, but do what is best for YOU.  The heavy realized loss that I took from my last GME trade hurt a lot, but I took my remaining capital and made a good chunk of my loss back up already (BA and MSFT). Sometimes you need to be proactive and not wait/pray for a short squeeze to happen.   For example: If I have a position in AAPL and for whatever reason it drops 30%, I wont sell it since I know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of AAPL's FUNDAMENTALS.   People need to understand that GME was a high risk high reward play. If you believe that this stock was manipulated, then what makes you think they will stop now? If you are confident in your position then hold.  I pray that a short squeeze does happen since I sympathize with people that lost their fucking life savings on this play, but at the end of the day you need to do what is best for YOU.
SHOULD WSB GET A REP AT THE GME BOARD? WE NOW OWN >5% OF SHARES FOR SURE
It seems we have bought quite a lot of shares to appoint our own rep to the board  Guys with some good trading software could you check how much is in retail hands,
Help out a fellow retard? MARGIN VS CASH question? ü§öüèª
I have seen a lot about buying on margin... I use Webull to trade and have a margin account... does that mean I automatically bought on margin. Idk. I believe in the stock but eat crayons.. so a little help?
Democrats vow to legalize cannabis this year
Wake up retards.  Enough talking about GME.   If dfv is out you should all be out. The only people left in GME are our new retarded friends who we picked up last week.   Welcome to all 7million of you morons, Now try not to baghold the meme stocks all the way back to 0.   If your account has been severely damaged cause youre a goof and you would like to regain some of your account back ... buy MSOS right meoww ;)
The people on "our side" telling you it's OK to quit?
A few weeks in and people can't eat? It's just been the beginning of the month and people are complaining aobut having to pay next months rent? Really? Just selling 1 will cover you!  Don't let the BS apologists tell you it's OK to get out. These guys have just shorted you and are laughing at you. They are giving you an excuse to headshot yourself. We knew that fighting the long fight would mean holding our breath as well as the stock. It's the long fight.  We are holding. Diamondhands!  GME is coming up with real change because of us. I like the stock. I like the people who like the stock. To the moon!
GME is now a regular long term stock investment. We just need to admit it.
I bought into the hype too. I originally bought at $42. I currently stand at 690 shares @ $127 average. I believe in this community. I believe in the movement.      But we have to accept that with the RH move, it was checkmate. Not only did they stop the short squeeze, but they were also able to short more stock at the peak and drive it down to $100. They didn't lose. We did. And that's OK. We bet, we lost.      Now, we all need to step back and decide if GME is a company we want to invest in. If we still believe in it. It's an entirely different game and an entirely different bet. Look at GME the last few days. It's trading normally. No more swings, no more severe volatility. It's business as usual.      Disclaimer: This is not financial advise. I'm just an idiot who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on this.
Any help getting some cracks in my smooth brain??
I‚Äôve learnt a lot over the last week with GME. I‚Äôd like to learn more. Specifically in options trading. Can the smart apes please point this smooth brained one in the right direction? I‚Äôve been searching the sub and lots of general advice but I‚Äôd love some books or courses or something of more substance.   Thanks for any help....
What app should I use
I really wanna start investing but was unable to get into my robinhood account due to an old phone number and the fact that their customer support sucks. Anyone have any other stock trade apps they recommend?
GIVE THEM NOTHING!!! BUT TAKE FROM THEM, EVERYTHING!!!
This is for everyone holding GME/AMC.  The fact that you are stilling holding proves you have diamond hands.   You trust the stock will rise and will be rewarded when it does. You're standing strong with your other ape brothers. The weak paper hands people are out, they got scared of a little red.   STAY STRONG, think of all the tendies and nintendo's you can buy with your earnings.  I'm not a financial advisor, so don't take my advise, expecting to make money. As far as you know I'm a monkey at a computer, but I'm a monkey who LIKES THE STOCK!!!  Edit: My first awards ever thank you üêµ
I don‚Äôt know why every one is worried about the SEC investigating. Peter Strzoks wife runs the SEC.
The Strzok family will do any thing (and I mean any thing) in their power to protect America‚Äôs citizens from Russian infiltration including into this sub.
Genuinely curious for some answers on this:
EDIT: Can y‚Äôall PM me answers I can‚Äôt read the comments... :(  So, if the valuation is $30, why is it still at $100 even after all the buying restrictions? Why wasn‚Äôt it just a pump to 400, instead of that being the low number the squeeze went to compared to what was predicted on over 100% shorts.   Why was $400 the peak of the ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù and not the price because of the  viral  interest it had and a basement level ease of entry at $1 for a fractional share... before they restricted us from buying to really start the gamma squeeze?  Why are people saying that it can‚Äôt go up when we haven‚Äôt seen the data about the actual percentage of short positions we want to see that‚Äôs being released on the 9th? Why not hold until then at least so we know the whole story before selling?  Stocks go up and down, and if we‚Äôre still pushing the $100 mark after all that we went up against so far, who‚Äôs to say we can‚Äôt keep up the pressure and keep the price there? And even if it dips lower, people can take the income tax reduction or buy more at the lower price and average out eventually, and there‚Äôs good prospects for its future with its new leadership team I think. It‚Äôll eventually go up in price, most of these people are millennials and will be alive when the price of every stock is 10x higher in general anyway in 2050 or whatever if they just hold... Heck, I‚Äôve rode other stocks and stuff through worse swings than this, I‚Äôm young and believe that everything‚Äôs gonna inflate in value after this whole ‚Äúmillennial trading hype‚Äù becomes the norm amongst people with smartphones and access to fractional shares.  Also, what‚Äôs to stop them from allowing this new influx of excited people who are catching on running it up to 500 or whatever and them going, ‚Äúlook, the squeeze happened!‚Äù, when it‚Äôs just a pump in price? And then people miss out on the real squeeze? I say just hold regardless.  That‚Äôs just what I believe. But I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and don‚Äôt suggest anyone trade based off my comments. I just believe in GameStop  üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I can‚Äôt get a straight forward answer to this in the comments because the comments are a mess. Making a thread in case this stays up and I can read the replies because I couldn‚Äôt on my last thread...
Why are more people not talking about the fact that $GME literally closed at $  exactly?? This has to be a message from a üê≥on our side.
Shit doesn‚Äôt just close at such a specific number like that. Can we get a discussion going on this? I‚Äôve heard a few people saying that the number 88 symbolizes wealth. Does this mean we have a whale on our side who is sending us a message that tomorrow is the day?

Can we agree that Fidelity‚Äôs App is hot garbage
Hello fellow autists  . I come before you today to enlist your help in submitting a formal request to Fidelity to fix that God awful thing they call an app.   After last week‚Äôs obvious attempt to thwart retail investors I decided to take my talents to Fidelity, and by talents I mean net loss portfolio. By the way, dont be me. While transferring your portfolio your stocks are frozen so you lose the ability to sell your stocks. So if GME and AMC had skyrocketed to 1,000,000,000 and then quickly shot back down to $  during the transfer, I literally wouldve had to say GG. The squeeze would have been squoze ladies and ladies. Dont. Do. What. I. Did. Just wait for this all to be over then bounce they way GME will bounce then head for the moon.  Anyway, now that i‚Äôm on Fidelity, im happy to be on a platform that actually looks out for the little guy and doesnt mind the poor steal from the rich but jesus christ is this user interface GARBAGE. To check your positions and watchlist you have to engage with a Microsoft Excel-like sliding page which is a pain. You also have to change your account setting (see    But seriously until the app gets a makeover i‚Äôll probably end up using Robinhood just to look at charts and Fidelity to enter. I know it‚Äôs a pain in the ass but i‚Äôm hardheaded and wanna feeling like im sticking it to ‚Äúthe man‚Äù.  So again, I ask that as a unit we make something shake and actually get Fidelity to make their app more user friendly for us retarded folk.   TLDR: me no likey app.
Losses are tax-deductible.
I thought that it was important for you new investors to know this.  Some of you have immense losses, and it may help you to know that you can write these losses off your taxes.
Technically I am a financial advisor
I‚Äôm not going to give you advice though.   Personally I own 8 shares of GME at 270. I can‚Äôt get out even if I wanted to, now. My only option is to hold until earnings and some type of action from cohen. Shorts will likely exit at some point but you know my money is going to be tied up for a while. I might buy some more in this huge dip to lower my average cost.   In any case I don‚Äôt bet what I can‚Äôt lose. But unless GME goes to 0, odds are I won‚Äôt lose. Some day I may paper hands. But not now.   TLDR I‚Äôm going to hold and buy dips.
Can this be the moment of momentum?
Yesterday was not so bad ($1 up closing woop!) and we fought back.  Can we just start a fresh and say that today is the day... THE DAY, we strap in our balls n boobs in first class to our future?!  Ignore all the negativity and endless noise out there and decide our future.   It‚Äôs now or never my autistic ape friends..
What happened?
You Fuking idiots remember when you played RuneScape and Somone said doubling gp or trimming armor and you trusted that guy and you swore he‚Äôd give it back? That‚Äôs what gme did to you idiot Adults! Things happen in the stock market all the Fuking time and you hopped in because GameStop meant something to you and all these things created nostalgia and trust! You need to accept you‚Äôve missed the ride and your diamond hands are melting away. I‚Äôm sorry it happens and it‚Äôs the media‚Äôs fault for making this to Public. Rip little ol wsb rip durial321
LETS CRUSH THE SHORTS $XL IS NEXT BOYS
72% short interest. 3/30 earnings report.  Based on the value of orders going as far as 2024, the stock should really be worth more around 35 in my opinion.   I have a 3/19   strike call and might buy a 5/21 $25 strike call.
The game plan hasn‚Äôt changed.
I have no fucking idea what I‚Äôm talking about and this is certainly not financial advice.  What‚Äôs changed in the plan, exactly?!? We buy and hold with our diamond hands and we will reach the fucking moon together!!!  I love all of you and will see you all in outer space! #ExcessiveRocketBitmojis
FOR DIAMOND HANDS ONLY
This is how I think of it for all of you who are low on moral  THIS THING COULD GO TO .30 CENTS AND ID STILL BE HOLDING. SO WHAT IF I BOUGHT AT THE PEAK OF 350?!?!? SO WHAT IF I SPENT HALF OF MY PORTFOLIO ON THIS?!?! SO WHAT IF IM RETARDED?!?! AS LONG AS I HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MY BOIS IN THE WSB I KNOW DEEP DOWN IN MY HEART THAT THEY WILL COME BACK FOR ME. I KNOW THEY WILL AND FOR THE REST OF US WHO ARE ALSO STUCK UP HERE AT THE PEAK OF MT. EVEREST I KNOW THEY WILL COME FOR US TOO. ALL IN DUE TIME I SAY!!! ALL IN DUE TIME!!! THE PRICE IS LOW WHICH IS A PERFECT TIM EFOR US TO RESTOCK ON AMMO AND BUY OF THE REST OF THE MARKET AND GET US CLOSER TO GETTING THAT VW SPIKE BACK IN 08. SO I SAY TO YOU ALL DIAMOND HANDS      DIAMOND HANDS I SAY! LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE WITH ME AND RAISE YOUR DIAMOND HANDS     Sincerely,  Rain
Can the hedge funds do more shady shit?
Hi, holding til the moon, but I'm a dumb fucking idiot and I have no idea what shady shit Melvin is cooking up right now, so I was wondering if anybody had insight into a few questions.  1. If they purchased the shorts as part of Melvin, can the company just declare bankruptcy and default on their payments/requirement to pay back their shares? 2. Is anybody else concerned that they're just buying time to store all their money offshore in some safe account right now and then will just default on their shorts (again I don't know if this is even possible).  3. I've heard rumors that they may have created fake shares (I won't even pretend to know how they do that), but what happens with those fake share?  Plz, me simple ape, looking for answers
hard Sell: Robinhood Must Require Citadel to Sell Its Stake
There seems to me to be only a single path forward for the company that wasn't ready be a big boy broker when its customers were in a historic trade. Robinhood must issue a public request asking Citadel LLC to sell its stake in the trading app to other existing investors.  Curious to get your take. Do you agree with me?  The only justification for keep Citadel LLC on the cap table is that it ensures Robinhood always has access to a market maker in Citadel Securities, but there are others on the market. I'm just not sure if people they are the same shitty, less shitty, or more shitty.       Edit for clarity:   Citadel LLC, Griffin's Hedge Fund, is rumored to also be an   equity investor   in Robinhood. While this may not be accurate, OP finds it hard to believe that his interests and those of some of the investors in Robinhood are not somehow contradictory to the interests of Robinhood users. Michael Rockefeller was an employee of Citadel for fucks sake. The firm is the breeding ground for .0001% and they are all connected. I moved this edit down because it grew to be long.
Research, do your DD, polish that üß†
We're gonna need more than    because I'm afraid the fresh retards will have   fucking üß†  This is in no way financial advice. I like the stock. I'm fucking holding 20@320.  DON'T LET THEM GET TO YOUR BRAIN AND GO FUCK YOURSELVES!
It's always the small guys that get framed ?
As the GameStop, Amc arc is heading towards a closure, the big institutions & SEC are looking for someone to blame. They can't blame or frame their supporters or backers.  Then, who's it gonna be? Ofc , the small, retail investors. They will create a new word, frame new market logic and sell it as mass market manipulation.  Like the HFT which eventually lead to Flash Crash, SEC labelled word spoofing, by that means all those that did spoofing using HFT were culprits. But only Navinder Singh got framed.  What are your thoughts? Correct me if I'm wrong.
We stopped a company from going bankrupt.
Not sure what will happen to GME. I hope for the best because you guys really deserve it. I only hold 2 shares but that only came about from the passion I saw on here in wanting to stick it to Wall Street. Each and everyday I read something that just shows how blatantly corrupt these hedge funds and news networks are, and yet we‚Äôre the bad guys. We‚Äôre the idiots, the losers who risked it all to take on the big guys and failed. But I‚Äôm proud nonetheless.   I am in no saying that I think this is over yet. But just remember that our (individual and in no corroborated) actions helped a company avoid bankruptcy. We stopped a company that was being condemned to death. I don‚Äôt know what GameStop could be doing right now, but they‚Äôre idiots if they‚Äôre not using this rise in popularity to raise capital or begin the move to online commerce. That‚Äôs at least how I see it. That‚Äôs how this movie ends.   For now.
Gather evidence...
Just a friendly reminder to screenshot and screen record all of your trades you make on GME, AMC, and the others that we‚Äôve had problems with in the past going forward. If shady shit happens, it‚Äôs always nice to have evidence of it happening in real time.
Help downunder.
What trading app would you diamond hand, rocket riding retards recommend for an Australian trying to make some bets?  Looking to buy and hold, but +500 doesn‚Äôt list GME for one, and Robinhood not available in region.
3 year old account name makes sense today!
I Made this account 3 years ago, I had no idea about trading, investing, WSB or anything. I have no clue what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm learning more and more every day so this is my sign. Wealthsimple put a 3 day hold on my funds and I will buy buying AMC and GME tomorrow and idgaf if it goes all the way down (it fucking won‚Äôt) I will HOLD despite this bullshit going on. I‚Äôve never had an account with the name diamond in it. I‚Äôm going in with the money I can risk. Diamondpupper is going to have diamond hands idgaf what the bots say. Idgaf what the      have to fucking say. I‚Äôm a retard.     all the way GME, AMC, BB, NOK       idgaf, fuck the bots and fuck the   ü§ö I‚Äôll ride it into the dirt. I‚Äôd rather lose my investment now than miss out on the long term opportunity. Who‚Äôs with me. Fellow retard smooth üß†  UNITE AND FUCKING HOLD.
Simple explanation of why I‚Äôm still holding 530 shares of GME
I just join WSB last week and I‚Äôm happy to be with you retards on this journey. As a fellow retard I‚Äôm not well versed the mechanical jargon of wall street. I know enough to understand what is going on, but I‚Äôve always stayed away from shorting, margin, or options. So honestly, my smooth ape brain hurts reading about short ladder attacks, ITM/OTM contracts, and naked shorts. I‚Äôm sure the 6 million new subscribers feel the same way. So I‚Äôm going to break down in super simple terms why I‚Äôm still holding the stock.  First though, it‚Äôs important to face reality. This movement to take on the hedge funds has died down. WSB was getting over 1 million new subscribers per day and now it‚Äôs only gaining maybe 100,000 subscribers. The google trend data for GME stock shows significantly less traffic.         Also, a ton of paper handed fucks sold their positions and gave billions back to the hedge funds.   Since there are less people joining and at lot of people who have sold out of GME, there is a significantly less of a forced short squeeze. BUT IM STILL NOT SELLING. WHY? I‚Äôll break it down with super simple math that even an ape can do.  According to Yahoo Finance there are 47 million shares in the public float. Meaning shares available for the public to trade.            There are   million subscribers on WSB. If each subscriber held an average of   shares, WSB would control the entire float! If the entire float was owned by WSB, then WSB would literally control the price of the stock.   Yes, I know that not all   million subscribers are going to buy GME. And even if WSB did, a lot of retards have paper hands and would sell early. Also, many subscribers are just here to enjoy the show or are bots.   But let‚Äôs pretend that just 25% have diamond hands and buy GME. That would mean there would be   million people buying the stock. If 25% each bought an average of 22 shares, WSB would control the entire float.     million x 22 =   million  This is definitely possible, although not probable given the recent developments. However, the risk vs reward is still very lucrative.  I created a probability table and assigned a probability of GME hitting certain prices.         According to my table, I estimate that the probability that GME will go to $75 or less at 73%. However, in the event that WSB controls the shares of GME, the price would skyrocket. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the short interest is at 100%, 50%, or 25%, there will be shorts that need to cover and there will be no supply.   I believe I‚Äôm being very conservative with my estimates on the upside. I assign a 27% chance that the price of the stock would go to $150 or more. Out of the 27%, I only give a 1% chance that the price will go to 2000.   If you take all of the prices and assign a probability to each price, you get a weighted average price of $182  Given the current price of $89 that would represent a 104% return.   To be clear, I am in no way telling WSB to buy GME in order to gain control of the price. I‚Äôm just saying, if WSB happens to control it, the upside will be significant if one were to get in at this price, but what do I know. I‚Äôm just a monkey, ape, retard, idiot, autist, blah blah blah.   Position:  530 GME @$98
We need to buy Luby‚Äôs
Luby‚Äôs cafeteria is a te was based chain restaurant that has been decimated by hedge funds and Covid. They intend to short the stock to destroy the company. We need to buy as much as possible. Returns are infinite.
DONT BUY INTO THE PANIC. HOLD THE LINE
Fellow Autists and Retards we can win and here's why  I‚Äôm going to try and keep this as straightforward as possible as I‚Äôve been seeing tons of posts with complicated shit that I can‚Äôt read and that. I also think we are complicating this situation more than we need to.    I don‚Äôt need to understand every detail about the situation to understand when my enemy is weak and beat down.   The media has been trying to push the narrative that the shorts have been covered and we have lost; however, I can hardly see how this could be possible. Again, I‚Äôm not sure how this all works in terms of details but what I do know is that   this is an unprecedented event.   Everyone over the course of the past weeks has been claiming that this was going to be the biggest squeeze ever and would alter the financial landscape. Despite this I have yet to see it come true.    GME was shorted something like \~140% a few weeks ago, but I simply cannot believe that the hedgie scumbags would‚Äôve taken a substantial loss and covered their shorts at any point last week, it was simply too expensive and the volume wasn‚Äôt there  . Although one of you is probably typing some complicated ass essay about how they could‚Äôve covered their shorts I‚Äôm going to ask a simple question.   Why would these hedgie scums be investing time and money to short ladder attack GME today, especially since they‚Äôre claiming they‚Äôve covered? THIS DOESN‚ÄôT MAKE SENSE AT ALL.    Now I could be wrong, but to me,   this seems like the bully on the playground  . We as retards cannot read the minds of the hedge funds nor do we understand their sorcery. What we do know is     MF  . What I‚Äôm trying to say is that the playground bully aka the hedge funds are assholes and trying to push us around and convince us that we‚Äôve lost through ladder attacks, spreading claims of covering, and manipulating the markets. BUT what we must remember bullies act for a reason   whether it‚Äôs a shitty home situation, your wife not getting piped down by her boyfriend or   not covering your shorts.   I‚Äôm convinced they havent covered their shorts and today the only people selling are üìù     betas.    Retards we have not lost. Our enemy is trying to scare us. We‚Äôve been saying it for days. They‚Äôve been doing all the dirty tricks, and I know we always say we will HOLD, but seriously if   WE HOLD THEY HAVE TO COVER AT SOME POINT.    LOOK PAST THE BULLY ON THE PLAYGROUND POINT OUT HIS FLAWS.   THEY ARE FUCKING WITH US AND THIS IS THE FIRST TEST OF MANY. THEY HAVEN‚ÄôT COVERED SHIT.   Look at the damage we have caused so far, look how they're counting us out.   Show them how retarded we can be and HOLD THIS SHIT.    Look at the retard commenting above you and below you. They‚Äôre holding and you better be too. Don‚Äôt let them down. We like this stock, the stock is great. TOGETHER WE CAN WIN. But only together. Cuban was right, we need to show them strength in numbers.   Why would a billionaire side with a bunch of retards if he didn‚Äôt know we had something going, something special?    Now look, many of you sold today, and I get it. It‚Äôs hard when you have to look at the red and see your money drop. But what about the spaceship. The spaceship never broke down, it was broken and flawed since the beginning, but we found how to fix it.   Get back on the ride together and lets soar, beyond the moon.     Robinhood upped the amount you can buy.   Now‚Äôs a great chance to get in on this great stock because it‚Äôs only going up and it‚Äôs cheap for what it will be worth in the future.    HOLD. THE. FUCKING. LINE. BUY. THE. DIP    I bought 4 shares @ $335 and for a broke college student like me its quite a bit. And I know it‚Äôs not much compared to DFV, and many others but if we all can see the strength in numbers each share is worth so much more.       TL:DR: They haven‚Äôt covered shit. We are not losing, and we can still win. But only if we work together and hold.       edit: Was going to try and update shares but so many comments keep getting deleted. SHOULDNT MATTER THO CUZ WE ALL BUYING TMRW.               disclaimer: I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, and I'm most definitely not a financial advisor.
All u idiots are falling for it ü§°ü§°ü§°üò≥     paper hands
Hedgefunds have played you paper hands like a fiddle using their multiple double helix inverse short ladders with hardwood rungs and metal furnishings. They also used the classic hedge fund manipulation trick of sec fillings       . You see that 2% today, that's the run-up to 10k$ and your all about to be left behind         ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°  Diamond hands          we like this stock apes strong together.  No I'm not trying to get you to buy this stock so I can offload these bags were gonna stick it the HF's trust me bro.
Close your account with robinhood.
The amount of accounts open is a huge impact on what investors look at be it public or private are looking for. Look at wells fargo history.   I'm not sure if it's bots or what, but close that fucking robinhood account.   I am retarded and new to the sub but still.  Edit: if you can still see this somehow, something fucked up is happening where I can see comments due to email notifications and reddit sync but they aren't showing up as far as I can tell. This shit is fucked up so everyone take care  Edit 2: I posted this in the new wall street bets test sub and it immediately got deleted so take that as you will, but something seems fucky over there too? Fuck dudes. This is getting insane.
Reminder that $RTRD is available
If anyone decides to make an ETF for this subreddit containing shorted ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stocks, let me know. $RTRD and $WSBT is available and if he willing to pay upwards of 1% a year in fees if it‚Äôs actively managed.   First one of you retards to accomplish this is going to be one wealthy ape ü¶ß
I get we seen red for a while now but take care of yourself
Been in since GME was at $10 so for quiet a while. With that said, take care of yourselves, mental health is very important. Figure out your exit strategies, and if you‚Äôre    üèª holding this, don‚Äôt even look at the stock. I know it will be hard at first, but trust me seeing constant red is gonna make it even worse. The short squeeze won‚Äôt happen tomorrow or after tomorrow. Strap in, don‚Äôt look at the stock and get it together. GME TO THE MOON
Request for DD on actually liking the stock $GME
This is all new to me. My husband and my boyfriend are a finance dude, but many of the questions I‚Äôve asked have stretched their knowledge on the matter. Especially on this stock which has more to do with psychological warfare than with the F-word (fundamentals). After today and the announcements from GameStop it got me wondering...    First, I know that at some point, Game Stop repurchased a bunch of their own shares. They knew something before most did, and that was that they were putting some real money and effort behind  up their image and offering. I heard they closed down locations, did a sale/lease deal with their warehouse locations, and even sold off the firm‚Äôs jet, just in order to buy more of their own stock.    So they‚Äôre invested, just like we are, into the price of this stock. I believe that, because they‚Äôre invested like us, they‚Äôre likely to work on a strategy that would be beneficial to all of us as well. I know we can‚Äôt compare ourselves to the VW squeeze- we lack the element of surprise and an instant lack of stocks to purchase the same way they did. However... what are the mechanics of if some other company came in and announced that they were/had bought in to GME? Could they have done this already without our knowing? What would they have to do if they wanted to? Just seems like a decent play and I‚Äôm trying to learn more about how this shit works. What other possible plays could GameStop make which would be good for them but also good for us?    Do other hedge funds have a benefit if they were to disclose their positions? If this is a war of ownership it just seems like it would be beneficial to all parties involved and bought-in to disclose positions, so that we look like a united front. Combine that with some other large buy from an interested party and that could be huge, right?    After hearing about the possibility of a streaming service to compete with Twitch, I became interested in actually going long with GME. Even at $325. Not only that, but I feel like GameStop will go forward with the feeling of ‚Äúwe need to justify all the faith put into us.‚Äù I can‚Äôt imagine another company that would feel as much obliged to the approval of their share holders than GameStop. Can you imagine the necessity to deliver that board must feel?? They ought to.    Just thoughts from a baby ape. It‚Äôs been fun getting involved with the sub I‚Äôm constantly hearing my boyfriend and husband talk about when they‚Äôre jerking each other off. Thanks for humoring an annoying noob. At the very least, I‚Äôll always know that I‚Äôm not a fucking paper hands bitch. FTR, in the week since I‚Äôve put $25k into GME, I‚Äôve gotten another $  in payments in real life. There are real life lessons to be learned from not being a paper hands bitch. I‚Äôm a better, ballsier businesswoman after this week. I love hanging out with you fucking retards and I‚Äôm looking forward to posting many future loss/gain porns which will be completely unrelated to GME. üíú      Edit: WTF is going on with the sub? I‚Äôm getting emails about comments which are not showing up.
The difference between a retard and a fan
I am not a financial adviser, this is only a retard opinion:  I went from cheering you guys on to becoming a retard. Now I could shit through the eye of a needle, or not at all.  The difference is that I ABSOLUTELY knew in my heart that holding would bring the bacon home as an observer/fan. Now I see the seed of doubt as a retard - even though I wrote off my investment from the get-go.  Don't let that seed be fed. Don't allow the status quo to return. $GME can now compete and overshadow STEAM etc. We like it but we also believe in it!  Thanks to you flush guys and gals for the billboards!     Edit: thanks for the update on wsb compromised. reposted in wsbt
Nokia Q4 Earning Report just released.
The whole report can be seen  .  Here are the key points mentioned in the report. I will follow up with important things that I personally took note of. Overall, Nokia absolutely kicked ass in 2020 considering the economic implications of COVID, and projections for 2021 and beyond look good.    Nokia Corporation Financial Report for Q4 and Full Year 2020      Solid margin performance driven by customer demand in North America      5% year-on-year decrease in reported net sales in Q4, primarily due to Mobile Access, as declines in network deployment and planning services were partially offset by growth in radio access products   1% growth in constant currency net sales in Q4   Continued improvements in our Mobile Access portfolio; strengthening roadmaps, reducing product costs and improving product performance; commitment to invest in R&D to drive product leadership   Increase in Mobile Access gross margin in Q4, primarily driven by improved 5G gross margin, partially offset by a project-related loss provision   Positive operating profit, on a reported basis, in Q4 and full year 2020   Non-IFRS operating profit in Q4 benefited by approximately EUR 250 million, due to the timing of revenue recognition and a net positive fluctuation in Nokia‚Äôs venture fund investments   Strong free cash flow in Q4 and full year 2020 benefited from an early customer payment of approximately EUR   billion, which was expected in Q1 2021   Derecognized EUR   billion of Finnish deferred tax assets, which are not lost   Reiterated outlook for 2021 comparable operating margin of 7-10% and provided new outlook for net sales and free cash flow   Board does not propose a dividend or dividend authorization for the financial year 2020  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  My personal notes -    Nokia kicked ass in 2020. Keep in mind that the Corona economy heavily impacted many companies this year, and infrastructure/5G development for Nokia was generally slowed down YoY; yet Nokia still met Operating Margin targets as well as growing the reach of the business overall.   Nokia met their Operating Margin target of 7%-10% at a solid     Nokia has successfully maintained and is now operating a completely independent international supply chain with 25 locations.   Nokia has projected a Net Sales growth in 2021 as demand for 5G infrastructure will continue to grow.   Though net sales are down, the reduction in sales is being offset by increased demand for 5G products and infrastructure.   There were ‚Ç¨200MM revenue that has been delayed (not lost) as a result of COVID.   Nokia expects to take advantage of ‚Ç¨150MM in benefits from COVID in 2021.   Nokia management is NOT issuing a dividend this year in order to stimulate better growth and retain higher Free Cash Flow.   They project net positive growth in 2021, and would like to instate a dividend for 2021.     YoY EPS increase.   QoQ EPS decrease. Nokia has stated that this is likely a result of ‚Ç¨  Billion deferred taxes being unrecognized.   3rd Quarter in a row with increase in Free Cash Flow.   2020 ended with ‚Ç¨  Billion in Free Cash Flow.
Questions regarding GME
Hey WSB,  I had a few questions regarding GME. Now, I'm no paper-handed bitch, but did want to open a discussion up as to a few things that have been on my mind.  1. Assuming short ladder attacks exist, what's stopping the hedge funds from just continuing to do it til we reach 0?  2. What's the point of the hedge funds doubling down on their shorts if they don't think it'll go down more? Wouldn't this actually be a BAD sign for us retail investors (gamblers, retards, apes, whatever you wanna call it)  3. How come the short squeeze (assuming it still happens) would increment the price like it did with VW? Why can't the shorts just cover their positions slowly over time?  4. How long do we realistically have to hold GME in order for a short squeeze to actually happen? I know everyone here's always saying "oh they're paying a shit ton of interest per day, they HAVE to cover soon". Isn't that interest rate smaller than actually paying for shares upwards of $42069 (obviously a meme number, more realistically, I'm assuming if the squeeze is to be squoze, we'd reach $1000, maybe upwards of $2000. I can't see it being much more without some HF tricks being pulled in order to prevent it from going up that high).  Mind you, I'd love to be bullish, and worst case scenario this is a year long+ hold for me, I believe Ryan Cohen definitely will be able to actually bring GameStop to a much larger market cap, and this is a much more, imo, lucrative sector than pet food/toys/whatever else. I'm sure he'll be able to expand into the tech sector as well, with Matt Francis being the new Chief Technology Officer, definitely looks like he'll be able to bring together a decent team of engineers (if you're reading this, I'm looking for a Software Engineering Internship for this summer or if any of you redditors have connections lmk...)  Positions: gme: 130 shares @ 220 & 5k in leap calls   amc: 600 shares @ 8 2k in leap calls  EDIT: Ok what the hell, there actually is a shit ton of bots. GME
Serious Question about S3 short interest data
Let me start by saying I am not a paper handed bitch and will be holding my 10 GME shares @$128 till im both retarded AND dead.   I am idiot and 5 beers deep but I have seen several posts from people saying that S3 had recently changed their short % float formula to hide things.   They are referencing traditional SI % float figures and the new ‚ÄúS3 SI% float‚Äù figures, saying this S3 SI figure is a new or recently changed formula. But I‚Äôm looking at tweets from S3 as far back as October here where they have been mentioning the S3 SI% float this whole time based on what I‚Äôm seeing.      Am I too retarded to understand this or have people been lying about the formula changing? I‚Äôm still holding either way just trying to get to the bottom of this fuck
Covid took my gpa at the end of last year, so I poured a little cash on the YOLO bonfire for my homie. Miss you, old dude. (1933-2020)    üèª üòá
Title says it all. Feels good to do immortalize him on my portfolio. I‚Äôll never sell this shit. My smooth brains says it helps to not close a long if you‚Äôre waiting on CLA tendies, anyway.  I mean, I personally just like the stock. I bought a game there once in 2004 and they made me pay to return it. I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs not a $100,000/shr company by now.      Edit: Really appreciate the comments and wish I could reply to each, but the post was compromised by the hold-hate bots and none are visible. Thank you for your condolences. Keep on keepin on, my dudes and dudets.
S3 partners short interest miscalculation argument
Check out u/nov81 and his post on the S3 short interest numbers before reading. Typing on mobile so excuse shitty formatting.  Essentially, the argument is that there is an old and new short interest calculation used by S3 partners which is true. I decided to look a little deeper into this an actually verify what he was saying.   These are the two equations as per S3 partners founders Twitter:  Old - SI = shares_short / float  New - SI = shares_short / (float + shares_short)  The new equation, by adding the numerator to the base, creates a asymptote in which means it is impossible to touch 100% short interest and as a result is impossible to go above. No real issue here.   u/nov81 claims however, that the reason for the sudden drop in share short is that whatever analyst at S3 decided to take the short interest calculated from the new equation, then use that to find # shares short from the old equation.   This makes sense because because algebra would tell you that you cannot solve for two unknowns in an equation as simple as this, no cube roots or quadratics or whatever. This means that when we try and calculate shares short using the new equation, we get this;   shares_short = SI   (float + shares_short)   We cannot rearrange for shares_short using valid algebra. You could spend hours trying to, but it‚Äôs not possible. This here shows that in trying to calculate shares_short we need the shares_short variable, which is already unknown. You get the idea. His idea is that with this, an analyst then went onto use the old equation to recalculate the shares short.   shares_short = SI   float  The issue with this, is if we substitute SI for the new equation, we get this:  shares_short = (shares_short/(float + shares short))   float   You see the issue? There is no way to calculate shares_short without knowing short interest, and the short interest cannot be calculated without knowing shares_short. Neither calculation is feasible, the logic is flawed.   The day in which these shorts were covered was the day we saw the second peak in price. Most of this peak was in post market in which institutional investors have full right to buy and sell shares, and institutional investors are the one covering the shares.   Not only this, but u/nov81 needs to explain why Ortex also showed a drop of the same size shares short? I could have easily fucked up this math and an open to anyone correcting me, but even so there is no explanation for ortex.   Regardless, there are STILL 26M shares sold short. When we covered 26M shares there was a large price move which we may see the likes of again as we stay sitting at this $90 support.   TL:DR; misinformation but shouldn‚Äôt matter because 50% short interest still high as fuck
THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE WSB? THE SEC ARE HYPOCRITES AND LIERS THAT ARE PROTECTING THE RICH AND POWERFUL
From the very beginning, we knew these people weren't our friends. The SEC   VOWED   to protect retail traders, for ONCE. The media has swept this narrative under the rug, and are now happily pushing the new trend, calling for more regulation.  They have lied through their teeth.  CNBC hosts a show with Jim Cramer called MAD MONEY, where stocks are literally called left and right with little or ZERO fundamental analysis. The show itself does not provide any significant evidence to support these stock calls, but instead refers investors to THESTREET - a firm that does publish simple balance sheets of companies, then gives their 2 cents on such.       They decided to investigate us rather than the CNBC pumpers/fear mongers that pushed FALSE NARRATIVES FOR CITADEL, the hedgies which shorted more shares than existed with money that doesn't exist (crippled a company for years), and brokers that openly restricted trade of certain securities for little reason (this is real market manipulation).                We will water the fountain of liberty with the tears of bears and boomers. This is not over. They will soon be running SCARED SHITLESS. Notice how Gamestop the company didn't issue more shares and dilute. They didn't dilute at $500, $300, and here we are at $90 and still nothing. With 88%+ short interest, they must really know that this valuation is low. Not a single insider share has been sold either, to my knowledge. I will personally hold until GameStop dilutes and can fix their balance sheet, I literally want to see this company healthy again.   For the last time, THE MEDIA IS NOT OUR FRIENDS. They said we were a mob and called for more regulation at first before they realized it was popular to support us. They said we were "gamifying" trading. They said we were all radical right, and white supremecis. Worst of all they pushed a false narrative that we were pumping SLV, in a likely attempt to gain hype for a citadel long position, so they could liquidate and have more funds for GME covering.
GME & AMC    Don't let go, it's not time yet
Don't let these bots and naysayers get ya down boys and girls. Keep holding, this golden turd isn't ready to be cut yet.
GME simple explanation
This is very simple, for all the hype it‚Äôs easy to explain exactly what happened and what‚Äôs happening. Nikola, a company who has never produced a product and is widely believed to be outright fraud has a marker cap of ~$  as of Feb 3rd, 2021. GameStop, a company with ~40k employees in the growing industry of video games has a market cap of ~$6B. A few months ago a dynamic businessman, Ryan Cohen bought millions of shares of GameStop, and then joined the board with other former Chewy executives (an online pet supply store worth ~$40B). People who had long believed GameStop has more value than the market was giving it (a low of ~$250M total market value at one point), along with new people who now saw potential in this businesses turn around, bought stock in the business. That should be the end of the story.  It‚Äôs because hedge funds on Wall Street have again been so greedy that they risked the entire United States financial system. See, these hedge funds ‚Äúshorted‚Äù the stock, 140%. How can you have 140% of an entire companies stock? You can‚Äôt but they did. And the risk, which they never considered in their infinite wisdom, is infinite losses. Infinite losses? Yes, a stock price can go to $0 and the shareholders lose all their money and the company is bankrupt. But a stock has no top dollar amount, and when you‚Äôre short a stock, you bet it goes to 0, but if you‚Äôre wrong it can go as far up as any stock has ever gone for any reason. A good reason would be, the stock went up for fundamental reasons but the short positions couldn‚Äôt unwind because you can‚Äôt undo 140%, you could only undo 100%. Therefore, in using market manipulation to drive a company into bankruptcy they were suddenly faced with infinite losses, something that would send catastrophic ripples through the financial industry.  So, Robinhood. We all thought they were cool but like Facebook they‚Äôre fucking evil because they‚Äôre free, so instead of paying $6 a trade we pay $0, which was cool until last week when we found out that in spite of their name Robinhood, they are actually in the business of selling financial data to hedge funds. They take your trade order, and let the hedge funds know so their High Frequency Trading can arbitrage pennies on every trade by ‚Äúbeating‚Äù it to the order, millions of times a day. Ok, fuck us millennials, ok yeah but also, a little consumer protection, maybe? Ok - this is where it gets fucked.  What we learned Thursday is that Wall Street and the stock brokers do not have America‚Äôs interest their interest is to hedge funds and banks. Trading was restricted, whether it was Robinhood, the brokers, the Market Makers, we may never know but it‚Äôs not that important because it reveals that the system is fundamentally and structurally aligned to protect the few existing billionaires against Americans interest. This is a fatal sin against our democratic capitalism and risks everything we stand to be.  Moreover, they did it for a reason, the same people that control our stock markets, the barons of our nations wealth, also risked destroying them with infinite losses. How do you cover -140% to infinity? This would alter the value of every equity in America, so they shut it down.  Now, as we try to piece this together, one wrong is repairing the damage done to individual investors but the bigger change needs to be structural, prosecuting the criminals we allow to run our economy and rebuilding an equitable market to allow the American dream to prosper.

Eyes on the prize!
Every day the HFs have been outperformed by WSB, there‚Äôs been some dirty orchestrated attack or manipulation the night of or the day after. The ladder attacks, the restrictions, Robinhood, the media, the fake silver rush, the SEC imposters, and tonight you mean to tell me that out of nowhere, the WSB mod situation turned this whole page into a giant shithole? I don‚Äôt buy it. Whether the mods are fucked six ways to Sunday is not our biggest concern now. We need to focus on the task at hand and deliver another win tomorrow and the day after, and all next week. Put the HFs on their backs and don‚Äôt let up. That is all, my    Apes. GME/AMC to the moon!
Lets Beat Them at Their Own Game, I'm Done Playing By Their Rules... GAME ON! LETS WALK AWAY!!!!
After Robinhood had screwed over its users, I think everyone should sell everything they have on the app, cash out and abandoned Robinhood leaving them holding the bag. What they did to us users and manipulating the market to protect its hedge fund friends is not right or legal. The only action they will understand is to completely shut down their app. WALK AWAY and teach them that they can not control the market, and change the rules mid game, the power is with the people. WALK AWAY!!!! CASH OUT!!!
Hear ye! Hear ye! Veteran retards, fresh autists,   s, Hedgies, SEC interns, and our freshly lubed new mods... GME $420 eod AMC $42, because I like.. the heckin‚Äô.. stonks. When these prices are realized you (new mods) shall address me as, ‚ÄúThe Oracle‚Äù cheers bitches
GME - 420 eod because I like the stonk AMC - 42 eod because I like the stonk  New mods stole the eggs I stick up my ass when I watch my wife fuck the pool man  Evidence seen here ->
Am I allowed to ask when RH plans to go through with IPO? I want to abandon their platform before it shits the bed.
Yes or no answers only for my initial question, please.  I‚Äôm new to investing but feel like RH is screwing me and a LOT of other small investors, new or old.  So I want to get out before they go public.  Any advice (professional or not) is appreciated.  I plan on leaving their platform regardless but want to make sure I‚Äôm set up on another service and verified first.  Help please ü•∫

Let‚Äôs get momentum behind AMC.
Fuck this.  Everyone keeps saying there is no ‚Äúmomentum‚Äù.  We ARE the fucking momentum.  Buy AMC.
Take on GME for tomorrow
Make your own decision. Follow your gut. These other people telling you to hold have no stake or consequence in your loss or gain. Not to mention you have no idea if they‚Äôve even really held. Maybe they already sold and re bought with the profit then there‚Äôs you with your savings dunk into this...   You haven‚Äôt lost until you sell sure but what if it never goes back up? Well idk what you would call that other than a loss. It‚Äôs not in your bank account anymore right? I learned my lesson from this and was lucky enough to break even. Not saying it might not still go up but weigh the reality of true loss with the diminishing chance of gain.  Not saying to do or not to do anything but follow your gut. If your stomach is screaming it just ain‚Äôt right then it just ain‚Äôt right probably.   Good luck. üçÄ

What is happening to/in this sub ?
I hardly ever post on wsb, but I enjoy/have enjoyed reading through this sub from time to time for the past few months.  However this GME ( and I could add BB and AMC ) stuff has gotten out of hand.  We have gone from a couple of guys making a good play/gamble - and kudos to them --  on GME to some sort of an echo chamber shilling shit day in, day out.  " Let's take down hedge funds " " to the  " "   hands", etc....   What would be an estimate of how many people bought GME at insanely high prices after seeing all the shills ? 100s ? 1000s ? Millions ?  And how much have these people gambled, sorry invested ? 100s$? 1000s$? 10000s$?  Which leads me to my main question:  Was it the OG's on this sub ( the people who got into GME early ) plan all along to artificially boost the price in order to dump on noobs ? ( and I would not blame to them if it was the case, hate the game not the players ).  I am genuinely interested in your answers, and I truly do not understand what is happening.  I have 1 GME @ 120$, which represents an insignificant % of my investments  obviously. What are YOU in for ?

Zomedica's Truforma coming out in March
What are your thoughts on Zomedica as a company?   Based on what I have researched, this is a strong buy. The pet care market was   BN in 2019 and is expected to grow to   BN by 2026. Adding on top of that they are coming out with Truforma (in March of 2021)  a diagnostic platform that uses disposable assay cartridges to provide rapid in-office testing of whole blood, serum, and plasma. It can detect Thyroid disease in dogs and cats, and adrenal disease in dogs. They are also developing Gastrointestinal testing for Truforma too along with other diseases.   Based on the company's low marketcap at   (which has basically 5x in the last two months) they have a lot of room to grow to capture even 20 BN of the global pet care market. That would put there stock valuation somewhere in $20-$25 range. I believe it will be $3-7 within this year.

So who actually took GME profits?
I like many was hoping for 1k or more.  That being said depending on if you bought early enough you could of easily went to the moon at the prices it was.  I sold some to cover my cost basis, make some profit and have a few shares left to ride it until the end.  What say you?

$SLV is not going to get squeezed...$SLV is the Trojan Horse for the squeeze THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING
I have no horse in the GME "fight" right now.  I wish you all the best, and it is the biggest trading mistake of my life so far.  I was talking about GME with my friends in March 2020, and even did trade some options then for a loss.  I must have read DFV at some point, as we were discussing Burry and a "technical short squeeze" happening.  But I missed the real boat, so good on DFV and all of the rest of you degenerates.    Instead, I focused my market attention during quarantine on precious metals.  My opinion is that in the long term (10+ years) they will provide the only real hedge against inflation in the world as every CB on the planet is exploding the supply of fiat to deal with COVID economic disruption.    In the short term, I believe that the "powers that be" are engineering the largest short squeeze in the history of markets.  We do not have the power to effect whether this happens, it is simply an inevitability.  HFs, banks, and other large institutions are going to extract an enormous amount of wealth from the world during this squeeze.  This money will be taken from the future pocket of every consumer of industrial goods for the next several decades in the form of inflated prices on everything: batteries, electronics, solar panels,   jewelry and silverware.    We cannot stop them, but I have decided to try to hop on for the ride.  The last few months aside, I never saw WSB as a force for societal change, because the people who control the money are always going to win the most in the end.  WSB is a place where we can learn the tricks of a market that is structurally rigged against us, and use those tricks to our advantage.  To use an analogy that I think we all know: I am not, and will never be, Ender.  But I can learn that the Enemy's Gate is Down, and play The Game that way.     The tl;dr is this: the market for silver is the most manipulated physical market in the history of the world.  $SLV is the vehicle that is currently being used behind the scenes to vaccum up ownership of every available physical bar of silver in major bullion vaults in the world.  When it has completed doing that, the "paper" markets that have held down the price of silver for decades will become disconnected from the physical markets.  The energy that has been artificially held back for decades by this paper will explode the price of physical silver, and I have no idea how high it will go.  $SLV will stand (mostly) alone as the world's exchange traded product for electronic trading of physical silver.      # LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING: WHY IS SILVER IMPORTANT?  Silver has been used as real currency for thousands of years, and there is an argument to be made for returning to "sound" money through the use of silver and gold.  However, that is not the argument that I am making.  Silver is a highly industrial metal, and it's usage for industry will only continue to expand as we electrify the future.  Silver is important for electrical applications b/c it is the most-conductive / least-resistive metal in the universe (   It is used heavily in all electronic applications (even more since RoHS has pushed us away from Tin/Lead and towards Tin/Silver solder blends, with silver being added to mitigate the longevity problems of 100% Tin solder growing Tin whiskers and shorting out components).  But the largest new demands on silver are going to come from solar panels and EVs.  Utility-scale solar is now virtually tied with wind as the cheapest new sources of energy in the world and is only getting cheaper every year.  As fossil fuel plants continue to reach the end of their service life, they are going to be replaced with solar and wind technologies.  As EVs become more prevalent, their components (ESPECIALLY their batteries) will produce additional demand for Silver.  As smart investors are wont to do, this coming demand for industrial silver has been front-run and large quantites of silver have been sucked into investment products so that they can produce financial returns when demand begins to increase.  2020 showed remarkable investor interest in silver, to the tune of an estimated 350Mtoz moving into exchange traded products like $SLV.  $SLV alone added ~200Mtoz of silver to it's holdings in 2020.  Unfortunately for the market, supply cannot meet demand: Of the   estimated for 2020 demand, only 236Mtoz was available for physical investment, because the rest was consumed by industrial uses.  This means that $SLV alone absorbed almost the entire world's capacity for silver investment in 2020, and as you'll see soon, this is only accelerating in 2021.  Source for demand/supply/investment numbers:     # LETS GET PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL  Now it's important to understand that huge amounts of "silver" is traded on "paper" markets, and these markets have historically decided the approximate cost of physical silver in the world, in the form of the "spot price".  I'm not going to give anyone a primer on how this works, go read about the London Fix and COMEX paper on your own time.  But the important thing to know is that there are a bunch of silver bars in vaults in London and in the  , and electronic claims on them are traded on the LBMA and COMEX continuously, without the silver ever leaving the vaults.    However, these vaults have concrete numbers of physical bars in them, and trading contracts against them technically means that you can show up at a window somewhere and demand your 5x 1000oz bars that a COMEX warrant entitle you to.  This redemption happens all the time, and it can be used to extract physical silver from the unallocated storage at bullion vaults and release it to industrial or consumer bullion uses.  However, these bars can also be moved into "registered" or "allocated" accounts without them leaving the overall vault storage.  This means that a quantity of individual silver bars that an owner holds title to can be physically moved inside the vault onto a different rack, and the owner has individual serial numbers of bars that they own.  These bars can be withdrawn on demand only by their owner and are not available for general redemption of a COMEX warrant.  So how many bars are there? Well between LBMA and COMEX, there are   sitting in vaults (sources below when I start doing math).  This includes all allocated AND unallocated bars.  Now, obviously London and NY are separated by an ocean, but people always like to bring up that bars could be moved b/w London <-> American COMEX vaults.  This is an enormous undertaking, but let's make a "spherical chicken in a vaccuum" level assumption and say that LBMA + COMEX vaults are a singular source of inventory for both $SLV and other market participants.  If you read the $SLV S-1 (which I did:   you would learn that the custodian of the $SLV trust is required to hold all silver weight (with an exception for 1100toz of unallocated, lol) that is owned by the trust in allocated accounts, where the individual bars are physically segregated inside the vaults, and the serial numbers of the owned bars are explicitly recorded.  The idea that there is "no physical silver" backing the SLV trust and "you could get settled with cash" is _ridiculous_.  iShares publishes a report listing every serial number of every bar that is owned by the trust, along with the total weight contained in the bars.  It is 10847 pages long (you can read it here if you have trouble sleeping at night:   and is updated frequently.  The underlying silver is _owned_ by the trust.  It cannot be removed from the trust unless "baskets" of 50000 shares are redeemed by an "Authorized Participant" which is only a few large brokers.  It cannot be removed by the bullion vaults and given to other customers because it is physically segregated inside the vaults.  People who have recently beaten down the idea of a silver squeeze love to talk about how JP Morgan is the custodian for the SLV trust.  And because JPM just paid a $1B fine for historical manipulation of the paper silver market, they aren't going to be honest about this.  This is crazy talk.  When it comes to the dishonesty of a big bank, there is "fraud" and there is FRAUD.  "Fraud" would be them saying "Oh sorry, we didn't realize that a laundromat bringing in $300k/week of dirty dollar bills was out of the ordinary". "Fraud" happens all the time, and the banks get away with it regularly.  FRAUD would be them saying "Oh yes, 3rd party customer (iShares) who services dozens of other large banking institutions in the world, here is objective evidence, with serial numbers, that we have these silver bars in the vault" and then just making up the data.  It is QANON-level crazy, IMHO, to think that JPM is going to commit FRAUD by publishing a list of serial numbers that is completely fake.    I believe the exact opposite: since they _have_ just gotten caught, they are playing it straight this time and have just switched sides in order to go long.  On the COMEX alone, JP Morgan Chase is long  , or just north of $5B.  The problem for the futures and options markets is that their continual trading of paper contracts is chasing a smaller and smaller amount of physical silver that is not owned by $SLV.  And the market participants (minus, now, JPM) who have gotten away with naked selling of paper contracts and mostly settling them for cash are going to soon find the underlying vaults empty and no metal to give to warrant holders who come looking for it.    # HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS $SLV FOR THE NAKED SHORTS IN THE PAPER MARKET? LET'S DO SOME MATH.  $SLV inventory math:  $SLV is holding 669,357,  troy ounces in trust, and has 720,500,000 shares outstanding.    (If you are curious why $SLV/share trades below the spot price, it's because:   /   shares = .929 toz / share)  ($SLV data from here:   )  (screenshot from tonight for posterity:     Bullion vault inventory math:  London (LBMA) silver stocks are   (   US COMEX silver stocks are   (     +   =   of the vaulted silver in the world is already owned by SLV  Subtracting what SLV already owns, leaves us with: (  +   -   =    (This is _completely_ ignoring the fact that a lot of that remaining silver is owned in registered or allocated accounts by individual owners.    there is   in "registered" on the COMEX which means those bars are already specifically deeded to an individual owner. But they could theoretically sell it to SLV so I included it as available.)    is the ABSOLUTE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM available in LBMA + COMEX silver that is not _already_ owned by SLV.   Now how short are the shorts?  Some more math:  OI on COMEX futures:        + 179786 5000toz     + 130402 5000toz      +   8245 1000toz     +   1903 2500toz          -     1,563,942,500 =    in currently open interest that could be demanded for delivery.  Just on the COMEX, there could be demand for twice as much silver as there is in the combined LBMA + COMEX vaults that is not explicitly owned by $SLV right now.    Caveats:   - I have not included any London futures contracts that may have claims on metal here.  I am not versed in their contracts at all and don't have a good data source right now.  If anyone knows how to calculate the short obligation for London I would be glad to add it.  - I have not analyzed any of the strike prices on COMEX options or dates on COMEX   of them could be way out of the money or way in the future.  Many silver producers sell futures years in advance to lock in prices, and then deliver the physical to satisfy the contracts.  Using the same basic methodology‚Äìtotal shorts divided by shares [toz in this case] outstanding‚Äìas is used on a stock to calculate short interest (and gave us the infamous 140% short interest on GME) we get......drumroll please:    short /   physical =   short interest.    OPEN INTEREST ON COMEX SILVER FUTURES AND OPTIONS IS EQUIVALENT TO A   SHORT INTEREST AGAINST ALL LONDON AND   AVAILABLE INVENTORY.      But it gets even worse.      # WANNA ADD A GAMMA SQUEEZE??  I pulled the data for all current OI in SLV options.  There is a large number (  million) of call contracts open (here are the totals:    Using the .929toz/share number, we can calculate that there are up to   that would have to be bought during an absolute runaway Gamma Squeeze.  Call options on $SLV max out right now at $55, so the spot price would only have to increase by around 122% to reach the point that all of that weight would need to have been purchased.  But at some point, it could become self-reinforcing, and the gamma squeeze continues to cause more gamma squeezing.    I believe that this almost happened Sunday evening (2021-01-31) as evidenced by the huge premium that $SLV was trading to the futures price for a few minutes when trading opened.  (My comparison chart:     The Silver ETF that trades on Sunday in Tel Aviv (  closed up >6% (and was consistenly rising for the entire session) before any american spot markets opened.  I believe that hedging algorithms at MM firms that write options saw this spike as a need to buy shares in $SLV to cover their deltas, and so they bought the opening of $SLV like crazy.  $SLV opened up  , while paper only opened up about 6%.  Paper market players had to sell   of paper in the first minute of trading to keep the price under control.  I have never seen an imbalance like this before, and it was covered up quickly (within 2 hours of trading).  But to me, it sounds like Vincent's heartbeat monitor in GATTACA when he runs out of fake signal: there was a cover up required to hide this explosion.  When the day comes that this cover up is not executed properly, stuff is going to get ugly, b/c $SLV won't just gamma squeeze like a normal stock...    # BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! A TRADITIONAL GAMMA/SHORT SQUEEZE WILL SEEM LIKE NOTHING IN SILVER  The squeeze in silver will be FAR WORSE than the combination of a gamma and short squeeze in a stock, because shares of stock cannot be removed from the market.  Eventually somebody holding $VW or $GME is going to say "sure, I'll sell at $42,  per share" and that share can go back to cover a short.  But if instead of doing that, the holder of that share withdrew it from the market by converting it to a physical token b/c they thought that the physical token would be more valuable than the share (the retail premium on physical silver vs. paper silver), the short interest would INCREASE as shares were converted into tokens.  And since there are currently more "shares" of silver than there are bars of silver in the vault, the shorts can be caught with a literally illiquid market that has nothing to buy.  Zero.  Zilch.  No silver available.  The doomsday scenario (for paper silver holders and writers) is the following combination:  - holders of COMEX warrants will see the rising premium of physical bullion to the spot price and decide to redeem their warrants for physical   - a rising spot price will Gamma Squeeze the writers of $SLV options into buying more shares in a runaway fashion and the trust will absorb all available vault inventory as it issues new shares  COMEX warrant holders who try to demand metal that doesn't exist will literally break the market.    The CBOE will probably step in and decide to force settle the contracts for cash at the last known good price, and   COMEX paper warrants will cease trading forever.    The physical market price will then be disconnected from the paper market, and $SLV as an exchange traded product will stand (mostly) alone as the new "paper" market for silver.     # SO WTF DO I DO? [NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE]  Well I could always buy physical silver, if I can stomach the premium and wait 8 weeks for it to show up.  Or, I could just get long on $SLV.  Since I believe that $SLV will stand alone after the dust settles as the one true claim on bars in the vaults, I could be long the actual $SLV ticker in several ways:  - Buying shares (duh, but it worked for $GME)  - Buying long dated calls (Gamma Squeeze go BRRRRR, but who knows when)  - Buying option spreads (my personal favorite)  If I wanted to maximize my contribution to the Gamma Squeeze, I'd probably buy as much Delta/$ as I could get using weeklies, which would be 2/5 $  or 2/12 $28C   (Max delta/$ calculations:   and    Current open positions for me are: (   - Jan'22 50/55 call spread (costs .17, moonshot pays $5, 29x)  - 4/16 40/55 call spread (costs .18, moonshot pays $15, 83x)  - 2/5 $  call (to maximize delta/$)  - jan'22 $40 call (to minimize risk of missing the big one)  - $AG shares and jan'23 10/35 call spread (added, sorry i forgot this one:     Footnote, all the pictures I think I used, in case i missed something:
GME Speculation: price may drop to the $60-30 range before the squeeze is squoze
I'm retarded so don't take this as financial advice but based on the current GME pattern looks like we'll see a small spike during the Thursday premarket and it'll then drop into the $60-30 range by the end of the day. On Friday the pattern will tighten up and we'll likely see either $GME fall to oblivion or a big ass spike by Monday. IDK if the spike will be the squeeze, but It'll be big. The number of   which should make it possible for more apes to buy the dip and drive the squeeze.        "We can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent"
Is there any lawsuit I can sign up for if I believe Robinhood manipulated the market?
My option call expires Friday and am hella out of the money. Because I believe Robinhood manipulated the price of AMC, I am now shit out of $650. Am I just totally screwed?
Im holding GME $5k
Just to let you know I‚Äôm here. Got $5k @ average 107.  Apparently fuck this sub. Ill hold no problem. Dont care about chimp change.
What platform should I use to invest?
I am a beginner on this, wanted to start but had no money, now I can and don't know which platform is better. Robinhood? Fidelity?
Tendie Land Board Game
Like Candy Land but instead of family or no family and school or no school you choose bets. And whether to sell or hold.  Spin the wheel decides your fate.
So Legal Eagle says our lawsuits will likely fail
Due to the arbitration clause. That said, however, he mentioned it can get P-R-E-T-T-Y expensive for Robinhood if we ALL filed arbitration.  They have to eat that cost. JAMS costs $1750/filing and 12% for time, management, etc. Their costs to the individual filing: $250.   So let‚Äôs just say HALF of the userbase opens up arbitration. That‚Äôs nearly   billion in just the filing   in that 12% fee and the question becomes how quickly will Robinhood run out of money.   Just a thought   we could hurt them and the tie up in arbitration would last so long the company would be out of business before they‚Äôd even be able to review those cases.

On a whim threw a few calls before the bell and earning release... Hopefully all gains go to GME to average down. Did we decided if one share at a time or a block order hurts them more?
Support DFV! Fight HF and battle the cause.
Join us in DC with signs ‚ÄúWe LIKE the STOCK‚Äù during the hearing. Friendly apes please reply.
Guys, we literally took on the hedge funds. OFC we are going to have cuts and bruises.
Seriously, we took on the big dogs. OFC we aren't going to come out all pretty and happy, but you know what? NEITHER DID THEY. They are licking their wounds as we type just as we are. IMO the battle isn't over. It's just begun. So there may not be another squeeze, but Game Stop is making progress and WE HELPED GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE!!! Same with AMC! If it weren't for us they would have likely succumbed to these vultures we call "hedge funds". Those of you who bought in at over $300 or what ever price? There is a chance you could make that money back in the years to come. This is not financial advice, but the old saying goes "you only loose money when you sell".  My position: 8 GME averaged at around $95, 6 BB, 10 AMC. It's not much but even going to $500 would be life changing and that's why I had hope. It's why I'm still not selling even if GME goes below my $95. I'll wait it out. I don't care how long it takes. I might even buy more if it continues to dip! I like dip! My favorite flavor of dip is red!  Obligatory NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. Only invest what you are willing to loose.
Ode to WSB
The blood was high when WSB discovered their MacGuffin  Then screeching down they came like hungry seagulls on a muffin  Scarce were crumbs of logic in this crime against all reason  Profit goblins lectured though they had no expertise in  The nature of the beast that woke as frantic hope ablated  Then apes prepared their feces once they came to know what waited  "Despair" the beast was known as and its gaze fell on the masses  Shrieking hordes of paper handed monkeys spread their asses  And did what origami simians are prone to do  Cry despair and show us all they're full of spineless poo  Yet sterner still were gazes from the rulers of this land  Those that grin and bear with loving heart and diamond hand  Salute then, to my brethren short of wit and smooth of brain  There's not a finer class of tard I'd party with again
The New GME game plan: PUTS! BUY PUTS AND MORE PUTS! Sell all your SHIT and make money on the way back DOWN! Duh üôÑ
So here is a way for all the retarded apes to get down from the top of the redwood..  Everyone - first of all - just understand that stocks don‚Äôt actually only go up.  They can go down too.  And guess what?  Unlike cryptocurrency you can buy these things called PUTS which allow you to make money when a stock goes DOWN.   So here is the plan:  1.  Sell all your shares and calls.    Why?  the upward momentum was killed..  look at your fucking chart you stupid dumbfucking retard.   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  2.  We create DOWNWARD MOMENTUM AND SELLING PRESSURE from SELLING!   Why?  You will stop losing money, and just lock in whatever you have left.    Why?  Because we are going to re-invest ourselves into a NEW OPPORTUNITY.    Once everyone has stopped being stupid and minimized their never ending loss ..  the stock will just PLUMMET instead of this retarded FLAT movement that makes no money for anyone.    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 3.  We invest everything into DEEP OTM PUTS expiring this Week or Next Week expiration -   If we made the stock go up we can make it go down - AND PROFIT!!  So SELL YOUR SHIT  AND BUY PUTS SO WE ALL MAKE MOON MONEY!    Positions:  100 contracts of 2/5 expiration 30$ PUTS   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- 4.  ??????!  PROFIT FROM PUTS   THEY FUCKED US ALREADY!    ITS OVER SO GET OVER IT AND LEARN HOW TO STILL MAKE MONEY FROM THIS SITUATION!  BUY PUTS AND SELL.  MAKE MONEY.   YOU CAN STILL MOON AND DIAMOND HAND PUTS.  So once again:  GME PUTS ANY STRIKE ANY FUCKING EXPIRATION.
DO NOT SELL. Why GME is going to $1000 next week!
First of all if you are reading this post and do not own any GME stock, go and buy some right now. Ok, now that that is taken care of, I have done some thinking and have discovered some interesting things. I will list 3 reasons why GME is not over, and why this is actually going to shoot to new records this week or next week.   TLDR: GME is going to 800-1000 by next week because all the bitch paper handers are out, there is also a possibility of a second short squeeze happening any day now       The other day when GME fell 60%, the volume for that day did not even pass the average daily volume. Yes let me repeat that, when the stock went down 60%, there was so little amount of sellers, we did not even pass the daily volume. This means that the people who are paper hand bitches have already sold, because if GME goes down 60% and you haven't sold, good news for you, you are a diamond hand baller. Now this leads to my second point.       So that the only people left holding GME are the diamond hand chads, it will be really hard to get us to sell. If anything this dip has been a blessing to allow us to grab more stock at cheap. We have held the ground of around $100 or a good 2 days. If you do not know, GME was way below that at the beginning of its new found value. The short percentage is still super high, even though the old shorts may be out, there are now new shorts that think this thing is going back down. But once they realize that won't happen, they will stop risking it and just buy back the stock. Now this is what can kickstart the next short squeeze which I think can easily go to 800-1000       Now if those two reasons weren't good enough. Gamestop has hired new executives and professionals to the company from very successful companies. This means that they are not letting this opportunity go to waste and make some money from it. And remember, a company is worth however much the people who buy the stock believe it is worth at.

DFV testifying and how to help
In the coming days, leading to Feb 18, all retards should start posting and sharing GME and DFV articles supporting the movement outside of reddit. Especially to Facebook, where the 90 year old congress people actually have a presence.  How congress views public opinion of the movement will most likely shape the line of questioning during the hearing. Remember, at the end of the day, the congress people are looking to win votes.
Remember remember!
Remember remember!  The 4th of Febtember, The GMEpowder treason and plot.      I know of no reason  Not to hold through the season  To the moon or lest GME be forgot      üí™üôè
Well the HFs are celebrating right now
Is this thread imploding wtf is happening  5000 shares of   is scary times for me
With it without wsb I will continue holding
Even tho weird stuff going on in wsb and if this sub goes down I will continue to hold because I like the stock with or without the community‚ù§Ô∏è   is in my dna and I will continue!!!!!
Stay strong
Pretty sure we are being flooded by people trying to crash our morale and get the reddit channel banned. Stay strong against the bots/spys until they are banned by the mods.
Don't be fooled by this noise! It's proof there's something to catch HOLD!!
This noise only makes it more clear that there are actors in play to make us sell. But hey, I'm just a retarded ape   which locked himself up in this   and who's gonna HOLD!!!  No trading advice or whatsoever, I'm just a retarded   in a   with
Don't screw this up over a mod squabble
have joined this community because your passion and excitement have inspired them to learn, talk stocks, try to make a better life for themself, and take their mind off all the shitty stuff in the world. I know this because I'm one of them. Don't fuck this opportunity up because of a mod squabble. Sucks that it's happening but that's fucking life man. The mods are engaged in political bullshit right   let them handle their business and we can just keep being apes.
Stuck in RobinHood hell
I want to close my account, but I can‚Äôt because there is a small balance in the account.  I‚Äôm not going to risk my bank account info being stolen by robinhood for $8.  So how do I close this account?  I‚Äôve tried contacting their customer support to request a check, but that seems to be futile.   Alternatively, I‚Äôm all for playing games with the account if it will cost them money.  But I‚Äôd rather close it to reduce their userbase.
Fuck off with all the $GME pessimism!
This is exactly what the hedgies are hoping for! They want us to get bored, lose interest or panic sell. It's been 3 fucking down days this week! Hold with your   üèº and we will       - there's no time frame on this at all. We have to be more patient than them. The cards and data are still in our favour. Nothing has changed. This isn't financial advice, I eat crayons.
AURORA CANNABIS ABOUT TO TAKE OFF
Huge bull flag on the weekly, this is primed to run back to $20 in the short term! Get in early folks
This has turned into r/conspiracy
You people are legit insane. Holding a dying stock and screaming from the roof tops that anything happening you don‚Äôt like is some mystery hedge fund trying to destroy your beloved subreddit...  The fact is, you Neanderthals didn‚Äôt sell to make money, you held too long and are being burned alive for what? For unity with people you‚Äôve never met and never will?  Grow up, this isn‚Äôt some high school clique, this is real people losing real money by the bucketfuls and all I see in here is encouragement to hold longer and lose more.  I still have GME and am hoping it does go up again so I can get out as fast as I can, because I was in the green and sold twice but bought back in when I knew it was a bad play. Did it anyway just because of the rhetoric.   Don‚Äôt be like me. Get the fuck out and stay out if you‚Äôre not already in up to your eyeballs in these worthless meme stocks.  It‚Äôs not a hedge fund conspiracy, it‚Äôs the fact that regular, rational thinking people got out when they should have, like I did twice before, and they didn‚Äôt go back in exactly like they should have done.
WSB Won't take the L, we aren't your servants anymore.

How is it that Yellen with the SEC can in good faith accept money from Citadel. $700,000! Can someone please explain?
How is this not a conflict of interest? If WSB comes up with some sweet tendies, can we too send some speaking ‚Äúfees‚Äù.
I want to thank all of you, and most importantly DFV.
To be able to have the chance to be apart of something so historic and potentially life changing. Even if I somehow lose my ass, this whole experience has made me become more informed in investing, more interested in investing, and to achieve the feeling of being apart of something way bigger than myself. I‚Äôve lurked here forever, but never thought anything serious would come from it.  It‚Äôs awesome to know that I can explain this to my kids, because I know in a few years when they get into high school it something that‚Äôll be taught. For every ape and tard that has won or loss, that kept this subreddit going, thanks. Sincerely, I‚Äôve learned more about stocks and investing in the last week then I suspect I ever would have.  Sentimental things aside, look at all the donations, and positive impacts this whole whole event has brought into fruition. A bunch of crayon and paint chip eating retarded apes really left a mark.   And it‚Äôs not over, hold strong. Diamond hands, let‚Äôs go to the moon. I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever have an opportunity like this again.   (This is not financial advice, I‚Äôm definitely retarded. Banana is my favorite number of the alphabet)  Feel free to share your sentiments
HOLD THE LINE
Mfs talking about holding the line like its the war of 1812üò≠ we gotta be smarter if the goal is to ‚Äúbeat‚Äù the hedge funds Yall the first step is being realistic... hate seeing you all take losses with real $$ that you definitely need
I SOLD IT ALL HERE‚ÄôS WHY
So I could buy GME, BB, and AMC. Oh and I should probably mention the fact that this sub is the victim of an illegal cyberattack orchestrated by the hedge funds who are loosing at their own game! Tons of other posts about it on here, go look for yourself.
THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT FUD
But    stronger together.  They are using battle tactics.  Divide and conquer.  BUT    STRONGER TOGETHER        HOLD THE FCKING LINE
Community Observation (schills, bots, toxicity)
Today, we held the line. Today, them diamond hands shined    .   I have loss porn for days, particularly the last two days. After GME/AMC and the rest took a dive yesterday, a second day of losses, and a lot of the less involved community thought the books were closed and the flames from the paper hands burned bright - I noticed a lot less toxicity and tangential chatter. I have not been part of this community for very long but I am quite invested in what it is now standing for and I have backed that with my own capital as much as I am able to.   Today everything seemed to be much more United and positive in the community as   we held the line, big dog officers were hired by GME, and DFV reaffirmed his presence......  When things began to look better and we started celebrating the close with ‚Äújust‚Äù a couple percent above opening, the posts and comments noticeably began to become much more befuddled with doubtful, argumentative and aggressive rhetoric and disinformation.   We are on the right path. The more confused and angry and doubtful people seem to get, the closer we are to the moon. Trust your gut and protect yourselves. Check someone‚Äôs karma and post history and question what they may represent before your let yourself become consumed by their intentions.
ATTENTION: Gamestop Careers anyone?
This is not the look of a dying retail   LOVE this stock.
Question
How true is it that if we all set our sell price to 1000 it can drive the price to that range? Sorry im new at this
Calm Your Tits
Listen up retards,  You all need to calm the fuck down. This sub has went through weird shit before and it will go through it again in the future.  1. We need the mods to address what is happening.  2. Check the integrity of the accounts spamming. A lot of them it‚Äôs their first time posting here, or they have had previously deleted posts from a few days ago. (Kinda sketches me out like the silver bots last weekend)  3. Calm the fuck down. This is exactly what the hedge funds want us to do. We can‚Äôt have this type of chaos this week.  B. GME             (This is not financial advice, but it is advice for you retarded fucks.)
I LOVE YOU HUMANS
And I hate watching this place implode but you better believe I will be HOLDING FOREVER $GME
Talk about hijack?
Hey guys I just hopped back on this sub and see all this talk about a mod hijack. I don‚Äôt see any of that going on could be fake news as a ploy to blow us up internally cause separated we‚Äôre dumb but together we‚Äôre retarded and unless we‚Äôre all together we are weak. No matter what ends up happening to this sub it was a fun ride but just know I WILL BE HOLDING WITH YOU ALL WITH OR WITHOUT HAVING THIS SUB we have come too far to let this ruin us just keep holding even tho we may be separated!     you   trust in one another ü™ñü™ñ
CALM THE FUCK DOWN. WHATEVER YOU DO AND WHATEVER THE FUCK IS GOING ON - HOLD YOURE SHIT!   ü§ö
It shouldn‚Äôt matter what is going on - all you need to know is - HOLD YOUR SHIT!  Edit: I‚Äôm just a retard and this is not financial advice I just like the stock
Let‚Äôs still stand together?
I stay quiet and watch just being a widow licker. But these recent events saddens the big ape. I assume this the end game. Someone is holding the gauntlet right now. Hopefully that snap is in our favor. Whatever happens just know no one will silence our voices. This isn‚Äôt over and will never be over. Your discussions opinions?
Are we screwed?
I'm   ing but I can't help but fear this is going to drop the price of GME and AMC even lower. WSB was our command center and if it falls due to the ongoing hijack there will be little hope for others to hold, and with the community divided it will be harder to coordinate anything. Am I making any sense or am I just a paranoid little shit?  Edit: making it clear I'm holding till we hit the dirt. I don't have anything to lose and didn't sell my left kidney to buy in.

You've Heard of Sue Bae but Are You Overlooking E Bae? (EBAY)
EBAY had a nice jump after reporting earnings today, closing higher after hours at $ , up from $  at the close (   Q4 Results:    Revenue was $  billion, up 28% on both an as-reported basis and a foreign exchange (FX) neutral basis.   Gross merchandise volume (GMV) was $  billion, up 21% on an as-reported basis and up 18% on an FX-Neutral basis.   Annual active buyers grew by 7%, for a total of 185 million global active buyers.   Dividends increased by 13% to $   Other Information:    Expanded share repurchases by an additional $  billion.   Promoted Listings yielded over $215 million of revenue in Q4, up 60% on an as-reported basis.   Annual Ad revenue surpassed $1 billion for the year.   Authenticity Service support for watches/sneakers - resulting 2-3x GMV growth in respective categories.   Continued expansion of Managed Payments,   other options besides PayPal.   Raised $123 million in charity donations. (Potentially supporting some of the autists in this sub).   On earnings call, talked about leveraging influencers and TikTok to partially drive sales/ user growth on the platform.  There was also an Ebay app notification sent out mid afternoon, as someone else   also pointed out, which some retards could possibly interpret as "hold" because it's going "up" at least "15%". However, Cramer told a caller tonight that it's a buy, and inverse Cramer is usually the play.  In addition, of Ebay's last 67 quarterly reports, on periods where it closed with a gain after hours - the following day closed higher 22/33 (67%) of the time.  Interested to see where people think this is going post earnings near/long term, if anywhere. Ebay gets a lot of hate but I am personally holding shares and various calls. Finally might get back some of those seller fees.

INVESTOR'S DINNER
It's my intention here to gather the knowledge of our fellow collective of Retards.  Putting out the call to all of my fellow Loss Porn Degenerates like the Bat Signal        Calling all Retards  WSB Investors Dinner - Chicago 2021?  HFs do it.. Why don't we get together so we can all talk about how much we like the stock! If this gets 100k i swear to Harambe, I will like the invite S  myself...
Our last stand or our greatest test
The place we come to share retarded ideas and even more retarded trades has become undone by greed. As always, the ones with power will so frivolously be bought shamelessly in the attempt to take the credit for something they neither help create or cultivate. I hope the GME movement stays strong and I hope this sub can be saved. I had more fun being apart of this sub for the month and a half I have been here than I have in a long while. Hold the fucking line. Position: $GME   shares @   Not financial advice you
RH Allows Fractional Share Buying of GME
For those who want to get in, but might not be completely invested in the idea, RH is now allowing fractional shares of GME to be purchased again.  Do with this information as you will, I am   and am just looking for  , and in no way am I a financial advisor.
Goodbye WSB
Well everything looks like it‚Äôs going up in flames. Feels like slowly going down into the face of a mountain on a plane. Hopefully another fun sub comes around, or somehow this shit gets fixed. Down 11k on GME. Never selling.   Positions: 90 shares of GME @218            Edit: Really enjoyed the laughs and good times along the way. The loss was worth it.
I'm proud of everyone, BRAVO!
As a fellow man in poverty, I just want to extend my honors to everyone who took part in this GAMESTOP (and other positions) gain! I unfortunately saw the news after the fact but wouldn't be able to invest anyways. The last time I did invest was right after my military service when a fellow veteran in Las Vegas NV named Nathan Mandarich stole over $10,00 from me (got away scot-clean too). Anyways I digress, this is inspiring to see. I don't feel so hopeless anymore and maybe one day will be my day too. Be well everyone, I'm proud of you'll!
THERE ARE STILL REAL PEOPLE HERE. APES STRONG TOGETHER!!!
Don't let this fear play get in your head.  There are real people still here and we still like this stock.

Going long on my dick
A month ago I found out that I have a big dick, thanks to a UK newspaper article leading me to measure my kit.  Since then my sex life has gone through the roof (due to my partner & I now understanding the reason for our problems) and I now rarely look at porn.  However as a test I fired up pornhub this morning.  It's very strange : all those big dicks in the videos ... aren't big any more!  The change in my perception is especially obvious when watching the amateur videos.  It's very odd realising that I am bigger than practicality all the dicks I see.  I simply cannot understand how I never realised this before.  I have a suspicion that my new found knowledge may reduce my interest in porn, as I will no longer 'look up to' the big dicks ... because they no longer seem impressive.
Boycott robinhood ?
I know I wasn‚Äôt the only one that bought nokia waiting to hit 10 then market closed

The meaning of Hold
It means to not look at a certain stonks until it can't go tits up.  Now, can we switch focus to BB for the next 2-3 weeks and PLTR for another 2-3 weeks?  In order for any stonks to go up, energy has to be consolidated.  Need time.

GME turns ONLINE SHOP?
GME JUST PICKED OFF KEY PLAYERS AND ARE MAKING SOME MAJOR MOVES!  Hold the Fnn LINE    #GME #AMC
Art of war
Anyone else think this current ploy to sew distrust amongst each other is just the next step in their attempts at dismantling wsb?
App
Very sure other people have made this post, I know most people left Robinhood, I‚Äôm just asking what apps are y‚Äôall using for stocks now? I downloaded a few, looked at a few videos to find the best ones but I‚Äôm curious on what y‚Äôall are using.
What I think is happening (w/ GME) is that the shorts have already made their money.
I don‚Äôt know nothing about nothing, but everyday we get these crazy swings where GME hits sub $90 for a bit then goes up to mid $120+. What if the shorts were able to source together more money so that they buy those dips in large amounts and sell at the top then do some market stuff (short ladder, straight trading, etc) to make the price go down? Like what if they‚Äôre all in on us and just take turns making money on those  trades. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre messing with us and profiting off these dips and purposely keeping it within reach to give us a glimpse of hope.   Idk just my two ¬¢
Just keep holding ...
Wow,   takes a day off to eat sleep and polish     and the site turns to shit complete with teen porn?!  Holding to the moon            Ride or die!

APES. MONKEYS. CHIMPS.
Apes all hold the line. No selling, only buying. Only enemy of ape sell now.  Seriously, buy AMC if you haven't. I predict Friday will be a huge green day for us all. Soon, AMC will hit reach 20, then 25 then 30, then 35....
It's over.
These last couple of days has had people really show their true colors.  It's time to move on from here.

I love you, not just ‚Äúlike‚Äù you...
I don‚Äôt just like the   love the stock. I thought it was a lot of fun buying every dip today. I plan on doing the same tomorrow, using my diamond hands to secure my lot. I‚Äôve never been so excited to potentially lose money before. I‚Äôm just an idiot who knows absolutely nothing about finance but when I look at the volume and I see the charts...

Can someone explain Rule 203(b)(3) to me?
What exactly is the impact here, it says they're "required to close-out their position" after 13 days.  >Rule 203(b)(3) applies to fails to deliver in threshold securities if the participant‚Äôs fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Although as a result of compliance with Rule 204, generally a participant‚Äôs fail to deliver positions will not remain for 13 consecutive settlement days, if, for whatever reason, a participant of a registered clearing agency has a fail to deliver position at a registered clearing agency in a threshold security for 13 consecutive settlement days, the requirement to close-out such position under Rule 203(b)(3) remains in effect.  Edit:  Just to clarify, what does "required to close-out" really mean - legally?  They have to start buying during regular trading hours?  They have to close BY the end of the 13th day?  We know that just based on the volume (and diamond hands) it will take literal days for the positions to be covered, but how is THAT affected by 203(b)(3)?
Dear WSB
I‚Äôm in love with the YOLO.. I‚Äôve been with this sub for years... but what‚Äôs happened the past few months although absolutely incredible, life changing, and nationally recognized. This is not why I‚Äôm here. I was here for the big dick trades, the new ideas, and autistic ass trades. All I see here is GME. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong. FUCK THE HFs and I‚Äôm still fucking holding. But you know what. I‚Äôm holding a shit ton more of something else. And it‚Äôs a fucking real YOLO from a real guy who‚Äôs up $20k this month.. if needs I got proofs and shit. But I‚Äôm done with GME and BB and AMC and all these fucking meme stocks. That‚Äôs not what WSB was about. We were about a community of autist individuals who found exploits LIKE GME, or forward thinking company‚Äôs LIKE TSLA. So for those people who crave what I crave and not the other 7 million people who joined in January.. I‚Äôve created r/iminlovewiththeyolo now I have no funking clue how to run a subreddit and all that. But here it goes. This is my attempt, love you all.   -yakkamah  Out
If you shoot for the moon and miss you will still land amongst the stars
The markets are closed right now but with all the shit that's happening you better believe I'm buying the dip. I came into it late but I believe in the apes! And I've been shouting the message to anyone that might listen. Started off with just a single GME and now I have 3 thanks to the dip. I will hold until the nukes hit, if that's what it takes!

How I think this will all play out
My Prediction: Diamond hands, GME, and HFers will come out of this okay, at the expense of paperhands and non WSB retail investors. How will this play out? WSB retailers are now wise to the game: HF and MMs control the price of the stock and the mainstream media. This time, we are in control of the shares. HFs need those shares, but diamond hands aren‚Äôt giving them up. So how do the HF‚Äôs get them back? By making average cnbnc viewers buy them. But how?  Massive short laddering and FUD   are an obvious ploy at shaking out any paper porn toys they can find. Every paperhand folding now is a cheaper share they need to buy back. Anyone left with skin in the game is gonna be hard to shake off, but HFers aren‚Äôt gonna just pay up. How will they get the average retailer to pay up?  There are a massive amount of 3/19 800$ calls that have been purchased. HFers will use this to recover some of their money. One day, between 2/5 and 3/19, GME price will skyrocket from 90-100$ all the way up to 500$, as HFers cover their shorts. Some of us will cash out our investments, and leave a few shares to speculate, others will fully cash out. CNBC and CNN will be screaming from their platforms that the short squeeze has begun, and everyone should pile in and get those sweet gainz. Average retailers will pile on, driving the price up to somewhere between 500-1000. Then, the HFers will ladder the stock down to 100, shaking down new paperhanders for cheap shares. They‚Äôll leave it back at 100 for a few days to see if any other paperhanders walk off. CNN/CNBC will help drive off investor confidence with FUD  . Rinse and repeat. Eventually, HFers will get the shares they need by buying these shares up on the cheap from paperhanding retailers trying to get in on the squeeze, not knowing that HFers and MMs can artificially control the price of the stock through a combination of short laddering and short buybacks. Combined with the 2/5 puts, the 3/19 calls, and the massive swings in price that the HFers can control, they will make all of their money back.  Final outcomes? Diamond hands will make big gains. No way are we getting back in at 500 if we know they can short ladder down to 100. Average retailers will come in and buy shares from diamond hands for 1000$ hoping it will go to 2000$ the next day, only to paperhand them to HFers for 100$. New retailers will flock to WSB to see the massive gains as folks cash out, get greedy, buy in, only to get slaughtered the next day. WSB will be filled with gain and loss porn. GME will come out as a multibillion dollar company with a share value from 100-300, with strong investor confidence. CNBC and CNN will hail WSB as a hallmark moment for the little man that saved GME and will change the game forever.  WSBers will forget about the short ladder attacks, the FUD  , the trade freezing, etc., because hey, we made money right? Anyone who bought in at 500 and held on for dear life will have a chance of getting out. Hell, WSBers will be laughing at the average retail investor that gets slaughtered, because they should have known better, right? A few hedge funds will walk out making massive gains, a few hedge funds will implode, and nothing on wall street will change, except they‚Äôll start taking WSB a lot more seriously. The average retail investor will continue to get screwed by wall street because they don‚Äôt know that wall street controls the pricing on stocks.  Bulls make money, Bears make money, Pigs get slaughtered  This is not financial advice, and I am a retard.
Fidelity taking a week to authenticate my account
As the post title States, opened a Fidelity account bc they don't restrict trading. But it's been a week to authenticate. I can't add cash into my account to buy stocks until this passed. Is this normal? Should I call cs?      Stay strong trying to join the retards. And funny worry it's money in ok with losing our taking to the      üåïüåïüåï  But, seriously, is it normal to take a week?

Stimulus checks wont pass until threat of squeeze is over
Hedge funds have convinced the government that if they give out the stimulus checks now it will all be used to squeeze the bear nuts. Think about it, every person needs at least $5000. $1400 doesn't do shit for people after a year. But if fucking the hedgies is all over the news when everyone gets the stimmy its a no brainer. And you best believe me when I say we live in a country where half the people are fucking morons.   Release the stimmies!  Flair should be shit post. Im depressed from losing all my money and feel like a smooth brain.
Why I am holding-and you may want to
$gme   Recap.   ‚Ä¢Melvin/hedge funds short GameStop. Twice.   ‚Ä¢Xbox/Microsoft GM becomes acting GME CEO-   ‚Ä¢Chewy founder CEO buys in/submits prospectus to Board regarding GME transformation Microsoft/GameStop collaboration is announced  ‚Ä¢‚û°Ô∏è  it was held back that they get revenue from partnership with Xbox game pass  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚Ä¢  Now-we also have Elon and Mark weighing   in with expert advice (hey-I‚Äôm not a millionaire so they know more than me)   And add in the market crashing, silver spambots, margins canceled, social media shut downs and all of a sudden limit buying in shares the day after all time highs.   Very. Suspicious. To say the least.   next?    We know what‚Äôs next.   GME magically recovers as the darling of Wall Street while we got manipulated again.   But. The story takes a turn. Billboards start appearing across the country. Melvin can‚Äôt take a drive to the local Wendy‚Äôs anymore without seeing ‚ÄúGME to the moon‚Äù. Finland buys in. Saudia Arabia buys in. Japan buys in. The mother f@cking Times Square has GME to the moon lit up for the world to see.   This is uncharted territory here folks. I know what Wall Street wants to happen. The media is pumping it right now. They have DFV in their beady sights. They want to see us fall. Again.  But. It‚Äôs a new world. 2008 and the VW short squeeze didn‚Äôt have Twitter. 2008 didn‚Äôt have an army of the working class sitting at their computers figuring out that Wall Street is not the God like money figure we have been told to be believe. The reality is that the Hedge Funds that ‚Äúprotect‚Äù peoples retirement are really just going off of insider knowledge and the ability to manipulate the market in mass.   It‚Äôs not 2008 anymore. I think the world has it right and they see that WSB/DFV made a damn wise call. They are the ones trying to hold the share price up every day facing down the hedge funds with sheer determination to be validated and paid.   What they have attempted to do is criminal. It‚Äôs not 2008.  The world is legitimately watching and showing support in this in a way I don‚Äôt think anybody expected. Especially in 2021.   I‚Äôm holding. I don‚Äôt want to. This isn‚Äôt an example of my normal trading-having every single trick used against you.. to the point that it‚Äôs simply pure lunacy that we are witnessing.  To actually want to question a member of WSB for market manipulation. Seriously.  I cannot in good faith sell and leave everyone standing alone trying to do the right thing. Ive already lost the money.  My retail money did the DD. They just cheated.  Adding-I am a simple monkey and do not give stock advice.
Sweet Loss Porn
Turned 1k into 12k in a month! Then I turned 12k into 3k in a week.         GME     AMC      I'm holding through February
Popeyes is promoting our STONKS
Is AMC a sideshow, or does it really have a shot here? I mostly only see WSB clones talking about it.
I missed the boat on GME, and found 200, 300+ too much of a risk, but I was curious about AMC. I'm not much of a   what's the deal here? I have a sinking suspicion that it's a distraction being propagated by WSB clones hoping for something that doesn't have a chance of really blowing up, and now the bots and trolls are desperately trying to pump it up to further distract from GME. I'm a retard, so I'd appreciate a concise explanation or two.
Best guestimate when the AMC Squeeze is gonna happen
As of now, my understanding is everyday the suites don't cover their shorts they are paying interest. I've seen numbers across the board of interest being very significant. I have also seen shorts closing all week with significant amounts closing Thursday.   My question is when is a solid guestimate when Wall Street gets sick of paying their interest and begin to buy the stocks back up, which should shoot the price wayyy up.
What donyou think will happen to NOKIA after the earnings?
I'm HOLDING.....
because I CAN'T FUCKING READ NUMBERS GOOD. Does this mean I win the stock market yet?
How do we know the hedges haven't already covered their positions?
Serious question.   If they cover their positions and buy low, wouldn't another trip to the moon work in their favor?
Will brokers/dealers be ever forced to deliver shares?
I‚Äôm wondering if anyone in finance can tell me this. It seems pretty much 100% evident there was a lot of naked short selling on GME. This isn‚Äôt even up for dispute at this time.   Question is, will they ever be forced to deliver the shares or can they delay indefinitely? Seems to me if there is any force to deliver lots of brokers will be screwed, but if not then all you guys holding are screwed. So it‚Äôs really down to SEC enforcing this.  Edit: what if all longs request a physical stock certificate from GameStop will that have any effect?
HONG KONG LOVE GME!
Other stocks/full retard.
People posting other stuff in here but I literally can't read. So I'm just buying and holding GME
We like the receipt!

The worst loss in my investing history
But also my greatest investment.     If the criminals are still holding onto their shorts, then the money they are losing in interest satisfies me more than any gain I could've made. I just wanted to be a part of the foot that went up Wall St's ass; I will hold forever as a memento.
Riddle me this $GME
While we think we have this figured out, the HFs on Wall St. have some big brains too.   While I think we have power and we are holding strong, what makes you think other HFs didn‚Äôt see the squeeze play (and an opportunity for massive gains and to put another HF out of business) and are sitting on millions of shares with no intent of selling?  They have smart people, they have access to more data, much more capital, and they know how this works. The next two weeks should paint a pretty clear picture and I think those holding are in a better spot than they think.   It‚Äôs not just the retail investors that have a vested interest in this. The hedgies want a bigger yacht than the dudes a block over and they want more AUM than their competitors.  Right?       Not investment advice, ate a box of Crayola 64 for dinner.
What are you looking to get from the short squeeze?
Hi, gang. Just an ape here looking to mush my brain and get some folds going.  I‚Äôve been reading about a bunch of scenarios where the squeeze can take off and people make money when the shorts give up. I‚Äôve also read a few opposing views. What‚Äôs the score if you don‚Äôt make money? I‚Äôm just trying to understand the eagerness of people on this thread.  Are you trying to get rich quick or save GameStop? Be a part of something bigger than yourself? Sorry, if I‚Äôm too dumb to ask, but I am curious.  I don‚Äôt hold any GME, but I beat my monke chest for y‚Äôall
Hold!!!!!
No matter what‚Äôs happening the correct term is HOLD!! I still have all my original shares. This is Hail Mary time I‚Äôm holding!! 700 shares of $AMC and 37 of $GME.      !! <~~~ this is us! I will be holding for at least another few weeks.   Not legal advice, I‚Äôm just an Ape trying to go to the moon. It‚Äôs your money and you have to do what‚Äôs right for you.
I HAVE NO HOPE, it gives me HOPE! Let me give you hope!!     üí™
Listen my fellow     I am a long timer lurker joined early Jan 2020. I was amazed and loved this place dearly and will always enjoy the waves we go through. I started making vaccine plays when corona hit, then my best play SPY PUTS printed tendies! Pandemic! The economy and world going to shit I LOVED it! I was late to Tesla couldnt afford it but I was happy I‚Äôm making money on wayy OTM puts and the world is going to shit! I took some money out, a lot of money for myself but pennies for most and but that shit made my year. I took the rest and puts where printing then PRINTER GO BRRRRRRR üíµüíµüíµüíµüíµ v shape recovery ALLL TIME HIGHS! I was given the good ole dickins and my account hit $4. No moral left I said I‚Äôll see ya later. I was left in the dust because the people who run this game just print money and prop anything they want up. I‚Äôve seen a lot of gains and losses. I see the mentality we have here some have risk management and some people have no understanding of how you do not yolo on margin. Some average   some retard   some pure autist  . No one cares about what you think, politic views, who you fuck, who your wife‚Äôs boyfriend is. We just want to make money. Now this is a üé¢ of ups and downs it can take a lot out of you. You know what really takes a lot out of you. All the FAMILIES CRUSHED by the 2008 crash. All the banks that get bailed out, alll the hedge funds that get bailed out. Robinhood choosing to give you the üçÜ and all the market manipulations. These greedy fucks are the same people who pay powers to suppress every single thing in this world that is out to put you down. Keeping your wage shit, technologies suppressed because it would hurt other industries. These people cheat, lie, and take everything they can get there hands on while we slave working out life‚Äôs away to survive! Then we play there game and they fuck us hard. Honestly between the politics that i don‚Äôt care about. How hard it is to live on a full time job by yourself, the healthcare system. How if your poor it‚Äôs so much harder to afford to eat healthy. Climate change bullshit. God damn Epstein. Corona, a lifetime of living in a world with constant war. Protest and shit in the capital. Like this word is fucked. My life is basically a joke and a meme. Take whatever you want from me I will           my 133 shares of GameStop untill i sell 100 for $1000+ and keep the rest because I LIKE THIS STOCK or NEVER sell. At this point all you shorts are wrong even if they illegally stop the squeeze because GameStop has restructured, GameStop has publicity, and GameStop now has a even bigger following. Also the squeeze has not yet been squoze, look at daily short interest, short ladder attacks are real. The games manipulated. If they were not in harms way you wouldn‚Äôt see all the FUD. They would stop talking about if and stop spreading false information about the subreddit. Fuck them. I HATE YOU ALL WITH A BURNING PASSION!! I CAN LOSE THOUSANDS JUST TO MAKE YOU LOSE MILLIONS DAY BY DAY. THIS. IS. WAR.        üí™       TL:DR 90% of life is shit anyways so there is no hope, they manipulate the market and do whatever they want. The squeeze has not been squoze! my only hope is that if I go down YOU COME DOWN WITH ME. HOLD THE LINE.             üí™üí™
Heelppp!!
Guys i heard about the gamestop thing and i wanted to try stocks because of that thing but the problem here is that i literally dunno nothing about stock and i need your help!
GME share count

RETARDS IF WE HOLD WE WIN.....
MAYBE NOT TODAY OR   WE WIN!!!!  DONT BE A FAKE AUTIST LIKE THESE FAKE RETARD PAPER HAND PORTNOYS.
You guys are what keeps me going
Probably gonna get deleted but still, just wanted to say that. Im a new retard monke that only could afford 2 shares.  Once the price started going down, I panicked and almost sold everything. I was only a click away. Almost paped handed my way out like a scared baby monke.  But I remembered everyone here. I remembered DFV losing tens of millions and still holding. Hundreds of people buying. Thousands of stupid freaking apes blindly trusting each other.  So now, when I doubt this whole thing, I just go through this reddit for 10 minutes and my resolve comes back. I read the motivationals posts, the crazy conspiracies and the dumb ape non financial advice. I read why are we doing this and all the people who are with me.   You f-ing bastards. I love you.   Keep it up. To the moon.
Main goal
I rarely post but I‚Äôve seen this stuff going around trying to make us mistrust the community and the person that moderates this chat. I‚Äôm not sure if any of it is true but it‚Äôs just an archived post with no backing from what I‚Äôve seen. Remember the main goal and hold the line. The only way hedge funds beat us is physiological warfare to make us sell our share. They will pull anything to achieve this goal I‚Äôm not sure if most of the stuff on here is facial but what I do know is as long as we hold those shorts are stuck.      This is not financial advise
GME and why do we matter
I  fling poop and drag my knuckles on the floor.  I am not a financial  advisor.  Do your own due diligence.  This is for entertainment purposes  only.  Lately,  I've felt like we don't have a voice and don't matter but I want to  remind all us apes that we are retarded together.  We will win TOGETHER  and we will HOLD together.  Could be days, weeks, or months.  Longer  than any of our attention spans.  So they will use TIME against us.  BUT  time is on our side.  This is  psychological warfare against us to make us DOUBT ourselves and what we  WILL accomplish.  We will remain retarded longer then they can remain  solvent.  They bleed interest each day.  A stock's value is based upon  what we place on it.  See TSLA for reference.  WE LIKE THE FUCKING  STOCK.  If my stock is worth 5k to me, I WILL HOLD for 5 fucking K.  WHO  are you to tell us how to perceive VALUE?  OHHHHH, you're an expert who  got caught with your dick in the cookie jar (thx louis rossman).   SHORTING 130-140% of a stock.  These hedgies aren't infallible.  Just  well connected and well resourced.  As long as we own shares that they  NEED, we have time on our side.  Even though it will not feel like it.  Obligatory, don't invest what you can't lose.  We  cannot let the hedgies deter us.  Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don't matter.  We don't know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn't have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.  LOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It's our $, let us do what  we want with it.  If a hedgie can irresponsibly short a stock over  100%, why can't we take a CALCULATED risk?  BUUUT funDamentAls.   Gamestop is a dying company.  The former business model of GME is dying.   As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I've never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He's  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.  How about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people's money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it's little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can't, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that's because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  Yet, we are not allowed to exploit the law  of supply and demand.  If the demand exceeds 100% of the supply, the  inherit value ROCKETS.  See RTX cards and AMD chips.  FUCK SCALPERS for  good measure :)  I want to remind  every single one of you, we do matter.  We have NUMBERS on our side.  As  a collective we've already made shorting a topic of conversation at the  political level.  This may not be a monetary victory but it hopefully  is a step in the right direction to a more equal game.  That or hold  your politicians accountable.  You are their constituents.  We  play out in the open.  We share publicly available information and make  decisions base.  Really, it's just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.  It prints $$$$ BRRrrrrr.  Let's recap how the odds are stacked against us.  \-We  are too stupid to be allowed to spend our money.  We need government  intervention to "protect us".  The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can't decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.  \-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they're  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn't  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.  \-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.  \-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they're not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.  \-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them   time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.  Anyways, I could  keep bitching but I just wanted to vent and rally us together.  We took  a mad beating. I just wanted to let you beautiful online strangers that  you aren't alone.  GME has transcended and has evolved into a movement.  What  does GME mean to me?  A down-payment to a home for my family and I.  My  wife and I are expecting our first kid.  I'm risking something I can  lose... for a better future.  What does GME mean to you?  TLDR; We fucking matter.  We are going to be the catalyst of change. HOLD SHARES. Don't risk what you can't lose. APE Strong.  üí™

SVF Investment Group. Good Play?
SVF Investment Corp. is a special purpose acquisition company formed to enable a technology company to list publicly in close partnership with SoftBank Investment Advisers (SBIA), the investment manager to the SoftBank Vision Funds.   I found this stock while doing some research. Seems like a decent leadership board. Has a pretty low float for such a new stock. Might be something for ya'll to check out. Decent price too.

Search for a new platform
Hi all,  Since Robinhood's gone to hell and taken most of you all with it, has anyone had any luck with other trading platforms? I'm looking for recommendations.  Currently on eToro but it doesn't allow for trading of options and ideally I'm looking for a platform that has a rock solid mobile app to go with it so I can track and trade on the move.  Thanks,

A moment of honesty  Real shit, thank you to the mods. (The real ones)  I'm incredibly green to this sub, investing and Reddit in general; and from the start I was blown away at how effortlessly the mods performed this hypnotic dance along the line of diligent professional/vile heathen. Outfuckingstanding... At the same time, I instantly fell in love with the roasting, bashing and self deprecating humor that absolutely envelops this sub. As a Marine vet and firefighter with 10+ years in the service, I assure you, your shit talking is top fucking tier. The first time scrolling through this sub, I could feel my eyes watering up as I asked myself, "Where have you beautiful bastards been all my life??" (Just kidding, I cant read) I've only read a handful of accounts about what this group used to be and we all know it is forever changed, but I hope you apes manage to hold onto this amazing clusterfuck you've created. I hope to see it return to some level of normalcy or something greater some day, cause I AIN'T FUCKIN LEAVIN!!!  I'm still praying Tom Brady throws DFVs golden cock into the endzone tomorrow at market open or whatever it is that needs to happen, but for now; I'll take the L. I'll hold the bag. Because I gambled with money I could afford to lose. I couldn't count how many times I saw members warn people not to invest more than you can afford to lose and yet here we are, with people penniless (allegedly) and in absolute shock that this crazy idea didn't pan out (yet üòâ) Worst case scenario, I paid for a crash course in capitalism. I basically have a business degree from a community college now. What a wild transformation this month was, from dabbling on RH (twats) to opening several accounts and throwing thousands of dollars into the chaos.  Anyway, I just wanted to stick some daggers into the system and each one cost me over $200. But it was fucking worth it. About as expensive as a rough weekend in Vegas but with 10 times the entertainment and 100 times the memories. Win or lose, we were a part of history. I'd rather be a retarded ape on the field than prodigy in the stands. 10 years from now, Johnny Shmuckatelli will barely remember what went down this week, but I'll be fisting my wife's boyfriend and he'll scream in agony as he remembers... Iv'e still got diamond fucking hands.  BANG GANG 4 LYFE DFH   ü§òü§ò
Alright you little bitches
You need momma to come in and put the band aid on the bullet hole?  Fine.  Stop buying $GME.  Stop holding $GME.  It‚Äôs over.  Don‚Äôt hate on DVF- he cradled you like a baby long enough.  Time to cut your loses and move on.  This ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù martyrdom is noble but sad.  Pull your money.  There‚Äôs a voice here and it roars when triggered!  Use that.  Lick your wounds from this battle and take that rally cry into the next one!  Wars are fought and won over time, not in a single day, trade, or week.  Retreat and collect yourselves.  Prepare with the knowledge learned and come back stronger.
GME, synergetic longs, failure to delivers, reversals, resetting the clock, and you
II. Option Activity Related to Hard to Borrow and/or Threshold Securities One strategy that could be designed to take advantage of the potential profit opportunities created by a stock becoming hard-to-borrow (thereby putting the Put/Call Parity into imbalance) is to initiate a Reversal. The activity is most often done by broker-dealers who claim to rely on the exception to the locate requirement for options market makers found in Rule 203(b)(2)(iii).24 The options market-makers claim that they can enter into the short stock position without first locating the shares to borrow because it is part of ‚Äúbona fide‚Äù market making activity. Although an options market maker engaged in bona fide market making activity may claim an exception to the locate requirement, to comply with Reg SHO, the options market maker must still deliver shares in settlement of the short sale, or if a fail to deliver position results at the clearing firm, the fail to deliver must be closed-out in accordance with Rule 204 of Reg SHO. It may be a violation of Regulation SHO, however, where the options market maker does not deliver shares, and instead engages in a second, subsequent transaction in order to give the appearance of satisfying the clearing firm‚Äôs obligation to purchase or borrow the security to close out the resulting settlement fail pursuant to Rule 204 close-out requirements (‚Äúreset transaction‚Äù). In addition, where a clearing firm subject to the close-out requirement purchases or borrows securities on the applicable close-out date and on that same date engages in sale transactions that can be used to re-establish or otherwise extend the clearing firm‚Äôs fail position, and for which the clearing firm is unable to demonstrate a legitimate economic purpose, the clearing firm will not be deemed to have satisfied the close-out requirement. Moreover, if the clearing firm or broker-dealer that was allocated the fail to deliver position enters into an arrangement with another person to purchase securities as required by Rule 204, and the clearing firm, or broker-dealer that was allocated a fail to deliver position, knows or has reason to know that the other person will not deliver securities in settlement of the purchase, then the transaction is a sham close-out, in violation of Rule 204(f). The Initial Transaction Example: ‚Ä¢ Stock XYZ trading $  ‚Ä¢ May 50 Puts on XYZ trading $  ‚Ä¢ May 50 Calls on XYZ trading $  Trader A: Sells 10,000 shares XYZ @ $  Buys 100 May 50 Calls @ $  Sells 100 May 50 Puts @ $  In this example, the ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù position is trading for $50, which is simply Call Price - Put Price + Strike Price. The actual shares are trading for $51, so that Trader A has effectively sold shares for $1 more than it paid for them, in a simultaneous transaction. Each time the trade is made, Trader A is earning a $100 profit26, assuming that (a) Trader A is not being charged a fee to borrow shares to deliver on the short sale and (b) the clearing firm does not effect a buy-in against the trader to close-out a fail to deliver   In this case, the trade was made 100 times, so that the profit would be $10,000. The sole reason for the disparity between the actual shares and the ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù position is the fact that the shares of XYZ are hard to borrow. The Second Transaction to ‚ÄúReset the Clock‚Äù Assuming that XYZ is a hard to borrow security, and that Trader A, or its broker-dealer, is unable (or unwilling28) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of Short term FLEX   These trades are commonly referred to as ‚Äúreset transactions,‚Äù in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. The buy-writes may be (but are not always) prearranged trades between market- makers or parties claiming to be market makers. The price in these transactions is determined so that the short seller pays a small price to the other market-maker for the trade, resulting in no economic benefit to the short seller for the reset transaction other than to give the appearance of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement   Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm‚Äôs responsibility to close out a failure to   Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position. These circumstances vary. For example, Trader A may be engaging in buy-writes with a known counterparty, such as another market maker (Trader B) that Trader A pays to take the other side of its reset transactions. In this circumstance, Trader A and Trader B agree on a price at which the buy-write will be transacted. The trade is consummated as a spread, with the stock and option portions executed at the same time. Trader A sells calls to Trader B, and Trader A buys shares from Trader B. The size of the trade is dictated by how many shares Trader A is required to deliver to appear to have closed out the settlement fail arising from his short position and avoid a buy-in or large borrowing fees. Trader A knows or has reason to know that the counterparty to the buy-write will not deliver securities in settlement of the transaction. Rather, on the same day of the buy-write, Trader B will, in almost every case, exercise the deep in-the- money options it bought from Trader A in order to eliminate the short position created by selling shares to Trader A in the buy-write transaction, negating Trader A‚Äôs purchase of those shares. The two counterparties trade deep in-the-money calls with little to no open interest, so that Trader A knows that when Trader B exercises its calls, Trader A will be the one assigned32 on the exercised calls. As a result of the assignment on the exercised calls, Trader A has another delivery obligation. Trader A, or its broker-dealer, remains unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery, and the reset transaction may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm. The result may be a persistent fail to deliver position in the security at issue. Trader A may also be engaging in buy-writes with unknown counterparties, but structured in a way that Trader A knows or has reason to know that the calls will be consistently exercised and assigned to Trader A. In particular, Trader A‚Äôs buy-writes involve deep in-the-money calls on hard to borrow securities with little to no open interest. The end result is very likely the same: Trader A, or its broker-dealer, remains unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery on the assignment of the exercised calls, and the repeated reset transactions result in a persistent fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm in the security at issue. To the broker-dealer or clearing firm, it may appear that Trader A‚Äôs purchase, in the buy-write, has allowed the broker-dealer to satisfy its close-out requirement. Trader A continues to execute a buy-write reset transaction whenever necessary, and by the time of expiration of its original Reversal, it may have given up some of the profits in the form of premiums paid for the buy- writes, but it has maintained its short position without paying the higher cost to borrow or purchase shares to make delivery on the short sale. In each buy-write transaction, Trader A is aware that the deep in-the-money options are almost certain to be exercised (barring a sudden huge price drop), and it fully expects to be assigned on its short options, thus eliminating its long shares.  Taken from:    I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and try to convince you apes I‚Äôm a financial guru or anything of the sort. Just a retard with an affinity for gambling. But this SEC memo from 2013 seems to be describing exactly what we are seeing here. They may never have to cover their short completely outright now that they have a grip on the situation. Not sure what this could mean for us moving forward, but feels very relevant.

GME second short squeeze questions
Hey guys just wondering its more than likely that the hedge funds have closed their short positions by now and are better prepared but just wondering if they did close their short positions then what about the positions at 8 to 60 dollars per share. Also if they did make new short positions which they most likely did to cover their losses, what are the chances of the new short positions being at 200 dollars per share downwards to 90. If so isn't it possible for another rally for a squeeze?   Also another question is if fintras report with the numbers come out on the 9th. Don't the hedgies know this and will try their best to tank this stock by then?   Just some questions I would like some answers to even if they may seem dumb. After all I am a retard.

U/jb4gdi Game design
Originally from : u/jb4gdi    I am NOT original author Give any and all awards to that guy. He‚Äôs a fucking a game designer and sees shit I don‚Äôt.   Dearest mods <3  I'm trying to get this post approved (  but I am being blocked.  Here it is for anyone that stumbles onto this thing I put an insane amount of time into.  Meme Stocks, The Infinite Game, and How the Game has Changed the Players  Pre-pandemic WSB member with Asperger's here ‚Äì I have designed stupid board games and video games for years, and while I have spent a ton of time watching what's going on and thinking about everything, I was suddenly reminded about the game design concept of "Finite and Infinite Games." It's worth viewing the current situation under this lens and I wanted to shine some light on how this game design concept factors into meme stocks, and what everyone (including myself) has missed until today.  All of this is my opinion. It is not a recommendation or financial advice or a call to action even if it looks like it. My positions are long GME and NOK in small amounts because I am poor, but I got in super early on both so I have no plans to sell.  Finite and Infinite Games  For those that have never heard of this, it comes from a book with the same name (yes I can read) and even smoothbrains can understand the main idea:  Finite games have a clear end and the purpose of a player is to win. Football is a finite game. Monopoly is a finite game. Getting your stock to a certain target price and selling is a finite game.  Infinite games do not have a clear end, and the purpose of a player is to stay in the game longer than the opponent. The game can even outlast the players. Running a business is an infinite game. Exploration is an infinite game. The Cold War was an infinite game.  When finite-minded players enter a finite game, or when infinite-minded players enter an infinite game, the game functions properly. But things get wild when a player sits down at the wrong game.  The Vietnam War  I'm stealing this section from the beginning of Simon Sinek's incredible talk because I am lazy and it fits the point I'm trying to make.  The US got into the Vietnam War to win a war. If the enemy ended up flying a white flag, victory is achieved and uhhh, freedom. They were playing to win the game (finite-mindset) and they won a lot of battles. But the Vietnamese were fighting for their lives and their way of life. Their goal was to get the other player to drop out or simply outlast the opposition until they left (which the US did). And the Vietnamese were willing to fight to the last man to do it.  The United States won a ton of battles but the Vietnamese won the war.  What type of game is the stock market?  We can answer this a lot of ways but my simplest take is this: the stock market is a weird beast because it's an infinite game (outlast your opponents) but most people play with a finite mindset: A player tries to get their stock to hit a certain target price, and they cash out (win) and leave or play again (pick a new stock).  During the past few weeks, a tremendous amount of players entered the meme stock game and used orders and limits to win so they could leave. Their opponents did the same.  Even when the rules are lopsided, the game functions as both sides (üêÉ vs.   ) try to cheerlead and do whatever they can to fight for their side, short or long.  üìâ Enter Robinhood üìâ  It's no secret that last Thursday, the rules of the game drastically changed for players in meme stocks, as millions of players were suddenly knocked out, impacting the score for every other player. Demand is directly linked to price.  By artificially collapsing demand during one of the biggest bull runs in history, a referee (Robinhood) essentially robbed all the players on one side of the game to benefit the opposing players. This is why there was a sudden and immediate outpouring of powerful people from all angles condemning the action. The referee broke the game (meme stocks fall because the demand is suppressed) and no timeout was called.  How finite-minded players adjusted  Players of the finite game that got robbed now came to a crossroads. They could  1.	‚Å†Hold and keep playing (  ), hoping their meme stock would hit their target price 2.	‚Å†Cut their losses and sell ( ü§ö) to keep a smaller profit or prevent deeper losses  The players that were benefited by the shakedown also had a choice. And that choice looked different because of their advantage:  1.	‚Å†Stay with the meme stocks, hoping to get their stock to the target price or better 2.	‚Å†Cash out, and maybe move to other stocks immediately because holy God this meme stock well is poisoned and the volatility is insane  At the end of the day, all these players are looking to cash out at a number, so even though they are on different sides, and meme stocks are crazy right now, the game is still playable.  If you haven't fallen asleep yet, here is the part where things go off the rails and no one is talking about it because no one has put the right words to it yet. A HUGE NUMBER of these finite-minded players have been turned into infinite-minded players  .    Through the cacophony of all you paste-eating morons yelling at each other, I have noticed some major changes in the way people are talking about their meme stocks since Thursday:  ‚Ä¢	‚Å†"Food S  or Lambos. GME to the moon." ‚Ä¢	‚Å†"Do I die with NOK or get Cremated with NOK?" ‚Ä¢	‚Å†"I'm holding AMC until they make a movie about us"  All of these are hilarious. But there is something deeper going on psychologically with these people, and it is clear to me that they have changed from a finite-mindset to an infinite mindset. Let me break it down.  When these players got robbed, it instilled in them a righteous desire for justice.  I'm sure a bunch of them are familiar with The Big Short, or were connected to the 2008 housing market crisis, and they're all aware of how these things happen at the expense of the common man and no one gets punished.  In their minds, the only path forward now is to get revenge by putting the game back on its original path, through their sheer force of will. They will die playing this game, and they cannot be reasoned or argued with. Maybe they still have a target price in mind, but I need to be even more clear:  These infinite-minded players are working to get the other players to drop out and they are not leaving  Remember that Vietnam War analogy I used earlier? Right now, finite-minded players who only care about the target price of a meme stock are simply looking to win. But the converted, infinite-minded players are playing the long game, and while they may have limited resources (the Vietnamese were completely outgunned and outnumbered), you will only be able to these people from their position when they win.  üìà What does this mean üìà  I'd be lying if I said I knew, but I can wildly speculate for the rest of this post, which I will do and you will listen.  The market is always trying to achieve equilibrium, but what we are seeing is a motion to achieve rules equilibrium. These players were cheated, so they have created their own set of rules to play by: buy and hold. While these players may be small in number, they are going to quietly drain the supply without anyone noticing.  The floor for these meme stocks is going to continue to rise, and these players will continue to get people on board and things are going to snowball. At some point they will attract the attention of people with real money who believe in their pursuit of justice. And unlike the squeeze we started to see last week, the supply and demand curve is going to be so out of whack, you are going to see squeezes that will blow your   minds.                Even if these people lose they win                Imagine for a moment that GME collapses to $20 a share. Maybe the next quarter financials are abysmal. Do you think for a moment that these people aren't going to be dumping every single dollar they have into it? This will be like Christmas to them, because GME is not an investment in their minds, it's a ticket for their cause. It's the path to revenge.  What about if anything bad happens to DFV after he's pulled into a congressional hearing? These people know that it's not smart to storm the capital. They're attacking where it matters and they're using their money.  Some of these people saw what their position was at $480. It was staring them in the face and it was going up. They watched it plummet in real time. Can you imagine the level of conviction these people have? Do you think the hedge funds or even the other players have this level of steadfastness? These people have diamond hearts.  I'll say it again: If someone with a lot of money is smart enough to notice all this, the nuclear bomb of a broken supply and demand curve is going to explode, making these infinite-minded players rich, and demolishing those with weaker backbones. We might lose a chunk of the market each time one of these nukes goes off.  Personally I don't think we're ever going back to $20 for GME. I'm shocked that it's even close to $90 right now. But the truth of the matter is this:  The infinite-minded players have divorced meme stock price from the financials and it will be that way until we reach a point where the game resets to where it was on Thursday  This may take days, weeks, months, or years to get there for some of the meme stocks, but it doesn't matter because these people have invented their own rules and there are more players in that position than you or I think. The media will eventually stop talking about these meme stocks, assuming people have walked away, but these people have found their cause and they will be committed to it until their wrong is righted. And they are literally willing to die trying.   üíÄ  Please, please, PLEASE be aware of this. The mindset of a large number of players has shifted almost overnight and they have chosen their battlefield. None of their opponents are fighting the game at their level. And throughout history, when infinite-minded players have played an infinite game against finite-minded players, the infinite-minded players have won. They have won every, single, time.

Every great decision or terrible failure required some levels of fear and risk. It's a BET. One that is bigger than you.
Sorry for being stupid here, but I'm seeing far too many members getting emotional here. A lot are new. Welcome to the club.  Yeah, I get it. You might be in for crazy levels of money right now, but YOU are the one that put yourself in that position. Nobody forced you to BUY or SELL.  The stock market is a gamble. Always has been, always will be. You went into this KNOWING the risks, so if you were dense enough to put so much into it that you're risking financial ruin, that's nobody's fault but your own.   You have my well wishes of luck in the future, but you don't have my sympathies if things don't pan out for you. The stock market has destroyed far more lives than your own. It's also has been a lifesaver on the exact flip side.  We take these risk to make gains. Some go long. Some short-term. It's a gamble. Have faith in the bet. Support those in the same boat as you. You'll face either good times together or crushing blows. Perhaps both.  WSB is just a discussion hub. Statistically, most of us are stupid newbies stumbling around in the dark. Even the oldest members don't have much more of a grasp of the situation other than how to use the tools.  Be excellent to each other. Don't be afraid to ask questions.  This community is still great and the mods are kicking ass right now under all this crazy hubbub.  Best of luck, and as always,   üèª.  "This is for entertainment purposes only.

Will GME be the next Tesla?
Tesla was the original short squeeze. They traded pretty low for a long time but then improved fundamentals very slightly and their stock skyrocketed. Then they did a stock split in August 2020 and got added to the SP500 in December. Now their stock is trading at stratospheric levels.  GME has already taken over WSB, much like Tesla had done. Now they have Cohen, and if fundamentals improve only slightly, then stocks could skyrocket, forcing a stock split and SP500 inclusion. Thus GME could be trading just as high as Tesla at trillion dollar valuations.  Disclosure- I sold my Tesla stocks and own GME. Past GME performance is not indicative of future GME performance. I also have a diversified portfolio and encourage safe financial decisions.

Why WSB is getting investigated by the SEC and how it relates to WSB ‚Äúculture‚Äù vs. the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù
I‚Äôve lurked here for a year or two. I never really posted until the GME event. I‚Äôm holding my bag with pride, knowing I put my money where my mouth is on a cause I view as important. (600 gme @ $   A lot of people here are angry to hear the SEC is investigating this sub. After the massive level of bullshit we‚Äôve seen these past few weeks in the media and the markets, I was pissed, too.   But then I started looking through various GME ‚Äúdiamond hands movement‚Äù posts tonight and almost every one had someone saying ‚Äúthere is no movement, there was never a movement, we are here just to make money.‚Äù If I were y‚Äôall I would think twice about making that claim for a couple reasons.   First, if that‚Äôs true, your mod team permitted a falsified movement to be promoted here just for the sake of manipulating the market so a select few of this subs users could be enriched by said movement. And any of you paper hands who were promoting it just to pump your own earnings were too. It would have been very easy for the mods to start mass bans and for y‚Äôall to downvote  anything  related to an economic movement, but that never happened.. I wonder why ü§î  Second, your sub absolutely chose to become home to a movement whether you signed off on it or not. DFV did not intend to start a movement, that‚Äôs 100% true. He‚Äôs just a dude with the right combo of smarts, luck, and capital. He has nothing to do with this.   It‚Äôs this community i am taking about. At this point, the number of people who joined the sub during this event out numbers native citizens.. by  a lot.  The mod team saw what was happening and chose not to ban talk of said movement. Many of you who are now gleefully ripping on GME holders (of bags, myself included) took part in the festivities as well. WSB bent over the barrel for these new idealistic investors faster than a $12 whore.   So here‚Äôs ultimately where you stand: you sold your sub out to a shit ton of normies just so a few of you could make some money and as a result you  may have actually engaged in active market manipulation.   You either accept that there‚Äôs a lot of economically pissed off people here who are trying to figure out how to make money while sticking it to the man, or you enjoy getting deep donged by the SEC. maybe both!   Either way, WSB as you knew it is 100% dead. You killed it with a meme stock. Congratulations. It‚Äôs a new sub now, and you old idiots don‚Äôt own it anymore cuz there are way more of the newbies than there are of you.   Enjoy all the normies hanging around, I guess.   Tl;dr: WSB isn‚Äôt the WSB you used to know and love. That WSB is dead forever. Get used to it. And maybe quit punching down on people who came here to invest in an ideal. It‚Äôs bad karma, and the SEC is taking note.
Not much, but I‚Äôll hold the line all the way to the FUCKING MOON    Let‚Äôs go baby!   AMC

APHA Shareholder Vote Date?
Hello Retards, Fucktards, & Wives' Boyfriends,  Made some nice tendies in last 2 weeks off GME and NAKD plays. Now in APHA for an options play...    Positions: APHA $19c 2/19   (which I may even roll further out - TBD).  I'm bullish, at the very least, on the run-up to the merger expected in Q2 ( . However, I realize this is ultimately subject to shareholder vote. Given that the reverse merger is architected to prevent dilution of existing shares, I don't expect it not to pass. Even so, I can't seem to find anything that indicates when exactly that vote is expected except this statement from APHA website's merger FAQ page...   Do I get to vote on the transaction?    Yes, you will have a chance to vote on the transaction at a meeting of shareholders. The transaction must be approved by at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Aphria shareholders. Full details of the transaction will be included in a management information circular of Aphria to be mailed to Aphria Shareholders in the coming weeks.   Obviously, this passing would ensure myself and other APHA bulls don't get rugpulled AND perhaps might even lift the stock since so many here probably haven't priced it (  recent influx of newbies). Has anyone received this yet? If so, what date/time does the vote take place?  Thanks - and inb4: I'll go fuck myself in advance.

Let‚Äôs count our shares. PLEASE READ! üåñ
In advance, sorry for the wall of text. TLDR at the bottom: please take the time to read.  Shareholders are being attacked by HFs using the price of the stock. They are instilling fear for losing money on what many thought was a strong plan. The HFs know that the shareholder will be emotional about their holdings. They all have been there and they know what it feels like. We don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be where they are sitting. We don‚Äôt truly know if our actions are instilling fear in them. They are likely confident that they can break us. They are an organized company. We are a lightly organized group of random people. Our strategy is to hold. Their strategy is to break that hold. So they attack us. You come on to WSB to see that other people are holding still. You check to see if DFV and Mark Cuban are still telling us to hold.  We need to show them our numbers. Yeah, anyone can read the number of current members of WSB and if you sort by ‚ÄúNew‚Äù you can see the stream of loss porn for those who are   ü§ö  When we see a stream of people holding, it‚Äôs comforting. Let‚Äôs back that with data. We need a count of the number of shares that we collectively hold. If Melvin is trying to get our shares, we need to know how many we‚Äôre holding.   A poll or census needs to be distributed in order to take a count of what we‚Äôre working with. This works for a couple of reasons: we know what strength there is in our numbers and the public will see who we are as a group. I saw someone mention that if we all had 3 shares each, there would (at the time) be 21 million shares distributed among us. I hold 20 shares. DFV is still holding 50,500 as of his update earlier today. Do we have 10 million or do we have 60 million? Let‚Äôs find out. Vote this up so people can see this and we can have a discussion on the validity of this idea. Maybe people already have and I haven‚Äôt seen it.  I deeply hate the fucking financial system. I see it destroying the world. GameStop was a dream for my childhood. It‚Äôs honestly one of the only parts of my childhood I care to still hold onto. I love this stock and I hate the system that crushes individuals and families alike. I hate being a slave.  TLDR: Let‚Äôs take a poll to figure out how many stocks we hold as a group.
Petite portfolio gets smashed by hedge funds and holds! Hope y‚Äôall are enjoying the dips and the loss porn, GME and AMC to the moon   we‚Äôll be holding tomorrow, and then the next day, then the next day, then, then the next day and so so on stay strong my fellow retards!
A person willing to teach?
Alright so after sing what happened to GameStop and amc/gmc stocks I want to start investing in stocks/forex. Now I know people tell me it‚Äôs not easy and then ask for pay before showing me anything and I wanted to know is that the norm? If not can somebody ‚Äúteach‚Äù me, eventually if and when I do make money I will pay.   TLDR- need a teacher to teach stocks/forex Pretty please with the stock market crashing ontop
DeepFuckingValue at the congressional hearing: Your excellencies. So I noticed they went full retard with the shorts. Perhaps some seriously illegal shit. You don't go full retard unless you have fuck you money. I like the stock. .

Dear Apes, Astronauts, and Degenerates. I come today with a request
Hello r/wallstreetbets,  I'm making a little passion project based on what you all have been doing these past couple of weeks.  So I just wanted to reach out and see if anyone would be willing to do a short interview (15-25 minutes) sometime this or next week. No qualifications or prerequisites needed, just looking for some other perspectives. If anyone is interested, comment or message me.  \[No I don't work for the government, yes I can blur your face/ alter your voice upon request\] .   Otherwise, keep up the good work and keep GME headed towards the moon!
THE SMOKING GUN. SYNTHETIC LONGS BEING USED BY HEDGIES TO MANIPULATE THEIR EXPOSURE. PLEASE READ
If shorts have covered then why are they driving the price lower and lower? Every time their is any light they spend millions to drive the price right back down. They are still actively working to save their ass and these past 3 days they have been winning and changing the sentiment on WSB.   In my opinion SI% is still very high. Why is trading  still limited? Because the Market Makers, and the brokers could lose their ass if they opened the flood gates.  Shares are scarce because we are fuckin holding and the shorts cannot cover all of their shorts. Their goal is keep the price low and disguise true SI% until we get off the gas.     Very interesting perspective on the ladder attack going on:     ‚ÄúThere are at least two plausible explanations for GME short interest declining ‚Äî giving the appearance of hedge funds covering more than half their shorts ‚Äî even as the GME share price fell sharply alongside.  ...  The first explanation is that GME squeezers lost their discipline and broke ranks.  ...  In this second scenario, though, the hedge funds that are short ‚Äî with tens of billions of dollars on the line ‚Äî could have decided to play a high-stakes trick.  The trick would be: ‚ÄúMake it look like we‚Äôve covered our shorts when we really haven‚Äôt (because we can‚Äôt), so that short interest falls and the Reddit army gets demoralized, thus breaking the squeeze.‚Äù  The way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery in the options market.  The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.  The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù‚Äù

MONEY RECOVERY the easy way
For anyone who has lost some money and is looking for basically a 100% surefire way to recover, buy some of the ARKF July   calls.   They're currently around   to   and that fund has literally never had a down month. It averages 7 dollars a month gain and 6 months ago was sitting at 31 dollars or so, now its just touched 57ish.  We have 163 days or   months until july, so assuming it maintains its average we are looking at 7x5. 35ish dollars roughly to be sitting at 56+35=91 or so.   Even on a lowball its going to hit and is an easy double by march with 400% possibility by july if not more.

GME Long - Even Without a Squeeze
Many were maybe looking for the mother of all short squeezes when they YOLOd GME. Many others just like the stock. Maybe plenty of us are true believers in a long play at GME. Some just boarded the hype train. Now that we're all    together in this, I wanted to open this thread up so peeps to share why they like the stock. Maybe y'all have ideas of how to solve one or more issues holding GME back? Heck, maybe via proxy power we have the ability to add pressure and get some shit done. More likely I've strained my only remaining brain cell, but eh, it's probably fine.  As a former frontline grunt employee with GME, I know the customer base is broad and the core audience is heavily invested. There is an enduring emotional investment in the retailer and a strong brand recognition as a household name. Love and hate are both passionate possitions and that strong reaction to the brand name speaks to a unique positioning and strong potential ability to connect with the growing subcultures surrounding and supporting the brand to date. I'm still not sure about Sherman, but I'm completely thrilled to have fresh, relevant, and diverse faces on the board, especially Cohen and Reggie, to forge a better place in this space for GME over time.   GME has good cash flow, access to hard to get IP licenses, and solid relationships with vendor partners, but has struggled to find the brand identity and experience that could put it in the rabid-fanboy/fangirl/nongenderconformingfanperson level of companies in the broader ecosystem like AMD, Sony, Nintendo, <insert your favorite game developer/publisher>. Imagine if rather than, "we make technology affordable and simple," GME evolved its experience to become a holy church for gamers and gaming culture like the NYC Nintendo store or many Apple stores. It wouldn't take much, IMHO. The frontline staff's passion for the brand is already uniquely positioned for this to the point where I've heard many minimum wage earning employees tell me that it was their childhood dream job. Embrace that. Expand it.  That's where I see the company's opportunity to move from a "finite game" ideology to an "infinite game" mentality (credit: Simon Sinek). That is not so different from what Reggie helped to build and grow at Nintendo of America. Add that to Cohen being able to turn up the volume online via omnichannel and every storefront already being a mini distribution center. Add some level of profit sharing being announced with digital sales for this new console cycle. Squeeze or not, I like the stock.  TLDR; I like the stock. Share why you like the stock.  Edit: I'm a novice learning some shit and having fun, there is plenty of good DD but it is not here. This is an opinion an not financial advice.
MEMBERS. THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!!
With   members, it means no more small cap stocks. Play on fundamentals and everyone piles on. The stock will pop so high all will make a killing but no stock crash and many will not get burnt. For example, this pandemic knocked down a lot of stocks that will go back up very soon. Why not force them back up now before the Wallstreet jumps onboard and when they do, the stock will pop higher. That is how you play it smart with this much power so no one gets burnt.  CCL was previously above $60. It is at $20. Many Wallstreet investors jumped ship in 2020 waiting for a reversal and will be back. Beat them to the punch. The cruise ship has enough funds to avoid bankruptcy, has high demand and will start sailing at the end of May. Which means the stock will start popping. We don't wait, we jump aboard, push the price up to a reasonable level BUT below the prior highs. Then wallstreet jumps in which they will again, they will push it to its fundamental highs. While we walk away with profits. When the market corrects, hold.  I'll jump in with $200,000!
EXIT WALLSTREET
I'm thinking (AMC) the slow response of the SEC to act in the best interest OF ALL STOCK HOLDERS, (even providing a supposition a minority retail trades are to be blamed) That's a false narrative to presume the average investor were duped by (AMC) maybe a few, while professional licensed businesses manipulate the entire picture daily. Retail traders in this instance is made out to be a failure, (despite confidence in AMC) it's a con or a snake, even media I sow willing sold to their benefit as their corporate mob, to rape society. While the SEC instead act to negate the improper conduct of instrument holders as a third party interest AKA Hedge fund and in part brokers. The SEC announced two days ago they were looking to make sure retail trades were not manipulated, while allowing SEC LICENSED HEDGE FUNDS TO RAPE RETAIL TRADES driving the stock of AMC down 10% mid day but failed to initiate the SSR rule. Brokers being given the availability of Hedges for gain, and the SEC in allowing Hedges to short beyond market demand/capability until the resources were tuned on them. For what purpose such greed that risks the economic stability of the nation and global concerns? A promise to another form of investor?.....Equality my ass. What stance does the SEC now make to protect by what standard of investor? We know the numbers they don't lie at all. That's the undoing in the end game. The make in the end to the win game is facilitated by the SEC. I have an absolute despise of the SEC laziness, and perhaps incompetence. They are bought out useless by any definition. They are truly a meme or willfully hindering proper oversight, I vote the later. Should not the SEC now be held accountable (and be legally bind to recoup losses on behalf of all retail traders? without a specific fine other than being a proper legal award?) in regard to fines of hedge funds improper behaviors? Or does the SEC admit they allow irresponsible Hedge Funds to manipulate a supposed free market? IN THE END, WITHOUT RETAIL TRADERS HEDGE FUNDS LOSE BEEITCHES/funding UNIONIZE RETAIL TRADING. Correction a good percentage of hedge fund gains (3x) should be seized and distributed between stock holders. At peak in this point of Right. The the SEC is teaching and yes instructing retail investors to go with the flow, and when they do what happens to the hedge funds? they lose their bets, since no one is left in the retail trade to be opposed. Stupid arrogant, greedy fks.  There's a time and proper season for everything, take a fucking slight loss deserved or will end tomorrow. Retail traders aren't as dumb as you think, stock jockey fund your supposed way of making a living, remove them, and there's no cash, you already removed the vast majority of actual responsible earning.
Why is RH getting all the heat?
How come RH is getting 100% of the heat when all of the other retail brokers did the same thing at the same time? Feels like a scape goat to take heat off the big boys. They were all in on it?

New to Stonks, but is it useful to know Root, Inc (ROOT) seems to be in a pattern of jacking up insurance rates and driving out customers as their stream of investment money slows?
In case you didn't know Root, Inc (ROOT) has been consistently   up their rates at a seemingly exponential rate over the last three years as they burn through investor rounds.  They launched by offering absurdly low rates anywhere they could and pour money gasoline onto a marketing fire. At this point their customer acquisition seems to have jumped the shark.  You can see it immediately by dipping into the    As a pandemic drags on and people drive less I think Root is too small a player to eat the costs of people dropping or lowering policies.

NEWBIES; here's why you should hold onto shares you bought, squeeze or no squeeze.
Sorry if this was supposed to be posted somewhere else or with a different flair.  TL;DR - Investing costs money, and you probably would have smooth üß† or    your first trade anyways. Use this opportunity and motivation to learn more about trading, and about companies YOU believe in. Do you research, everyone here will tell you if you're retarded (or they're retarded \ cough\ DFV\ cough\ ) and one day you might be swimming in a pool of tendies.        ===> üë∂  + üìà =   /üí©üß†  üíπ  +   + üí≤ = üîªüí≤    +üìñ+üí≤ = üíπüçóüçóüçó  Like many of you newbies I bought in to the hype around GME around the peak. I believe that if Robinhood hadn't restricted trading the squeeze would have already happened, but that's besides the point right now. Investing is a complicated game, and that's really what it is on this side of the money. A game. You have no control of over what happens to your money after you put it in the slot, the company will do as it will and you just hope you get some green instead of red.  Here's the squeeze, investing has a cost of entry. No matter when you got in the game you would have had to pay a price, and your subject to the same swings as everybody else on the market and every other smooth brained retard or autist. Every investor has lost money at some point, be it on paper or realized. Not every investment works out, and if you're new it can be discouraging to have your first attempt blow up in your face. But you paid the cost of entry, you opened an account and started trading, and the next trade might go differently.  Learn about options, learn about margin, learn how to read all of those fancy graphs that your broker offers you. Read up on what a company is doing and how its performing year over year and against its competitors. Come over here and pitch us on it with a well thought out DD. Include    üçó  for the retards.  Use this opportunity to transform into an AUTIST, like some beautiful retarded butterfly that made a chrysalis out of loss porn and    memes. Grow your knowledge as an investor, and TAKE ANOTHER CHANCE. Invest in what YOU believe is going to succeed, or if you're still too retarded for that read a DD someone else made. If you're confident, YOLO IT! Odds are someone else will do it too, then you can either eat tendies or stand in line at the food bank TOGETHER. And THATS what WSB is about, being RETARDED TOGETHER. And making (or losing) a SHIT TON of money.     And remember; even a retarded gorilla picks the right stock twice a day.        EDIT: OR buy BECUASE YOU LIKE THE STOCK. That works too.

Silver Lake cashes out on AMC for $713 million after Reddit-fueled rally
But the shares ended trading at $  on Wednesday, as traders targeted heavily shorted stocks such as AMC and GameStop Corp. Silver Lake sold its stake over several open-market transactions that day, according to regulatory filings.             HOW DID THEY KNOW TO CASH OUT OR SELL EVERYTHING ON WEDNESDAY???
WSB

About the Depository Trust Company
Last time I opened a thread about then I got muted and banned for 3 days here on WSB. So I'm gonna try to bring up this discussion again. Who are they and why did they make Robinhood, Revolut and others to stop buying AMC and GME? I don't know much about economy stuff, but I know they increased the margin a lot (or something like this?). Don't get me wrong, I don't defend Robinhood and the others, I'm just asking questions. I was doing some reading on Wikipedia and was amazed to see how much money are in the game when it comes to them. Hell, I never thought that so much money can be in the game. But why now? Why did they stopped the trading when it was about normal people, the working class who are trying to make a difference and point out about what is wrong with the market and basically with this world? Also, I'm missing some stuff. I had more to point out a few days ago, but my memory is not that good anymore... Fortunately.
Anyone know a reliable investment app

I'm done. I can't. I've deleted the original post. Peace be with all of you. I'm sorry for inconveniencing you all.
Question- is there a way to see what are the most talked about tickers in a day on here? I know obviously GME is at the top. But I would like to see the other ones in the top 10 or 15...

They ran out of money and it‚Äôs embarrassing that it ever happened like that. DO NOT USE ROBINHOOD FOR REGULAR TRADING. you can only buy limit shares of AMC/GME and it‚Äôs not worth it.

I am the resistance!
Posted this on Facebook, but I feel like it‚Äôll get like this here eventually. For the record I‚Äôm   $amc
Alright guys Im only going to say this once, so pay attention.   1. If you‚Äôre going to invest in stocks the first thing you need to do is join a Facebook group.  The people there have already done the homework and know exactly what they‚Äôre talking about.   2. Second, look for post that just have the ticker symbol ex: $abc That way you know exactly what to buy without doing any hard reading.  Picking a winner is easy. Just look for the following emojis.  üåïüìà  üöÇ  3. Always, always buy high and sell low.  Dont bother reading books or looking up quality youtube videos. You didn‚Äôt need those economics or finance classes in school, you‚Äôre buying a lambo anyway.  4. Then complain about your losses to the same Facebook group because you didn‚Äôt know what a stop limit was or when was the right time to pull out.   5. Become cynical and bitter about any stock, that anyone mentions, but continue to not understand market mechanics.  6. Assume everything is a pump and dump trap. Even though there is evidence to the contrary. #AMC #GME #shortladderattack  If you do these things, you too can be a Facebook group stock investor.  For the record I am not a financial advisor, and this actually terrible advice. But it is the majority of the group and you‚Äôre all at one phase of this or another.
If DFV goes to jail do we have a civil duty to rally GameStop stock
Look i know you guys love tendies and i took mine on the GME shit show on the way down but i‚Äôm still holding 20 shares on some cult mind type mentality.   But realistically if DFV gets pegged with jail time (haha) Do we have a moral obligation to rally GameStop stock in protest?  i‚Äôve seen enough fucking rocket ships and diamonds  the only paper hands i see are ones full of money.   Edit: I fucking know he‚Äôs innocent but they never side on the people‚Äôs side. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll look for anything to blame this on him.

WSB isn't about collectively buying and selling.
Look, GME got many excited. I got them   . But this is not a place for people to post, "Lets all buy XXX Stock now!". If this is what you think WSB is about, you haven't been here long enough.
Has anyone else noticed that the 5 day trade diagrams for GME and AMC are almost identical?
AMC:    GME:       Both have a period where there's a huge jump in the price, then fall to relatively similar levels by stock average over trading the few following days after. Even the volume seems similar if I'm reading this correctly?  Is this an indication that Hedge funds are ladder selling to manipulate the prices downward so they don't get fucked by short selling more than they are already?     Also BUY MORE GME, KEEP THOSE HANDS DIAMOND YOU MAD LADS                         TAKE THAT STOCK TO THE MOON, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE                  WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Do you hear me, Elon?
If Elon.. buys GME..  we all should buy at least 1 Tesla. I think GME can provide offline infra for charging station, high speed internet along with starlin for Tesla owners. Not only that, but also while being charged, Tesla owners shop and play games, watch movies, and all inside their Tesla. New CTO also can enhance this business more efficiently and efficiently. I truly feel the potential growth of GME in the future and have learnt the power of our community since joining. I like GameStop.

Ok. I'd like to move my cashapp shares to webull. Can't figure out how. I am learning more daily and all I know is hold and buy AMC. Please. Retards. Help me. Comment and roast as well.

Hello fellow primates, if you were Cohen, what position would you offer DFV?
-60% I feel like a true fucking retard.
I would post the screenshot but its not letting my upload to imgur. Nevertheless, down 60% on GME and I feel like a fucking loser. Invested most of my savings of like $4k and now it feels like I got hit by a car shit fucking sucks. Whatever man this shit just wasnt meant to be for me props to everyone who profited and congrats, idk if I should just sell what I have left and take my loss like a retard that I am or hold and hope to god
Looks like amc holders are in for a ride!
Let's Make Sellas Life Sciences ($SLS) the Next GME
As I see it, $SLS is hugely undervalued currently due to a massive amount of shorting (  on Reddit.  Also, there is definitely something going on here beneath the surface, because today (Feb 3)   the stock was up $    with no news being released. For some reason, news outlets have been saying that the uptick is due to Reddit, but I didn't find many threads that got a lot of attention. Potentially there is some big news underwraps, so I'd be interested to hear what you guys think about it. I definitely would love to know if there's any info I'm missing out on here, as it seems like a clear cut winner to me.  I know that SLS isn't a funny meme stock like GME, but I honestly think it's a worthy cause for us to support as a community. Especially because a bunch of investors/hedgefunds are shorting a cancer-fighting company to make some money, which is a pretty scummy thing to do imo.  EDIT: Removed a sentence based on feedback
Noobie with Some Questions
1. Why is trading information, like active shorts and active options only available to the big firms like Citadel?   2. How do they claim a stock is publicly traded with full transparency if only big firms know trading information not available to the public? It seems like wallstreet treats it like a privately owned company at that point. If a firm is paying for information only available to them, then that's not a publicly traded stock.  3. Why is an IPO only available to the big firms until they get done profitting off it until it dives down to lows? Shouldn't it be called an Initial Private Offering?  I feel that the general public is being gamed hard and there should be more public/transparent information that the SEC should require to be known. When the most vital information to a trade is withheld from the general public, that stock should no longer be considered publicly traded. The stock market is a private club for the rich. Why are they pretended it's publicly traded?

With the world monitoring and scrapping our sub, we need to post in code or more mindfully
So it should be obvious by now that this sub has bots galore. It also has a lot of actual smart people. And 1000x Austitic dumb fucks. It also has scrapers that are minoring our sentiment and probably trading off what this sub is discussing or trades that the sub is playing. We need to outsmart Wall Street again and get ahead of them.
Hey r/WSB...
The Next Step: Buy Stuff From GameStop
Just checking in, but wouldn't the next logical step, after holding a hefty GME portfolio, be to support GME with your business?   instead of throwing another $5k at the stock, buy something you would want from them, make their Q1 go through the roof? Ideally it would be something where they make the most margin rather than an item where 90% of the cost goes to Microsoft or Sony.
WE ARE STONKS!
So is amc dead?
Not hearing abt it much anymore. Is it time to close?

How to Fidelity Instant Deposit for faster YOLO?!
I know this is probably not the place but since so many joined Fidelity recently can one of you help a smooth brain out?

Is instant deposit basically a margin lite?  I was trying to buy GME in cash only and had to wait 2 days. Yes I ended up buying more @300 and yes I‚Äôm still holding!

I'm sad. Why does everyone here seem to hate silver now?
You guys scared the crap out of TPTB for a day or two and then gave up on it. WTF? An army of shills was sent here to deter any attempts on silver, and make it look like a GME distraction ploy. They also paid off some journos to write stuff like "don't even try it, you cannot short squeeze silver" and everyone now seems to have given up.   Silver would be way more fun to squeeze than GME, just notice how every single mainstream media outlet went up in arms firing 20 articles per hour as soon as you started talking about silver. Why do you think is that?   1 ounce is $25 now, it's nothing. If we go for a squeeze it could easily go parabolic. This would be a systemic shock, it would disrupt everything. The spillover would be huge.  Edit: 2 fucking per cent!! LMAO   Downvote bots are being used here to target silver posts, wake up don't be a useful idiot!

How are we the ones getting monitored by the SEC
I just find it absolutely unbelievable how WSB is getting combed through by the SEC for "Market Manipulation" when there is blatantly clear short laddering happening all day long. Anyone with level II market data can see this. The fact that the SEC is turning a blind eye is disgusting.  My shares will be buried with me and    will be etched on my tombstone.  To the SEC intern reading this, I know you saw the hundreds of posts on this sub highlighting the short laddering. Yet you probably have done nothing about it.  GME to the moon or the dirt. I will hold till the end.  Obligatory            üåï
Wrote this tweet as a joke, now I hope the SEC sees this üñï

Let‚Äôs Go!!!
Hear me out: Should we really be killing Robinhood?
I know we‚Äôre all extremely pissed off in Robinhood‚Äôs buy limits/buy blocking, which pretty damn directly killed GME momentum. But, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this, and I feel kinda guilty for jumping on the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs kill Robinhood‚Äù train. They‚Äôre not my primary brokerage, but, the more I hear and read, the more I‚Äôm convinced that Robinhood basically had no choice but to set the limits they set.  There‚Äôs no excuse for their lack of transparency when this happened, and I‚Äôll stand by that. But really though, would retail trading and WSB have the power they have if it weren‚Äôt for Robinhood? Wall Street is now fully, painfully aware of the power we (retail traders) have. We move markets, even when they try hard to keep us from moving them. And I think it‚Äôs pretty undeniable that Robinhood helped create this, and without Robinhood we may not be able to sustain it.  We‚Äôve now made them the target of the regulators. Not the hedge funds, Robinhood.  Legislation and regulation that affects Robinhood will affect every other retail brokerage, every novice investor, everybody who can‚Äôt afford to put $25k+ into a brokerage account, everyone who can‚Äôt afford commissions.  It‚Äôs pretty clear to me that Robinhood was more of the victim of corruption and manipulation than the perpetrator of it. Again, there‚Äôs no excuse for the lack of transparency, and I hope they‚Äôve learned their lesson, and we should hold them accountable. But, this sub has an immense amount of power, and I don‚Äôt think we should be aiming it at Robinhood... effectively our former friend. When a friend stabs you in the back, it hurts, and I think we all feel that way. But I don‚Äôt think the blame lies with them, and I think Robinhood helps us a lot more than it hurts us. Food for thought, fine to disagree with me, and I‚Äôm open to being wrong and changing my mind. I‚Äôm just worried about where this goes and I think we need to step back and look at the big picture. If Robinhood dies, it‚Äôs the hedge funds and institutions who will be laughing, a lot harder than anyone here will.    Edit  : Am retarded. Thanks for the reality check. Just needed some perspective on all of that.

No , but really ... AMC to Mars or are WEtards moving on after the GME hype ?
ü§î
I'm starting to think two things
A) Someone realized they had enough pull to get a whole subreddit to buy a stock. Right after they bought a ton of it cheap. And since no one actually looks into the data, they‚Äôd just do it without knowing if the story was true.  And they‚Äôve been selling all of their shares to newbies coming in to buy at the all time high.   B) The short thing was true, but shorters used what /r/wallstreetbets is doing to make even more. They could sell their borrowed shares after the price was driven up. Then buy them back now that the price is tanking. They get to make money on one last pump and dump before they have to give the shares back. And if it drops low enough, they can make money off the original short too.   I look forward to hearing about the losses. For me it will be $1,100 max. How much do you stand to lose?
Not much, but im holding
The people Vs the hedge funds and the stock exchange?
How with all this supposed evidence of all the market manipulation is there not a small army of lawyers and experts volunteering to take real action against these people / institutions ?  I'm not American but from everything I read about American politics dose anyone actually believe that your politicians are going to make a change in the system?   Surly a mass movement of the people with no political alliance / ties will make more of a mark against the system than some opertunist politician's who will just hijack the voice of the people and purposely just use it for personal gain and extra publicity then fail the people as they always do!   The 2008 financial crisis hurt people the world over I was living in London at that time and people were hurt you saw it everywhere the world over( my family are South African ).  The people have a voice, it's being heard the world over, now you guys need the worriors now.  Bloomberg reports that the SEC are going after Reddit users for market manipulation.( Not the hedge funds or the media)  I haven't seen one post where people are offering to help those that might be in trouble but innocent ?  It's literally the people Vs them coming and they gonna use every penny every dirty trick and they gonna make sure they send a message!  Should there be a go fund me to pay for the best lawyers in the world ?  Will there be an army of volunteer lawyers ?  Will there ever be a real power for the people ?   This looks like the best place to start, there's no politics here's only people who seem to exposing a broken system that seems to have control over both polical party's.  When change starts in the USA it filters out the rest of the world very quickly, you guys are the masters of media and the message it carries and that is a cold hard fact.   Are the people gonna stand up ?    Edit : I think I'm wrong I think there should be a 3rd  political party involved I think this should be pushed to @jimmy_dore and his push for the people's party.  Taking this to the next level with his viewership and voice and possible connections with glen greenwald and co.  If the "people's party" could adleast make a dent in the current situation there would be such an influx of unified people it would become the true opposition the current system!  Get @jimmy_dore onboard !!!!!

Cause that's all you dumb asses ever talk about.  The shorts have the high ground.  The squeeze probably already happened.  You got screwed by robinhood.  Get over it.  Go back to hunting your food.  Go back to being smart.
Robinhood made me not trust the system and I HATE it.
What happened the other day (the restrictions on buying AND the allowing to sell positions) was some of the grossest manipulation i've ever seen. I don't know how to recover my faith and trust the markets again after that shit happened. I know i'm preaching to the choir, but what can I do to keep me determined and continue to invest with confidence? The system is rigged. I've heard it my whole life, but i've never had it so blatantly in my face. Hundreds of thousands of investors lost money and no new rules have come out, nobody's going to jail, and i'm disgusted. Fuck the system being in favor of those who have money and FUCK ROBINHOOD.
Getting my full deposit back from Robinhood
I bought some stocks with my first deposit and the stocks went down, but my second deposit arrived this morning.   The stocks are now negative I am afraid they will take the second deposit away even though I did not use that money to buy anything.  I just want the full refund of the second deposit that arrived today cause I don‚Äôt wanna deal w Robinhood anymore.     my margin investing is off. So I am really hoping I didn‚Äôt borrow anything from them.  I am in communication w them via email. I am going to keep my stocks until they go up.

The Name  itself should tell us all we need to know.  Now observe the closing price after hours.     There has always been suspicion of manipulation of the markets for some time, but this is no coincidence  .  I'm holding my AMC and GME.    A lot won't survive but I will be here when the smoke settles and we will rebuild stronger.   But, hey what do I know I'm just a tard .
Posting this as a gain because getting out from Robinhood is better than any green in my personal screens. You KNOW I'm holding.
Is GME ever going to the moon?
Do y'all still think GME is going back to where it was? I'm one of you   üß§ and I'm still holding and I've lost 400k. I believe that GME is gonna go up sooner or later. But do we still think it's gonna go to the moon?
Did AMC and GME shirts got partly covered at a loss?
Do you think the shorts for AMC and GME where partly covered at the low grade price at a loss, and they are just going to take the hit in interest payments and wait us out?  It seems that it would be possible that they did not double down, and took a hit to their short positions to the point they can wait for our movement to lose steam and come out of the short positions then.  I have been hearing that they put more puts down this week on both, but I haven't seen any data to back it up.  Positions AMC   GME 6@115

The   cannabis boom and why you retards are getting played.
What's up assholes.    I may take some heat for this, but if you don't like it, fuck you. üñï  I'm seeing a lot of bullshit and fake news being posted here daily about the recent APHA/Tilray pump that has been happening all over reddit. If you look at any of the big investing or stock forums you will see posts about how APHA/TLRY are the best way to play   Cannabis legalization.    Insert rocket emojis right?    NOPE      The reason you dipshits are getting played is because Apha and Tilray don't have a single license to grow or sell cannabis in the United States.    If you want to play the   Cannabis boom, you should be looking at investing in American companies, CGC or the sleep-easy pick MSOS ETF which holds all the top   pot stocks.    Again, Apha/Tilray are a Canadian producer that owns a small   craft beer company without a single license to grow or sell cannabis in the United States.    Claiming they will be "the world‚Äôs biggest cannabis company." will be short lived at best as they most likely won't even be in the top 5 when   decriminalization occurs. Curaleaf , Green Thumb, Cresco, Trulieve are all   multi state operators and they are all top players that will continue dominating the   üî•üî•üî•  I'm also seeing A LOT of comparison between APHA and CGC with people claiming that Aphria will move up to match Canopy's market cap. CGC is a beast and they are backed by Costellation motherfucking Brands (STZ), a fortune 500 company who invested $5 billion in them. They have used that money to open their own wholly owned retail stores, a beverage plant, they have Biosteel sports nutrition which is the official drink of the Raptors, Sixers and Mavericks, Martha Stewart CBD, they have several celebrity and athlete endorsements (Patrick Mahomes, Gleyber Torres, Ezekiel Elliott, Conor Mcdavid), This Works cosmetics, Storz & Bickel, and they sell CBD pet products as well. And of course, a clear path of entry into the   via the acquisition of Acreage a   multi state operator in 15 States with 29 open dispensaries and 7 production facilities. they also have a stake in Terrascend another   MSO.    Aphria has none of what I mention above. Don't be a fucking donkey.    There is no way for them to surpass any of the top players in the space. Once the APHA/TLRY merger is completed, their combined company cash to debt position will be hot garbage and will need to be addressed. On top of that, the only way for them to enter and compete and get licenses in the states is to acquire a   multi state operator and the only way that will ever happen is? you guessed it fucktards, doing a raise $$ and diluting shareholders. (wouldn't be surprised to see it happen soon with the recent run up)  With the dems now having control of the house, the senate and the presidency and Chuck Schumer making his intentions clear that cannabis reform is a top priority this year this rocket ship is about to blow everyone tits off.     The hype is back in marijuana land.   You would be better off going with literally any of the   multi state operators over them or MSOS. If after all this you still think APHA/Tilray is a better play for   legalization, you're most likely adopted.  With that being said, here's a few more rocket emoji just in case.     I'm no expert, do your due diligence and fact check what you read before making any financial decisions and don't be fooled by thinking a Canadian license producer with no money will dominate the    Cya nerds
Robinhood's user agreement says they can do the things that they did last week. But I'm not a Robinhood user, so I never agreed to their terms. So didn't they cause me material harm?
How do you do, fellow   ?  Basically, RH can fuck right off cuz I was holding shares in like 4 of our main tickers (and still am holding...  and  buying the dip this week) when they started restricting trading. And I watched my     turn into that beautiful shade of red we all love.  So while I can  see  a legal argument about RH users having agreed to trade halts at any time, it affected everyone who owned the stock by scaring away the delicate little    and blocking the bulls from buying the HF shorts.  Now I'm DEFINITELY not a lawyer, but I'm wondering if any of you smooth brains happen to be one, and if you could chime in with any thoughts?  Obviously, this is not advice of any kind, including, but not limited to: legal, investing, diet or exercise.
A look inside the office of Melvin Capital
My name is Juancho. I'm currently a paid intern at Melvin Capital and have been doing this for a few months. I got this job after I was arrested for forging fake checks. Gabriel Foreskin saw what had happened and admired my ambition for money and the lengths I would go to create fake money for the benefit of myself. He said I was just what he needed and taught me everything I needed to know about synthetic shares and shorting stocks. He told me there was no limit for short selling and to just keep injecting non-existent shares into the market. He said to me slowly, like I was retarded,  "it literally can't go tits up." So I did as I was told. Rick from office block C said thats what he was doing too. He explained that if we just jack it up to the tits with shorts that there is no way Gamestop can come back.   That was only 2 months ago.  During the end of 2020 we saw a small rise in GME stock which hurt our short position but we blew it off due to the new console cycle. We assumed after the consoles were sold, their company would finally bite the dust. We were wrong. After the stock hit $200 I saw Mike from block F call his wife and kids to tell them the horrific news. They were going to have to sell off their 4th jetski so now there will only be enough jetskis for 3 of them. Rumor has it his wife threatened to leave and his kids won't call him "dad" now. Danny, the janitor, was so upset about bankruptcy rumors that he shit in the elevator and quit on the spot. Pretty sure Danny pissed in Jimmy's cup too but that fuckwad deserved it. It was one of the worst days I've seen here at Melvin Capital. We hoped we'd seen the last until I got a tweet notification that sent chills down my spine. I went into the office of Gabriel Foreskin to tell him the news.  "Sir?"  "Yeah come on in, what is it?"  "Elon tweeted," I said. "He said 'Gamestonk' with a link to the retards burning down our firm"  Gabriel paused and then looked up at me and said... "Oh gourd"     (This is satire. I am not a financial advisor. Wassup SEC I know you're here.)

How do we feel about pot stocks?
Fellow retard here,  I‚Äôve been    on a few lots of pot stocks HEMP, MJNA, NDEV, and CNABQ to name a few and they‚Äôve been bearish for the better part of the last two years, but I won‚Äôt sell. They‚Äôre trading at extraordinarily low values (>$.07 per share), which is why I am able to purchase larger share amounts, hoping that upon federal decriminalization these securities values will spike. While the stonks have been bearish for most of the last two years, these securities seem to be experiencing a significant upward motion since Monday. Am I just full retard or is there any hope of these stonks generating some actual value?

What happens to a stock price if there are more buyers at lower prices than sellers at higher prices?
Hypothetically, following your question, if we have 10 sellers who placed a combined sell order to sell 1K shares at $11 and we have 20 Buyers who placed a combined order to buy 2K shares at $10 and there are no other traders, then there will be no trade - price remain unchanged - bid did not meet ask.  If you ant to manipulate price and have enough $$$ for that and you want to buy at lower possible price, then theoretically speaking, you may do following - this example is simplified to lower volume for better understanding , in reality volumes are much higher:  let say a stock is traded at $10 per share and there are only 10 sellers .You place another order to sell 20 share at $9 and that order is executed and price of your stock drops-crashes to $9 which is 10% loss in one day. You lose $10 (1$ on each share) As your stock lost 10% it created panic and now other traders are ready to sell this stock at $  because they are afraid of deeper crash and now, there are 1000 shares are available at $  You lost $10 to push price down, yet, now you can buy 1000 shares $  cheaper. As you bought 1000 shares you created a volume surge. Before we had average volume = 10 shares per day and on the day of your purchase we had volume = 1000 shares per day you continue to put small buy orders at a little bit higher than he market price and you create some up-move. The other trades see that price bounced up and they start buying this stocks and they will move price up without you. you caught 1000 losers and you just sit and watch as other loser move your stock up This is very simplified example and it is very difficult to implement, unless, you have a lot of money and you can cover either supply or demand of those traders who you want to play against. It is still possible that some institutional traders may manipulate low volume stocks and that is why Richard Wyckoff (in his "Stock Market Techniques" book) does not recommend trading low volume stocks - they could be manipulated easily.  It is difficult to manipulate high volume stocks, still, when you see a strong volume surge after a strong decline, as in point #5 above, it means that some big institutional investors are buying and if they continue to buy in big volumes, they will reverse this stock from a decline.   That's what Hedges are doing right now.  Source:

How to outsmart hedge funds automatically tracking our mentions of stock

GME options that expired last Friday, can anyone educate me?
All those options that expired was supposed to release millions if shares to buy, correct? There was like huge ones at 115, 200s, and 320.

$PSEC: Autistic Earnings Play
FIRST AND FOREMOST: YES I LIKE GME$, DOUBLED MY POSITION YESTERDAY ON DIP  CALLS ARE SO CHEAP  So lets get into it:  \-WHAT IS PSEC?  "Prospect Capital Corporation is a leading publicly-traded Business Development Company (‚ÄúBDC‚Äù). We make debt and equity investments in   middle market businesses across a range of industries, and seek to deliver steady, attractive returns to our shareholders"  So basically they give business loans  \-EARNINGS 2/9  It has    by the monkies. @ .16, -11% year over year. So if it out performs earnings it could have a major spike. Following its better than expected earnings in 5/11/2020, the stock price ran up nearly 100% over the next 30 days.     Why would a business loan company have better earnings in COVID times?  According to   Q4 2020 report:  # Business Openings Recover, Reopenings Rise, and Changes in Consumer Interest Indicate a Return to Pre-Pandemic Activities, According to Yelp Economic Average  More business loans more cash for the business as a whole.  Positions 2/19 7$ Calls  This is not financial advice.  EDIT: Im literally retarded and had the wrong earnings date

Another Roaring 20s?
A pandemic happened in the 20s since the 1820s. Are we now going have a roaring 20s every 100 years? With online retail trading increases over the past few years and the recent events, could this start a new era for retail investors and spark this centuries roaring 20s?  If this works, not only will we bankrupt hedge funds, but we can also show that retail investors really can make a ton of money from the market by trading, not just long term investing. Gallup said in 2019 that 54% of Americans owned stock ((  But do the just own and hold until they retire or regularly trade? If 50% of Americans traded regularly how would that change the market? I‚Äôm not a financial advisor or anything, but I think that it could be possible that retail investors could gain some power soon.

I‚Äôm sorry but it doesn‚Äôt look like GME is going to work out the way many of us were hoping. I really wish either the      guys made their millions or the hedge funds got hurt from this but they didn‚Äôt.  Its seeming like the outcome is going to be Robinhood ownership in a legal battle and possibly option trading restricted from retail trailers. Either way, keep your heads up boys, the opportunities are out there everyday.  Use this as an opportunity to learn and grow as an investor.  It will pay off.  Anyway looking forward to WSB getting back to its roots.  Hopefully see you all on the moon someday!

This needs to get confirmed true or not.
First thing I read that have me worried about our situation, can someone confirm if this is true? Quoting from comment on yt:  " The reason the squeeze didn't (and will never) happen... all trading platforms default to ENABLING stock lending. This means that the hedgefunds can keep rolling their shorts by borrowing YOUR shares to pay back the ones they owe, and perpetually postpone buying back their shares until the squeeze threat disappears.  Legally, all platforms must let you OPT OUT of lending out your shares. However, like I said, it defaults to ENABLED and they bury this setting in complicated menus.  It took 20 minutes for me to find the convoluted path to the obscure place that Webull put this setting.  Later, when trying to tell others how I opted out, it took me 20 minutes again to find out how I got there the first time.  Every person on Wallstreet Bets is buying shares to lend out to the hedgefunds.  If you have not opted out of stock lending, then your stock purchases are HELPING the shorters, because you are paying for the stocks out of YOUR pocket so that they can borrow them for free without having to buy them out of THEIR pockets.  How many people on WSB and YouTube are smart enough to opt out? How many people on WSB and YouTube are unintentionally helping the enemy?  This is why the hedgefunds are laughing at you, saying, "Please! Buy more stocks and hold them with your diamond hands!  You are giving us an unlimited supply of free borrowed stock to juggle our shorts until the day our shorts are profitable, again!"  Also, by borrowing YOUR stocks in a short, they are ripping your stocks right out of your so called "diamond" hands and dumping/selling them on the market, driving the price down.  So when you buy 100 shares, in the background those 100 shares are instantly sold on market (even though they still show up in your account). That is how short lending works.  I will not join this movement because the ONLY way the short squeeze can happen is if 100% of the people on the WSB and youtube OPT OUT of "Stock Lending".  Not going to happen. People only learned how to use the BUY button. They don't look for the hidden OPT OUT button.  The price rise you see is nothing more than your own created pump and dump, resulting in both losers and winners ONLY ON REDDIT/YOUTUBE SIDE (not on the hedgefunds side). "

I wonder how many people lost too much over GME
I bought 2 stocks at   peace with losing it.  Thankfully It didn't dent my account too much as I'm only partially retarded and still had 99% of my money diversified elsewhere  I'm curious as to how many people are now in massive debt due to   wanna see the bloodbath  And I'm curious as to how many people are broke due to meme charts.
Hope you newbies like some real loss porn. Just makes me hold even harder
Crash is King
Yeah, I bought on speculation and not a full DD. I bought being influenced by the fact that hedge funds were "getting their due" and that individuals were getting that done. Now I've lost a massive percentage of the funds I had available, and I might as well hold. I was part of this first "recognized" movement of individuals that brought some really shady stuff to the surface... and that counts.  Do I think anything was "won"? No. In fact, I think additional regulation and legislation is what we won... but we also won the fact that now "they" know they can't do it all unrecognized by the masses. Will they keep doing it? Yep... for now. Look at the blatant ladder attacks the whole way down... they don't care who sees because all they have to pay is fines, and those are less than what they stood to lose. Tomorrow though... with that additional regulation, maybe not as easy.  However it comes out, now I hold... cold dead fingers and all that, and I'm happy I was a very small (and late) part of it.

Very soon will the rocket take off.
1. They are still manipulating the price, lowering it each time with ladder attacks.   2. The media has been pushing that they‚Äôve covered their losses and pulled out more than ever.   I‚Äôm thinking they are lowering the price enough with these ladder attacks to the point where the can buy a large volume and this will be the ignition for the rocket.

About to take out a HELOC for cheap GME
I will hold til the end. I just hope you guys are right...
NOTE: I am not trying to be a üè≥‚Äç  , these fists are made of the finest crystallized carbon and if I end up sinking with the ship then so be it. I just wanted to vent and hope you guys can give a fellow autist some words of affirmation.    idk man, I bought shares at 300 just to do my part in holding the line thinking it couldn't get THAT low. Now I'm just getting sad cause I keep seeing posts saying "IT ISN'T OVER! TOMORROW IS THE DAY!" Then tomorrow comes and I sit there like the ape I am at 9:29 expecting GME to break the stratosphere the moment market opens, only to end the day negative once more. Every time I listen to WSB I lose money then promise to myself to do the opposite of whatever WSB says moving forward. Then I read posts that seem like they know what they're talking about and I think "Well okay I mean THIS guy isn't that retarded, it actually has a chance of not going tits up." And then it does, and the cycle continues.  I made some decent money from an option before things really started to kick off. Then my ape brain dove back in, because from what people have been saying, it will undoubtedly go back up because "Short-ladder attack this" and "fake SI values that" or "the SEC is lifting it's fucky fuck restriction tomorrow". Then someone gets a top post with hundreds of shiny awards saying "Ladder attacks aren't actually a thing you guys just made it up" then an hour later another post saying "No dumbass they are actually a thing they're mentioned these articles from 2007-2013".     I love this sub, it has some of the dankest of memes and it never fails to make me laugh. I just hope you guys are right...

Thoughts on Hemp stocks.
I wanted to get into trading and was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on Hemp stock. I know most are OTC:Pink so I was wondering if it would be worth playing around with. Been looking at HEMP and CANN if I do decide to play around in the Hemp stocks.
A few questions on GME
\-How would the hedge funds have been able to borrow more shares to short during the middle of a supposed "Short Squeeze"?  Especially when the amount of shorted shares was already 140% of float.  Did anyone of you try and short GME when it was over $300 a share?  Were you able to do it?  \-Why would anyone allow their shares of GME to be borrowed at 18% interest? Especially during a moment in history where the stock has just risen 1700% in a very short amount of time?  Wouldn't those share holders want to capitalize on that momentum and just sell their shares for a huge profit?  \-For the share holders that did have their shares lent out right before the big jump.  Why didn't they all recall their shares at the same time? Then they could make a quick 1700% gain, instead of the 18% annual interest?  \-Lastly, why did the board of GME not issue $100,000,000 worth of new shares when the price hit the $300 range?  Is it still possible there is something up their sleeve, where they believe the price will still go higher than that?
Can GME still go up?

DISCLAIMER:   I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I just like this stock.   I keep getting notifications from Revolut  >GME is down 40 something percent since last close # >GME is down 50 something percent since last close # >GME is down 60 something percent since last close  Alright alright, I get it. GME is down. I don't care, I'm still holding - this is purely a scare tactic to get us to sell. It's not happening. I'm holding GME, I'm holding AMC, and I'M NOT SELLING NO MATTER WHAT

I Don't See No Stinkin' Shares Being Offered
Yeah, that's right, the only catalyst needed to define which direction we're going to go.  Until Papa Cohen delivers the news that a share offering has taken place, we will fuel up for our tendie trip.  Cohen and Burry got into this trade because they understood the price was going to go up.  Burry took some profit along the way, but is still in this trade.  Cohen took another step further and got his peeps on the board.  The next logical step is wipe the debt and build the war chest.  The next step happens with an offering.  While I believe there will be two offerings, first to wipe debt and reset the fundamental story.  The second will be when the actual squeeze to Mars happens.  No one on the news is talking about this at all.  There was one reference last week about GME management not taking advantage of an offering, but we know they will.  It is only time and the diamond hands will be rewarded.         BTFD!!!!!  To the Moon!!!!        EDIT: Not financial advice, caveat emptor, e pluribus unum or some shit
Should I transfer my stonks out of robinhood now?

If you want a date to panic, panic on Feb 9, don't do it today.
1st off: I'm new to all this  2nd off: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE  3rd off: 4 GME @ 225, I'm not a big player, I'm probably a lot like most of the people who just jumped in here.  It seems like there's some people panicking today, and it really is not the day to panic. Sure if you're massively underwater in your day-to-day life, and need that cash to survive then fuck yeah pull out. But if you have your life in order, and you bought high, there's no reason to pull out right now. We're going to get a great chunk of information February 9th to see how short the hedgies are, that's a way smarter day to make a big decision.   If you're pulling out now, you're just pulling out from pure fear. Wait for a little data, then make a decision.     till then fuckers.
Weird amount of removed comments?
Has anyone noticed the insane amounts of removed comments lately with the $GME dip? Wassapwitdat
To those of you holding still, get out. My last post comments show the true nature of r/WSB & $GME
Stop asking questions stop diamond handing stop holding the line you got dumped. It‚Äôs common in this subreddit. It‚Äôs a pump and dump. You probably downloaded Robinhood put your savings in there and now it‚Äôs gone. Your fellow r/WSB users are getting lunch with it. I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre struggling from it. Just get out now.

GameStop : Name Recognition and Value
No matter what happens in the short term the GameStop name and brand is now exponentially more valuable.    No one cares where they download their games and WSB has created a huge opportunity for the company that I think GameStop will capitalize on.  Before WSB I was just surprised the local store was still open.   I think this event has changed the playing field for online game companies and given GameStop a great position for the future.   That is why I will be buying GME.
Ok, status report. When did you buy/sell GME? Or are you still holding?

Soo.. Did we lose?
Is the war still going on? Did we lose?

Is it possible to create a worthwhile crowdfund/charity of some sort that buys and holds GME?
Just doing some brainstorming.  I see three benefits,   one   is that if it gains a lot of money it could be a beacon of stability to hold, the   second   one is that it would allow anyone to contribute to this meaning people who might not could or would otherwise, and the   third   one is that this would need to be shareable on social media so if a video is made it could help educate people and drive up interest.  There's a bunch of questions and challenges though, like: - Is this legally possible?  - Would anyone even be interested in donating? - Is it too late to get this going? - Needing to ensure that this is done in good faith. - Having competent people taking on the task of doing this.  Are there better alternative routes?

Resources to learn how to trade?
Hey guys, I was wondering if any of you have suggestions on resources where I can learn more about the stock market and trading. I have been in this community for quite some time (before this recent member boom), and I have also dabbled in the stock market a little bit.   Currently I‚Äôm in college, so I don‚Äôt have a ton of money to invest. But I would really love to know of you guys have any tips, or know of any books, websites, or online courses that might help me learn how to do trading and long term investments in a more educated and safe manner.   Thanks guys, any suggestions are appreciated!!
Baby ape needing some hand holding on GME
Like many of the newby tards that joined this group due to the news, I‚Äôm finally getting a grasp of the insane potential that buying and holding this stock has.

Is there a breaking point or is it simply the higher the better?   Btw, I like this stock. Don‚Äôt hold, buy buy buy.

However, AMC is on the decline and I‚Äôm not sure whether it‚Äôs because the short squeeze is starting to wear off (if that‚Äôs a thing) or if it‚Äôs because people are getting nervous and selling and therefore I should hold on.

Inovio: INO (Hold and buy, Don't Short this      )
I have been invested into this stock since early February 2020. I bought at an average price 2/14/20 $ , then sold at $30 in mid-June. A good gain right? But, I kept finding myself coming back to this company from research and news articles. Here is why I came back to invest back into Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc for a long haul: Bought 2500 shares @ $  (would have bought more if funds)    Futures: 5 Top-line drugs on horizon  1. (VGX-3100), Phase 3, HPV 2. (INO-4800), Phase 2/3, Covid-19 3. (GLS-6150), Phase 1, Hep-C 4. (PENNVAX), Phase 1/2, HIV 5. (INO-5151), Phase 1/2 Prostate Cancer       Earnings and Future  1. 3rd Quarter, 2020 (  EPS), versus past qts. showing positive futures 2. 3 analyst rating of "Hold", 1 "Buy, 1 "Sell" 3. $  investment Grant from the Gates Foundation to further their registered trademark "CELLECTRA" for next generation approach to vaccine delivery   (more on this later)    4. $  investment Grant from   for rapid advances of (INO-4800) Covid-19 vaccine  5. Registered trademark "CELLECTRA" has been backed by Department of Defense $  investment.        Short Interest (roughly 1/3 of investors are betting against)  CELLECTRA: The revolutionary difference maker:        This device is being developed in a phase 2/3 clinical trial now.  Essentially this device using low voltage to open your skin pores, so that the vaccine made be placed in the lipid (fat) portion of your skin. This allows for more direct placement of drug and more efficiency for immunization.   If any of you were in the military prior to 2005, you would remember a device most commonly known as the "jet injection" gun. Essentially using pneumatic air to open the skin pores. The amounts of injections and immunization increased exponentially with the invention and use of this device. The reduction of plastics and needles was great too. Unfortunately, in Mid-2005 the Veterans Affairs put a stop to the devices, stating possible cross contamination exposure. Well, duh, in those days in the military they never would sanitize after each injection. I believe this CELLECTRA device from INO is going to be a revolutionary new method of immunization delivery.   The other big reason this company is unvalued in my opinion. Inovio has been doing their research and discovery without the help of Big BioTech firms. They are the only independent biotech company I have found with a Covid-19 vaccine without the oversight or partnership of the big tech.  Happy Hunting.  Buy and Hold for your future.

Why GME is going to continue its descent
Just kidding.  I'm here to ask a question, actually.  Is it JUST me, or is every post promoting positive sentiment getting censored? If you sort by new and keep the page loaded, any post promoting positive sentiment, or promoting diamond hands gets promptly removed (as I'm sure this will, too).  The news media is saying WSB lost all faith in GME, yet half of the new posts which aren't immediately deleted still speak to positive sentiment.  Is it just me, or am I just looking for hope with my 6 @ 245? With so many like me, you'd imagine there would at least be a non-insignificant amount of crusading, but it seems failed to be seen. Any opinions?

Paper Handed Friend Found A Problem...
So my friend is on Etrade. He decided today he was done, he needed money to pay bills. He's down 30k and needed to save the last 7k or so that he had left. Etrade WILL NOT LET HIM SELL the GME.

Best $400 lost in a long time.
This was by far a great learning experience. It was fun for a while. Then obviously. What is happening now. I jumped on the hype train. Bought a few stocks and paid attention to other plays. And lucky im not down much. 400 cdn. Monopoly money to most. yes. it sucked to lose it. But i look at it as. if i paid to take a coarse. it would cost more then 400. And no. Not saying im some pro now. But ive learned more in the last few weeks of lurking then any text book could teach. And the best way to learn is to get thrown into the fire and get burnt. The earlier in your career the better too.     So now. for many of you new to the stock market, And are seeing red. In more ways then one im sure. You'll learn and bounce back much smarter then you were on Monday. Good luck out there. Cant trust many in this game.

GME analysis questions
So, RH opened up the ability to trade much larger share counts.  Does anyone know why today is different than the previous few days? What makes today special?  Does anyone have an up to date short interest count, and looks like the big date is 2-19/2-20 for options expiration, yes?  If you can see short interest, can you break it out vs which ones expire when?  Thanks my fellow autists!
I hope you idiots are right about gme

I want to be honest to you!
I have lost a lot of money by my standards. These are savings of 3 months.           But you know what? Yess baby!    I wanted to be a degenerate ape. Now I am one.   I wanted fast money and fast life. I got a roller coaster ride.   Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.   I wanted to find people like me, these idiots I found.       I was thinking about selling yesterday, honestly.     But then I thought, what the hell do I want with a few hundred dollars left? The experience and what I learned is more than I could have ever bought with that $4k.     I didn't know what RH was until 2 weeks ago.  I never paid attention to volume when trading.   I didn't know I was fighting hedge funds on a daily basis.  I didn't know what options, futures and leverage were.     So, thanks for the lesson.      I know I am a degenerate. That's why I'm here.  I look forward to many future projects with you guys.     I love and hate you guys
Im not a true OG WSB-er, But I was here when times were simpler.
I see a ton of people on here talking about how "im still holding because im sick of being put down by the corrupt politicians, media and wallstreet. waaaaa." We gotta get something straight here.  WSB is not a movement. WSB is not a rebellion. WSB existed long before all this corruption was making headlines, and frankly, since I've been on here, no one gave a shit. WSB was originally a place where people went to fucking gamble in the stock market.  Idk where you newbies get off thinking you're noble by buying into GME at $350, and then buying more when it hits $90, as if you've really sucker punched the   economy. You guys say OHHHH, WE'VE TRIED TO COMBAT THE CORRUPTION, BUT NO ONE LISTENED, SO NOW IM GONNA HIT THEM WHERE IT HURTS. Jsyk, it doesn't hurt them all that much.  Fact of the matter is, by basic statistics, about half of you don't know who your state representatives are, don't know what district you're in congressionally and also don't understand domestic/foreign politics. You claim that they're all corrupt, but who is exactly? is it suddenly news to you that Hedge Funds conduct illegal actions? Is it really news suddenly that the media is lying constantly? Is it REALLY A SHOCK that all of a sudden congressional leaders are acting corrupt?  If you were all really conducting a revolution based on these premises, your revolution should've started long ago, around 2010.  Now that you've all put yourself in a position where the corruption is affecting you personally in a sensory verifiable way (losing all your damn money on a meme stock and looking at the RH line graph), you're all suddenly political and social warriors when you should've been long ago.     WSB is not a movement! WSB is not a revolution! we just like to gamble!

You are an idiot, if you are still holding GME
To all of your loss porn and posts about holding. You are all idiots. The company does not care about you, nobody cares that you're losing your money. At the end of the day, the big hedge funds are happy to see you lose your money.  That means there is more money in their pocket. So go ahead and keep holding, your shares will be virtually worthless very shortly. The stock is not coming back. Unless for some reason a huge rally happens, which it wont.  You guys ever think about the fact that all of the intelligent or educated people who were shitposting about holding gme stock, have all suddenly disappeared after the $400 mark? That's because they took their money and ran. The rest of you idiots bag holding, and listening to other idiots who are bag holding deserve to lose it all.  Good luck on food s , and thanks for the money,  I used to make 20k a year working. Sold my car and accumulated 73 contracts puts in the $260-305 range Just let that sink in. And i still havent collected. I will give you all until the stock hits $50, and then I'm taking my money. All   Fuckin retards.
Legit Question About $GME
Clearly the stock is going lower and lower. I think a lot of us need clear answers when it comes to what we are going to do. The stock has continued to go down which has   our spirits undoubtedly. We all are going through tough losses. Before it goes down any further, do we hold until tomorrow? Or do we continue to hold until Short Interest report comes out 2/12? Would love to hear some of you guys inputs. Good day and keep your heads up please.
Sold
Sold at a loss for 12,000 American, since it was all my savings I decided to save some and walk away with 8,000. This has been a hellish roller coaster, I pray for all of you experiencing big losses.
THIS ENDS ONE OF TWO WAYS - I"M FINE WITH EITHER ONE
To state the obvious, outside of all the hype I see two ways this eventually plays out...    1   The theory that tons of shorts exist is somehow off base and nothing ever materializes for the retail investor.  In this scenario:    RH is  still  finished    Citadel walks away with a black eye and hefty fines   SEC is left with little choice than to update their rule book going forward.   WSB lives on and its members post their YOLO losses, like so many times before and say 'Hey, we're retards. Who ever told you otherwise?'   WSB membership has a drop off that looks like a Short Ladder attack and we can all do some analytics on how many shill accounts get created when social media buzz fever catches.    I'm totally OK with this outcome. No one ever claimed this was /r/investing      2   It turns out that the Retards, Autists and Apes here were in fact   NOT  mistaken. They call the bluff on both the hedge funds and media outlets that do nothing but spew FUD. Wait at long as it long as it takes and many cash out big while others miss the mark in various ways.  In this scenario:   RH is  still  finished    Citadel walks away with a black eye and hefty fines   SEC is left with little choice than to update their rule book going forward. [This time tipping the scales so that retail investors have to find different approaches]    Your parents are pissed at you for not doing a better job at explaining the opportunity at the time. They'll get over it.   Your aunt Karen is pissed at you. She's not going to get over it b/c she's not seeing any of your F'ing money anyhow.   Your wife's boyfriend is pissed off b/c you told him he can keep her and he has no clue what to do now.   Your neighbors file a complaint that your super car is TOO LOUD (and that you don't actually drive it but just enjoy Revving it in the driveway  Lastly, what I REALLY come to reddit for is actually to see people get goal for being way more inventive and witty than I will ever be. As much as I enjoy typing this out it's really your comments that keep things here interesting.
A letter to each of you who bought GME, AMC, NOK, BB.
Dear WSB degenerates,   Can I be honest, I feel so broken and disgusted these days. I knew hedge funds was cruel but whatever they had done to the targeted tickers was obviously illegal. Yet every rich ass billionaire cahoot with them (banks, exchanges etc).   What‚Äôs wrong with normal average us earning and being rich? We are humans too, we shouldn‚Äôt be treated differently. One week of insane moments, media were against us, exchanges ban us, those tickers were halt at least a thousand time.   Why are we wrong? Just because we aren‚Äôt as rich as the hedge funds? Is not our fault that we were not rich, you guys didn‚Äôt give us a chance to prove our worth. You guys play dirty.   Thank you everyone who held GME, AMC, BB, NOK. I‚Äôm thankful that you guys tried and still holding. I‚Äôm truly thankful and touched by each and everyone of you.   To better days ahead.
Why you should consider holding
Chances are the stock won‚Äôt sky rocket whatsoever. But ask yourself if it‚Äôs more prideful, or even smart to get out now. I feel like number of GME shares worth more than what you‚Äôre gonna get now. Especially with all the changes GameStop did. New hirings etc, Personally I‚Äôll hold because it makes more sense to do so.  This isn‚Äôt financial advise so pls don‚Äôt take anything I say as is.
Stop checking the price every 5 minutes, if you're going to hold, hold. If you want to check the price, drink a cup of water and do 10 push ups before each check.
Checking constantly and fretting will not be good for your mental health. This happens. Most people told you this could happen. Yes it's anxiety inducing. If you can't afford to lose more sell it now. Maybe put a limit buy order in for something lower. Don't risk your savings.  Meanwhile, if you can't take your eyes off the ticker, which will drive you mad if you can't take the loss, force yourself to take a deep breath, drink some water, and do like 10 pushups before you check the price again. Blow off some steam and take care of your physical health at the same time.
Look at the bright side, at least the noobies now really understand what a GUH is
What better way to learn about WSB culture than your very own GUH!??!? Welcome to the ship, autists

MAJOR Issue with Robinhood account transfer to TD Ameritrade.
Hello everyone. I am super stressed out, and wanted to get this out to see if anyone is experiencing the same issue.   January 28 was the date where Robinhood started to restrict sales for GME, AMC, and others. I was holding GME, AMC, and BB, and sold them all before the crash later that day. Paper hands, yeah yeah, but I'm not made of money.  I shared the universal frustration towards Robinhood that the entire internet felt that day and since, and decided to transfer my entire account from Robinhood to TD Ameritrade. I sold the meme stocks, but was still holding my long-terms. I went to TD Ameritrade and submitted the transfer.  About a week passes, and I wake up this morning to check if my transfer was completed. Robinhood FUCKING transfered GME, BB, and AMC to my TD AMERITRADE ACCOUNT AFTER I HAD SOLD THEM! And my transfer was only half completed as well. There was also a negative cash balance of $1000 in my TD Ameritrade account.  On the Robinhood side of things, I had negative shares(yes, negative shares) of all the meme stocks in my portfolio. All of a sudden, around 10:30 the negative shares disappeared and Robinhood RE BOUGHT the shares on my behalf to cancel the negative shares out even though my account was still technically "deactivated". Now, I have a negative buying power of $-500 in Robinhood, along with the $-1000 in TD.   I called TD Ameritrade(Where you can actually speak to a real person.., unlike Robinhood) and they said that this was entirely Robinhood's error. The woman I spoke to said she has seen thousands of Robinhood transfers get fucked up because of their doing, and that I have to go to RH's support to resolve it. The only problem is Robinhood's support is incompetent and will probably take days to email me back.   I just wanted to post this for two reasons. The first is to see if anyone else has experienced this, and the second is to serve as a PSA of NOT to transfer your account from RH to anywhere. Liquidate your stocks into cash, fund your bank, then fund your new brokerage. It's what I should've done, now I need to either wait till RH resolves this shit or lawyer up.  Fuck.

Do you think we lost? I lost my motivation slowly..
Hello guys,  i bought almost at the top of 330 dollar. Down to 60. Im holding but i dont think there is a chance of the stock to go up again. The squeze has been probably squezen and we hold the bag?     i dont want to demotivate anyone this is just my opinion
Thoughts opinions?
Is the fact that these charts continue to be damn near identical a sign to NOT sell GME AMC? I know a lot of you are losing faith but I‚Äôm 65% down. Not a big investment but still funds that I would of loved to see continue to help the cause. I know it‚Äôs never a sure thing and you aren‚Äôt a financial advisor but please give your opinions on the DATA- NOT on if you think it‚Äôs over or not. Holding forever
I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. I like the stock
Some honest thoughts to the boysn' girls of this subred.
Ever since the value drop, I've been noticing one thing:People don't know what they want to achive here.  Are you here to earn a quick buck? Are you here to stick it up to Hedgefunds? I don't know, neither do I care. It's your cash, feel free to use it the way you see fit. But before you do anything, ask yourself why you are doing it.  If you are one of the bloody retards like me, who's in it to stick it to the edgy-hedgys, then keep your bloody cool about loosing money. We didn't came here to dance on their burning houses but to make a statement. And what ever comes out of it, Hedgefunds learned their lesson. We gave them a taste of their mortality since they believed themselves immortal. For me, it was from the very moment about this thing. If its Ferrari or Foods , I don't care. If you are here for the same reason: GRAB YOUR WIFES BOYFRIENDS HAND AND HOLD!  Are you here to make a quick dime? Then bad news, you are way out of your league here. So am I, by the way, if I'd be here to make money. You will need a shitload of research to make it in this business and even then, you might see your stocks head on a pike someday because safety is  the last thing wall-street is offering. If you are a    , then fuck right off. Sell what you have because neither the revolution nor the corpus is for you. Save what ever you have and be gone.    But do me one favor:   Don't go around telling people to save themselves, to sell, to jump shit. No matter how retarded we may be, we stand together, dick in hands, red numbers slapping our faces with taunting big red minuses but we agreed to stand each other, even if we loose everything. Don't take this moment of camaraderie and retard-hood away or spoil it. We stood together, we fought together and we may     who knows what. But what ever we did, we weren't pitiful about it.  To all my apes, no matter what the next days might bring, this was and still is one hell of a ride and I couldn't imagine a wilder and better community to have the ride with!  PS: No advice, not an expert, just a humble reddit-user with some bad eyes and ferocious and raging erections.
Retarded question below, I warned you.
I‚Äôm not economically stable enough to post a massive loss porn post so, is it worth holding till Monday or even later or will it never go up? My hands are so fucking heavy with all this loss that I‚Äôve accumulated I‚Äôm trying my best to hold ü§≤üèº
Serious question. Should we expect a steady decline in GME stock price until 2/9/2021 when short % is revealed? Obviously, on this date GME either sinks further down probably hitting 20-30s (if we haven‚Äôt hit that by then already) or shoot up 100+.
Thanks for your insight!
Let‚Äôs pretend we‚Äôre 20 years in the future looking at this graph.... this looks like the squeeze already happened. Is it possible it was as big as the 2008 Volkswagen squeeze because there were so many s rocks involved this time? Sigh... imma hold but... I‚Äôm burnt out
FYI, 2008 Volkswagen nearly hit its original value before taking off. HOLD!

We got played
Pre-face: not hear to rain in anyone‚Äôs parade. Hold your stock, buy more I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so who knows what‚Äôs going to happen.   However, I think we got played, specifically by those in the sector who said they had ‚Äúour back and we‚Äôre sticking up for us‚Äù  Think about the stock. Week of jan 22 it‚Äôs around $50. Hype builds like crazy. Then volume for nuts.   Yes WSB had a lot of people buying but now we are hearing about all these other Hedgefunds who made hundreds of millions off of this.   Then look at the price, $50 hype builds. It shoots up to $400 then dives hard, then shoots up again then restrictions.   What happened? HFS saw the hype and bought in massively. Drove the price up. At peak they sell. We see a massive dip, we go wow! BUY! Those HFS who just sold also recognize there will be another momentum peak so they also re buy. Then Melvin and co shit their pants and do their fuckery, al these other HFs hear this info in the inside so again dump, they dump hard. Dives the stock again, and now we can no longer buy due to restrictions.   They throttle the stock, the rich stay rich and now Melvin will just do ladders until they tank the stock to where they don‚Äôt lose their ass.   Meanwhile they got us holding like idiots.   I‚Äôm still holding both AMC and GME, counting it as a loss.

Stock Tracking App
Switched out of Robinhood, for obvious reasons, to Fidelity.  I find the phone app a little clunky.  Is there a secondary app or application you all like for consolidating watch lists and real time tickers?
The fake news attack on Monday is why I‚Äôm HOLDING GME
I don‚Äôt know about short ladders, I don‚Äôt know about squeezes but what I do know is that there was a massive fake news attack that happened this week. There was a reason why millions were spent on a media blitz falsely claiming we were investing in silver and looking at other stocks.   If GME was worthless, if the shorts already sold, if they couldn‚Äôt care less about it or us then why the massive effort to divert attention from the stock and to drive the price down.   The media blitz happened on the Monday after the GME surge. If the shorts exited on Friday then why the effort on Monday to drive the stock down?  Why is RH slowly allowing more people to buy more shares this late in the week? I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre hoping you lost interest, are discouraged by the dip and won‚Äôt buy.   I don‚Äôt know shit about stocks but what I do know is that I don‚Äôt care about things that don‚Äôt have an impact on me. I wouldn‚Äôt care about an anthill being destroyed in Africa unless I lived in it. So why would a hedge fund care about the price of GME if they already exited?  It was no coincidence that the guys who owned a billion in silver launched a false   that Reddit was suddenly investing in it. They needed more money for something. Maybe it was to cover their losses if they already exited but then there wouldn‚Äôt be a massive media blitz to drive the stock of GME down after the fact.   I‚Äôm holding. I just like the stock.

Robinhood sold shares without my consent. Anyone else?
Like many of you I've been paying attention to the stock today only to find a notification on my phone saying that my paltry 1 share of GME and 5 shares of AMC have been sold. I bought in my GME at 312 so this is very disappointing for me.. I have already contacted support. Do I have any recourse?
This will likely get buried, but please don't ruin this sub
I saw a top post today that rubbed me the wrong way. It was telling people not to sell and to buy more.   I understand that there are millions of new people on here, and many think this is some sort of pump and dump site. We should not be advising people how to spend their money. Instead we should be giving insight into our thoughts on a stock and allowing them to make their own decisions.   The GME push was founded on legitimate DD that found the flaw in the death star. It's very possible the squeeze is still on. It's also plausible it has run its course. Please state your argument for either side, and leave it at that.   We have already given WS a black eye. If you think this is a losing bet and want to continue to protest-- flood the streets of WS, write your congressman, be relentless towards the SEC about manipulation.   This sub is about top tier memes, shitposts, loss porn, YOLOs, and the unicorn quality DD. Not pressuring people into making decisions.  Disclosure: 20 shares GME @190. Not selling.

Don't just hold.... Buy too
We need to keep buying to pump the price. Holding isn't enough
What did we learn about the SEC from GME?
Disclosure: not a bot, not a financial expert, and definitely retarded.  I‚Äôm curious what you autists think about the SEC?  As an aspiring CPA, before all of this I held the SEC in high regard and respected its authority. Today, I do not think I can hold the same beliefs. If DFV has any action taken against him, and if the investigation into the hedge fund short ladder attacks/certificate fraud on shares issues do not get drilled into, I will lose all faith in this organization.   I‚Äôm starting to picture the SEC as spineless bean counters/analysts at this point, and the douche hedges are dragging their nuts across their faces.
Fuck this guy

Still holding here. Not as big of a loss as some but I‚Äôm holding until the moon.
FVRR?
The squeeze happened
Bought 27 shares right around $175. Was around for the excitement of $400+ and thought we could only go up. Then everything that could be against us was. I didn't grow up with money so this wasn't for me to stick it to WS. This was to make some money.  Then over the weekend all I could think about is how much I could help my family with these gainz. I sold Monday morning at $312. Now see where it's at, I'm so happy I did.   Respect to those holding. But this squeeze has been squozed.
Who am I to say this but doesn't it seem a bit odd that there is only 1 view on GME around here
Literally the only thing I'm seeing around here is posts about holding and how everything is being manipulated, with not a single post about any opposing view. What's to say that GME won just keep crashing until it hits $10 and the hedge funds win? It's just that there doesn't seem to be any solid evidence that we aren't all collectively being screwed into holding a forever dropping stock.
So heres a fun trick
Why is everyone selling GME?
Well?  Edit: wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if GME did the same thing twice?
Is everyone on board with leaving RH and switching to a brokerage that did not participate in the manipulation?
Seems like the only way to get some sort of justice here
Interesting...

RIP $GME. Cashed out at $83/share. Im back to my initial investment. Better late than never.

Just a bit of hope for AMC holders
Regardless of what happens now or in the short term, movie theaters will be back in business sooner rather than later. Before the pandemic hit, AMC was hovering around $9~$12 for months. Once movie theaters get the ok to fully open back up, I think there will be a major spike. Remember.. AMC is the  ‚Äôs biggest movie theater chain. Movie theaters will survive and so will we     I am not a financial advisor. I literally eat crayons and drink glue.

NOK Plays for 2021-02-04
So you're brand new to /r/wallstreetbets, you decided   $GME$   was a little too rich for your blood and you liked that   $NOK$   actually had some underlying value to support the price increase. Congratulations, you're slightly less retarded than half this sub and probably belong at /r/investing . You're already balls deep on calls/stock pickups, the price went down this morning after a positive earnings beat, and you think you're holding a loser.  Chill the fuck out.    $NOK$   prior to 2021-01-22 was trading FAIRLY flat for the last year with price averages between   $    &   $    (With some larger swings). What happened? Hype. Price shot up to $ , share buying was blocked, and paper hands took their tendies and ran.  So you're sitting here holding stock that's worth less than half of what you paid for it. What now? Dilute your shares and buy the dip. We've seen heavy support at the   $    price target today and price swings up from this point. Set your limit order at this price and buy as much as you can afford. Is this proof you have a gambling problem? Probably.  Will the price ever go back up? Of course it will. Price targets for this stock are fairly consistently above current market price. While the entire market is retarded, you can't beat good fundamentals/  This is   a rough 50% lift   from current prices.    TLDR:        Pick up   $NOK$   cheap on the dips (my re-entry has been at the $  support point but pre-hype prices   ~$   )      Dilute your holdings if you're underwater (just keep pumping in money)      Chill out and watch the market capitalization this year       Positions:        4,424 Shares @ $       7,865 Shares @ $

Retards and autists alike, I know morale has been low recently. We are being cheated out of our gains once again by big money. Fear not, I know many of you have just recently hopped on the GME train, but as someone who has been in this stonk for months, it moves like a MOTHERFUCKER. Within 2 days of buying my shares I was down about 40% (shoutout the u/jeffamazon post for the GME OGs)     GME moves erratically and I've honestly gotten used to the violent ups followed by the violent downs. Suck it up and hold the fucking line!!!   The stock market is "the transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient" -Barren Wuffet.   Don't be the impatient retard, its only a loss if you sell!!!   This is far from over, buckle up, double down, whatever you gotta do, don't you fold. You can bet your ass these low prices are enticing to big money, idk about you guys but I didn't hear no bell.  I love and respect every single one of you diamond handed c , we will be rewarded in the end. Stay strong brethren, many good things coming to GME gang.  Obligatory: I am not a financial advisor but I can advise you which colored crayons taste the best.   Positions: 155 shares   AVG (insert rocket emoji)

Here‚Äôs a story of someone who bought $GME at $15. In 1999. And the play was HOLD, because she didn‚Äôt really care. She finally sold in last week‚Äôs bubble and way before it popped. But, she didn‚Äôt care that much.
The moral of the story is Brooke Gladstone knew how to H O L D.  Starts at 00:00. Listen to the whole thing... On The Media is boomer stuff, sure, but has been rad as hell for a long time.  The story is a week old so, dated in WSB terms. And it probably pissed off a lot of WSB.  Props to u/superguy12 who posted when it happened

No amount of money lost or gained can give you this kind of hands on experience.
I know people who took multi year college courses in finance that have jumped on board this hype. In 1-2 weeks, we've all learned FAR more than any school will ever teach you. And it's interest free, with infinite potential to pay itself back. I tossed 17-18k in on the way up between $97-104.

BOOOOOOY LET ME TELL YA. If this short report comes back and they are still at over 100%, I‚Äôm going to spam WSB harder than these bots ever could to make fun of everyone posting this pessimistic nonsense. AND I CAN POST MEMEs NOW?!?! Good lord. None of y‚Äôall really know what is going on, and your attitude says you should‚Äôve never been here to begin with  I‚Äôm still  ü§≤ hard as fuck, losing my ass out there for sure, but honestly I‚Äôm having a blast lol. Couldn‚Äôt think of a better cause to throw it away for anyways
NEED HELP PLEASE. I apparently owe a MARGIN DEBT to RobinHood but it does not say in my account. Is anyone experiencing this issue?
I am trying to transfer my assets from RobinHood to a different brokerage. My brokerage says they could not complete the transfer because I owe a margin debt to RobinHood. Yet no where in my Robinhood account does it show that I owe a debt to RobinHood. I don't have a Gold account with them which allows margins. Nothing in my transaction history indicates that I borrowed money.   Does anyone have any idea of why this could be happening? Not even RobinHood notified me, nor does my account show any type of debt.
Still going to hold GME
I‚Äôm at a $3000 loss and honestly I don‚Äôt care much. I trust the moves GameStop is making and like the stock. This was never a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù for me. This is a long term investment because I see GameStop reinventing itself.    Here for the long haul.      for life.
GME APES ARE STONG. KEEP HOLDING THE LINE.
When‚Äôs this rocket ?
Oh Nokia, You Are My First Loss Porns...
Is there a good app for buying in Colombia?
I want to go yolo but I need a good app, and I‚Äôm at Colombia any suggestions. Thank you
These are the times that try apes souls
The summer investor and the sunshine paper-hand portnoy will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their fellow apes; but those that stand by it now, deserves the love and thanks of normies and retards alike.   Hedgies, like hell, are not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as TENDIES should not be highly rated.
fuck this
fuck
We lost. We Bottled it.
The boomers have won. still holding but just for the false retard hope. we bottled it.
Well it appears NOK has has lost its directions to the moon, and PFE was riding shotgun. So now we wait. Neither were, or are, going to the moon, but the troposphere would work.
Any ideas on Pinterest?
The earnings report is due
I may have     but let's continue to pass along tendies to those who need it most
Just Added 8 More AMC Shares
Just bought 8 more AMC shares!  BUY AND HOLD F CKING RETARDS!
AYO WHERE MY $BB HOLDERS AT
times are tough but hold the fucking line, we're all gonna fucking make it
I guess Square's Cash App has joined robinhood on the dark side

Rather than buying large amounts of GME, wouldn't it be better to keep buying small amounts of GME to push the price up?
Questions
So is now a good time to buy GME?
THIS IS WHAT I CAME HERE FOR LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOO
New ape - in at 250, staying for life. This is what I think about these dips.
Whose all riding that red wave hoping prophecies of a spike come true?
sixty dola
Hahaha
Panic buying=
Panicked?   Buy.      Nervous?   Buy.     Hate billionaires?   Buy.
Has anyone considered this possibility?
Maybe the hedge funds rather lose billions or even hundred billions dollar this time due to interest and keep the stock low forever than letting us win? That way we will never try to strike them again in the future.
I didn‚Äôt say give up on GME! We need to replicate it with another stock. What are your thoughts.
I‚Äôm not saying give up on GME... what I‚Äôm saying is let‚Äôs REPLICATE IT with another stock...
Hold vs Hard swallow
I could exit both AMC & GME now and keep maybe 5k from the 10k put in last week or ride it out for another week  2 sides of me are battling out in the head. Hold out for the razor thin chance of a bounce, or take the L gracefully  If I hold, maybe I get another shot at the moon Exit now, I'll have the capital to do my DD on a non meme stock and hopefully recover the loss in a year or two  Thanks for letting me think out loud
Be honest with yourself man
If you still think all these people are holding instead of just saying they're holding while secretly getting out, you're an idiot. Obviously people are selling off like crazy right now, look at the stock price. Don't be the last loser holding the bag.
Why GME and AMC are going down so hard? Is it time to sell? I don't understand anything
I've already lost half of what I invested. Should I sell to stop losing money? Are mother   ers selling and not telling anyone?
Hello wall street people
I saw an article saying this sub is being watched by people on wall street. If you are one of those people I would like to tell you to send me money.
APES ARE SMART.
DFV COULD HAVE CASHED OUT AT 46MILLION, BUT IS STILL HOLDING, THAT MEANS YOU CAN HOLD TOO.
sorry retards Robinhood killed the GME and AMC play
Robinhood colluded\ \  (well we don't know but most likely did) with hedge funds to limit the buys so the price bottoms on low volume. Eventually hedgefunds will cover and robinhood will lift the restriction on these stocks.  Switch from Robinhood to other brokers. To robinhood, you're the product and people that pay for your data are customers. they will take care of their customers in this case Citadel before you.
What would you use your GME gains on?
I had a little list in my phone for things I wanted to get if this stock took off and realized a lot of you probably did, too. I know a lot of people talked about ridding themselves of debt or putting a down payment on a house, but haven't heard much else besides that. I'm curious to see what you all were looking forward to.   Here's mine:  - a big fluffy koala onesie lol  - new glasses + eye exam  - a good, private health insurance for sister + mom, so they can get therapy  - dental work  - tutors for math + a language  - floating shelves for my books (all currently in boxes)  - a camcorder to practice film-making  - bribe money to watch skilled ppl do their thing and bother them with questions   - bribe money for ppl to help with creative projects/be my friend   - reinvest the rest with the goal of having a fund I can draw from throughout the years for things that are not essential, but would make life better
Serious question, is anyone who bought GME before Jan 25 still holding?
It seems like everyone who says they are still holding bought in above 300 so I'd like to know if there is anyone still holding from the 20-30$ mark?
No more being pussies let‚Äôs do it $GME
Ok so guys we are back with over 120% short on the stock according to Market Watch website.  The shares available for trade amount to 51 million shares.   We are   million retards here.  If each of us will buy 10 shares which is now for $650 dollars and hold and never sell till it hits $1k or even $2k we can beat them.    Just 10 shares each let‚Äôs make a pledge and support our brothers who even bought at a higher price!  If you just buy 10 shares all of us and take the pledge to hold this will never go down again!  Let‚Äôs do it !        Edit 1: why no more , Caz I‚Äôm sick and tired of everyone being against us. It‚Äôs not about GME it‚Äôs about life it‚Äôs about sticking it up and fighting back against the giants.  The media even keeps posting stuff like GME unwinding , or it‚Äôs all over.  It‚Äôs not over till WE collectively decide.  Take the pledge even post your position just ten shares !  Edit 2: just showing it‚Äôs about action and not just talk-
Combined loss of almost 82K
Still holding      This is not financial advice    Positions:
Its not over yet
We cant say its over just yet  why sell now when you've held this far? just wait a few more days until the 9th so we can truly see whats going on regarding short interest and where we stand in this fight  remember its only been three days and in that three days hedgefunds have thrown every market manipulation tactic they have at us  of course this isn't going to be easy, I know seeing so much red has alot of people anxious but it has to get far worse and difficult before it could ever be better, melvin is hardly going to go down without a fight  so for now just hold, hell even Cuban told us to just hold for the moment and deepfuckingvalue is still holding so if you don't want to take it from me take it from them and just hold, unleast until tuesday  \ \ THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, IM RETARDED AND SHOVE CRAYONS UP MY NOSE FOR FUN
I'm in boys
I'm a nobody. A loser. Some might even say a retard. I barely have any money but had enough saved up $100 to invest. I bought the dip at $  and my hands started to crystallize and glisten in the sunlight. Nothing can break them now. I'm doing my part, no matter how small. Now is a better time than ever to buy again.
Rest in peace you glorious autists
Seriously, love y'all. I think I had three heart attacks last week.   Moving forward, if y'all feel like sharing tendies or wasting more of your money, I'm a homeless college student.   So, spread some cheddar on me.   Godspeed retards.  Edit: you can tell who's lost money.
Mental health advice?
Anyone know of any helpful mental health subreddits talking about how to deal with the financial loss due to recent memes stocks ? Really feeling it today..
Hey  ‚Äôs over. Go home.
And for the newbs buying more GME or thinking about buying GME, you are catching a falling knife. Bring on the downvotes.
I TRUST YOU GUYS  üèª  ü§öüèª
I am retarded when it comes to stock so I have no idea what‚Äôs going on really, but I trust you autist retards with my mere 6 shares of GME. AND I‚ÄôLL HOLD TIL THE MOON AND PAST!!!!  Obviously no financial advise. I‚Äôm retarded.  I just really like video games.
You've got at least a month to wait. Put the phone down.
Hedges have to cover their options. You don't and shares don't expire.   Sitting there looking at your phone watching dips and peaks isn't helping unless you're looking to jump.   92 is higher than 90  Plus if you've got diamond hands, you'll scratch the screen.
With new   leadership and talks of Legalized cannabis, is this a smart play for long term profits?
The company Grow Generation (GRWG) is a supplier of all the equipment needed to grow and produce cannabis. At $55 a share it‚Äôs seems like a cheap long term play, so I went ahead a got in on some shares. With them being an obvious asset to the industry, are there other companies or stocks that are going be blowing up if/when it becomes federally legalized? Just seeing if anyone has some inside knowledge or experience with this market?
GME: What did we learn?
Obligatory:   Fuck off, SEC. I'm a username. Also, count the GME shares.   By now I think it's safe to assume that most people have sold their GME shares. Oh, I'm sure a few die-hards will jump in to tell me they're never selling, but 90% of us have moved on. That's fine.     did we learn?    --     THE GOOD       Shares, Not Options     Who would've thought, right? Oh, sure, a lot of us had a few options and made a killing off those, but the majority of the money made on GME was in shares. Obviously, the short squeeze potential drove that more than anything, but I think it's important to look at why else it worked.   GME brought in a LOT of new investors who know nothing about the market. I bet 99% of people don't know how to buy options or how they work. But anyone can buy shares. And buying shares probably saved a ton of us from buying FDs and blowing up our accounts early. So when GME was initially surging from $30 to $100, we kept buying shares instead of going for the home run.   I think that's something to keep in mind on any future plays. We all love our options, but shares were key to this for more than just the squeeze.     We Moved the Market     GameStop was obviously the big one, but AMC and Express were saved from bankruptcy. We brought attention to BlackBerry, which just needed a little bump and is a legitimate company. That's really cool. I love GameStop and going to the movies, and I'm glad we're not seeing more companies go under due to the virus.   We didn't do this all on our own, though. What we provided was that initial spark. Once the big guys saw what we were doing, they piled on. That's a good thing. It means they saw the same things we did, just not as early.     We Have the World's Attention     We dominated the world and financial news for about a week. They made jokes about us on SNL. Your grandparents know what wallstreetbets is now (a chat room, right?). The White House was monitoring the situation.   The whole world is now watching and waiting for us to decide which stock is the next big play. Even the worst DD posts now could send a stock skyrocketing because people will have severe FOMO from GME and the others.   All because we liked a stock and decided to buy it. Cool.     --     THE BAD       We Pissed People Off    Now, we do this all the time, but it's usually limited to each other and the real world never knows about it. We pissed off short sellers, hedge funds, the media, analysts, and the SEC.   You may think, who cares? Fuck 'em. And I agree, to an extent. But together they have the power to prevent us from doing anything like this ever again.   Oh, and they all lied about us, the stock, everything. Everyone. So expect that to continue.     People Lost Big    I know we love our loss porn, but there were people buying-in for the first time at like $400/share. Anyone doing this was taking enormous risk, especially when a lot of us got in when the price was in the teens and averaged up to the $40s.   If this was you, you learned an expensive lesson. Don't chase.            THE UGLY       Hivemind Got the Best of Us     At some point, around $300/share, we should've all taken a look at where we were at and re-assessed. I'm not blaming, because I'm guilty of it, too. We downvoted ANYONE who questioned why we weren't taking profits or had legitimate concerns about numbers that were coming out.  That's a real problem. And when the information started to turn against us (eg. the S3 short interest report), we should've known it was time to get out. Even if it was false, there were enough red flags by that point. This started out as a sure thing - 140% shorted, shorts extremely underwater, losing $, etc. Once that narrative started to shift, we risked the stock price tanking.     New DD Will be a Mess     Seriously. Take ANY new DD with a fucking gulp of salt, because the pumpers are coming. We made millions off of GME, and there's no doubt someone is out there just salivating at the thought of pumping up a shitty company in order to profit.   Now, more than ever, it's extremely important for you to pay attention to a poster's history and really do your own research on a company. If you're not comfortable holding shares for a long time, then don't buy the stock. I personally loved GME's potential, even without a short squeeze, due to their management and vision. My plan has always been to ride the squeeze to the top, then buy back in and hold it for years. Nothing about that has changed.   Oh, and do you want to know what the next short squeeze will be? I'll tell you right now:     NONE.       THERE ARE NO MORE SHORT SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITIES SO STOP FUCKING LOOKING FOR THEM.     If you see a post about the next short squeeze, just move on. It's not happening. Period.   You think things were bad before? Just. You. Wait.    --      TAKEAWAYS     The biggest takeaway for me has been how people changed their tactics when it came to GME in particular. Buying shares was key. That was the game changer.   Additionally, people with legitimate concerns with evidence to back them up should at least be heard. It's one thing to downvote a shitpost. Quite another to laugh at someone for suggesting there might be something we're all missing.   Remember when people laughed at DFV? Sometimes it's good to listen to contrary opinions.    --  Oh, on an unrelated note: GME shares are approaching my personal re-buy price of around $50/share. This is what I believe the stock's fair value is without any potential short squeeze. With Ryan Cohen's leadership, I think this company will have a nice turnaround. I wouldn't be surprised to see it legitimately trading at around $100-$150/share in the next year or so. Not a recommendation to buy, I just love this stock.
EVERYTHING‚ÄôS ON SALE RN, DON‚ÄôT TRIP.
Did everyone really think our meme stocks were just going straight into the stratosphere and we were all gonna walk away with 2 Lambos and a harem of dimes in a month without even trying? It‚Äôs going to take a little more work than that MFers!! It takes sweat, tears, fears, and balls of steel to reach those type of levels. NOW EVERYTHING IS ON DEEP DEEP DISCOUNT (in comparison to prior weeks) and people are running around crying foul, full of FUD and regret?   Once again, if you put yourself in a bad position bc you didn‚Äôt have the money to invest in extremely volatile stocks, I understand running for the hills. But damn... you might as well have gone to the casino and put all your money on black if you were just gonna sell at a loss when shit dropped 70%.   I‚Äôm buying everything as long as it‚Äôs ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and bringing my average prices down to minimal levels. Started with 18 GME @ $280. I‚Äôm aiming to turn that average into 200+ GME @ <$50 during the slump, however long it lasts. I‚Äôll sit on GME and AMC for years if necessary. Nothing worth having comes easy, it‚Äôs a fact of life. If you‚Äôre able to: KEEP BUYING, KEEP HOLDING, KEEP YOUR HEAD UP!!! You didn‚Äôt lose shit unless you sold.     - Fuck you Robinhood and your whore of a mother. You‚Äôll get yours, one way or another.
AMC hurt me
I‚Äôm -1k down on 657 shares of AMC. I feel like a paper back bitch. I‚Äôm still holding but damn it hurts. I want brrrrrrrr.
To all the people who are telling us, the people holding, we‚Äôre retarded
That was the entire point you fucking retard. For breakfast I had 7 soft-boiled yellow Crayola‚Äôs. We have been telling you all along. We are apes....  APES WHO ARE STRONG TOGETHER!!! GME TO THE MOONü§≤ ü§≤
Holding the line
I'm by no means, sticking it to the man, but I am holding my little 65 shares of AMC until the end.
KEEP HOLDING FELLOW RETARDS!
Remember! You don't lose money until you sell, once you let it go it's really done! HOLD. THE. LINE.
I'm new to this. Is TD Ameritrade a good app to use?
Me new ape. You older apes tell me if you like TD Ameritrade. Please. Thank you.  Edit: maybe I should say I'm learning to invest small amounts and I'm not asking specifically for GME or AMC.
Congress proposal
Someone should get Congress to pass the stimulus bill and send direct payments to Robinhood accounts . Thank you
GME IS OVER FOCUS ON ANOTHER STOCK..... WHATS NEXT
Here‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt understand, the whole GME situation is done. Many people have already made their money from it and as you can see it‚Äôs $61 now. So it‚Äôs time to focus on another stock.
What an expensive way to learn the stocks.

BB, Nokia,
For the little guy that jumped on the bandwagon with   there a long term goal for Naked, BB and Nokia? I've just watched my own personal funds drop by more than half on these and need a reason to hold I guess. Can't say I'm in it with diamond hands in any sense. Just looking to build a sweet cat house in the end   Did the hedgies win by pumping these to distract asshats like myself? Wife's boyfriend is not happy with me right now.
Just trying to figure out why the fuck I can‚Äôt post here
I‚Äôve seen so many errors that my account isn‚Äôt old enough or not enough karma. Bullshit. I‚Äôve posted here before and my account is not new by any means. I doubt this reaches the feed but lmk if I‚Äôm not the only one  ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[OC] I made a platform so we can all be in sync and chat in real time
I hope this is helpful for all of us.  Took me like 8 hours to make.   You can try it anonymously.       The realtime text (controlled by me) will be used so everyone is in sync, idk how it will work yet but you get the point. I expect the chat to become a clusterfuck, but the point is to have fun while on this journey together.  Eventually we can use it to be all in sync, and really fuck shit up in the stock market, but we'll take it one step at a time.  I just wanted to make a POC. Pretty sure this is illegal but fuck it.    Quite frankly, this is just my attempt at creating a backup in the case our communities are removed (given that    . Having anyone use this is kind of far fetched for me but hey, I thought I'd spend some time making something that could potentially be useful.    The stock tickers available are:  GME, AMC, NOK, BB   I cad add more on request.  Edit: Make sure to try the expand feature. I'll be on the chat with the üêï if you want to chat.  PS: I‚Äôm not done yet. I want to make a platform, a social machine gun, for all of us to mobilize and organize, and give us all the tools to fight Wall Street more efficiently.
WKHS??
This fall I bought 1 share of WKHS at   and 1 share of NKLA at    They‚Äôre both electric vehicle companies and right now NKLA is even and WKHS is up to 41 so I‚Äôm up 150% on it.  WKHS has been flying recently and out-earning most of these other electric vehicle companies, but I‚Äôm seriously considering doubling down and adding more shares because the stock has looked really good especially bc Biden said he wanted all federal vehicles to be electric and WKHS is rumored to be the new postal service trucks.   FYI still holding my gme and amc, but I‚Äôm really looking for some good news right now and I want to know if there‚Äôs anyone else who has WKHS or NKLA
Level the field
If these HFs are so inclined to get the Government involved we should push for lowering the buy in into these firms to 10k! Instead of a million. That way there is no elitist bullshit sentiment to these fuckers. That is why they are so hated it‚Äôs because the think they live above us.
Guys, the squeeze is over. 1000%.
$GME $4‚Äì>$483  Guys, think of it this way. If you say the squeeze hasn‚Äôt happened yet, gme went over 1000% percent. To put ina perspective, you try to squeeze a lemon 1000 times and tell me if there is any juice left. I know y‚Äôall want to diamond hands and hold strong. I‚Äôm not a fuckin bot, a bear or anything. I‚Äôm bullish. But you can‚Äôt squeeze GME $4‚Äî$483 and watch it go back to 60. If it had stayed around 250-300 it would have had a lot better of a chance. I‚Äôm not trying to be a party pooper   bear. But I just don‚Äôt want to see my fellow autistic retards lose money. If you believe in the stonk then    . God speed.
Does anyone know when GME is going to hit the moon?
Do we have an educated guess on then GME is going to take flight? 123 shares and holding
Question: I work for a company that has earnings call in 12 days, and is doing some big expansions that will drive share price up. I also know what price the CEO gets his bonus. Can I trade based on this information?
Am I allowed to share to others? This info is not secret within the company, and we have not been told we can't say anything, but has not been officially released to public.
$CLOV being held down by short options
I‚Äôve been watching clover health (CLOV) for a while now, and I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs being held down by short options when the company has major announcements and is going to be huge in the healthcare industry with their partnership with CVS pharmacy‚Äôs.   Is anyone else in on this, or am I the only one who sees the potential in this one
GME confidence post
I'm not a financial advisor, I sort through crayon packages for the cherry flavour.  Looking at the VW chart people keep floating around it's hard to tell the day to day scale but what people don't seem to notice is that VW is that after jumping up $398 the price tanked hard to $210 right before the squeeze. BUT! That was 8 straight days of losses before the squeeze happened (Oct 16th - 24th).  When the price started to rise it didn't hit its peak until another few days and it stayed there for a few days (Oct 27 - 31).  I know this isn't exactly like the VW squeeze and there are different variables at play but the timeframes still lend to my point... This shit takes time! Everyone expecting this all to happen without any ups and downs need to chill the fuck out. This is just as stressful to everyone but you beautiful bastards are holding the line!  Pos: 51 GME averaged @ $176   59 AMC averaged @$    tl;dr:     üå†
GME: Might be worth a punt at $60?
Right now $60 GME seems to be holding up pretty well.   I'm thinking it might be worth putting a little % of the portfolio on, Just in case there are shorts still to cover. I'm thinking they would cover EOW or before 9th Feb.  If it falls to $40 I'd lose 33% of a small %  = No big deal  If it pumps to $200+ = A few weeks of chikun tendies for relatively low risk
"ARISE!! ARISE RIDERS OF COHEN!!!" WallStreetBets: The Movie
Every big stuff begins in small. Like   small, but still! Just wanted to be a part of this thing.
So while we're holding GME and AMC with our compressed-carbon digits, here's a DD...
I've seen a lot of people talking about Cannabis stocks, so I wanted to volunteer a recommendation.   A month or so ago I did the research and found GrowGeneration (  it will have a sharp increase in value from industrial level hydro as well.
Can we go back to options
I lost $50,000 because i was bored, but i'm not mad, it showed me how evil America is  Please everyone at WSB, let's go back to options, that is where we made our money, the only way you can make money AMC and GME is to buy and sell every other day, let' say theaters open again and amc goes to 14 and we double our money, well we could make that in 30 days by buying facebook calls, stocks are for the long term, we want quick cash, options are the way
After spreading fake news that Reddit was all in on SLV financial news hacks are trying to hype oil
After spending half a week pretending that Reddit was all in on SLV, and trying to fake-pump that stock up, some financial news hacks are now proposing new shorts for Reddit to bust up. Here's an article proposing oil's the next big thing for retail traders:     So now we've entered the world of completely fabricated narratives about retail traders and Reddit, in particular.  What they don't know about oil stocks and Reddit is that young retail traders consider their stock buying to be actual investments in the world that they want to have in the future. They buy stocks that they like. They bought $GME, $TSLA and some of these other short-busting stocks, because they like the stocks.   Retail traders at Reddit like clean energy, new technology and the things that they like having in the world, like Gamestop. They don't like oil stocks.   So now we're in the world of financial news writers just making shit up and repeating each other's narratives in an echo chamber, trying to pump SLV, XLE or whatever next thing they can make a quick return on.  They're writing fake/misleading stories about Reddit for quick pump-and-dumps, like they did with SLV.
Buying AMC and Holding   üèø  üèø  üèø  üèø
Let's face it
There's retards (not in a good way) spamming hold and others saying its over.   Most likely it is over but if you haven't already gotten out and don't need the funds, then you might as well hold and see what happens.    This was going to Pluto but with all the manipulation and illegal bullshit that won't have any repercussions, the game has stopped.   HF win because you're poor and they're wealthy.      this isn't financial advice, I just used word prediction on my phone and this is what came out
Ain't no paper handed bitch. To the moon we go ü§≤
They are in this sub and smarter than we give credit.
Maybe I'm being a paranoid smooth brain but I suspect some of these "why is everyone faltering, we need to stick to it" posts are propaganda. What better way to convince people that the movement is over and get their message to the top then to pretend you want people to hold but that you see everyone failing?   Doubt everything, and when in doubt hold. I don't care what you're in. New or old GME. You've been longing BB or PLTR since before we had fresh blood or you joined NOK as fresh blood. The message is simple, if you're here you know it. HOLD. Paper handed bitches don't make history and the don't make tendies.    Ô∏è Ô∏èüñï
This sub went to shit
Fucking ban me, idk. People that threw their life savings at $300 a share are fucking mentally   is wrong with you.
Most traded stocks by location
Holding
Sideways movement and short sales
ELIRetarded     $GME; No short sales yesterday and we moved sideways, then short sales today we move down. What does that mean exactly??     And actually explain what it means and why
etrade continues holding my money hostage! makes it almost impossible to get my money OUT!! funds tied up for 3 days already and 6 more to come, not including weekends im sure!! FUCK ETRADE
Hype either dies or it come backs stronger than ever!
So I feel like GME lost all its hype due to people losing money, I don't think you should sell if u suffering from losses, but I think we should move on for a while. Let's start liking another stock for a whileüòâ, for example Blackberry and when people gets their hype and some money back we can come back to liking amc and gme with all might! What do you think guys?
Bought GME with student loans
I bought GME @315 this week. I did this with my entire months student loans. I'll be eating noodles for the whole of February. I'll never sell, diamond hands baby!   I just really like the stock, and love you autists‚ù§Ô∏è
If I covered the names, could you tell which one was which?
Everybody is talking about the movie deal. I wonder what they will call the porno version? U/deepthroatingvalue?
It's growing!  HOLD!
What happened to proof or ban?
Lots of people commenting pulling out or putting in, yet no proof. Edit: position   It was a bit hypocritical to not post it lol
To the guys who got out good.
Good for you, you payed $5-$20 for a stock and sold for 1000%'s gain. But, it 's really messed up if you told people to keep holding and put billboards up, convincing and manipulating, making memes to brainwash people, instilling false confidence in people to keep buying and holding after the squeeze already happened. That was dirty. If you did that, and are still doing that, you are trash. Yeh, the squeeze that should have really happened got stuffed by Robinhood, Citadel, Point72, and Melvin. And now the narrative will be that they were right to protect you from buying because look, it crashed. But somethings did come to light, including how much of these politicians and media are in these guys pockets. Here:
Goodbye Robinhood
Today I submitted my transfer request   out of Robinhood and into my Fidelity account. I've been with  Robinhood  since 2014 when they came out--It was so exclusive at the  time I even  had to sign up with a referral code from a buddy of mine.  They were my  first brokerage and I learned a lot along the way. But  that ends today.  After  that  bullshit they pulled last week its over. I stood by them  through their  past service outages, bad fill orders, and straight up  crashes at  crucial moments. I figured its ok, they are growing and  trying to keep  up with the big brokerages. I made excuses for them. But  the thing is,  they have always been a shitty brokerage. Those past fuck  ups were also  unacceptable, and the trading restrictions we saw recently  should be  the final nail in the coffin for them.  So long and fuck you, Robinhood. I'll pay your stupid transfer fee. And  as  soon as those shares hit my account, I won't look back.
Go donate to little kids you autist's.
Here's my loss SO FAR. More to come when it bottoms out.
AMC To the moon?
I currently hold AMC, a small 15 shares, but 15 shares nonetheless. I‚Äôm down $130, I‚Äôm still holding, but are we all now officially bagholders waiting for a post COVID world?
Here you go you loss fappers. Not much but my highest buy in account. Lol
I'm doing my part!!! DIAMOND HANDS TO THE MOOOON!!! (let me know if I used the wrong flair)
Green stocks: PLUG
Just seeing where everyone is at with Plug Power (PLUG). I think it‚Äôs going to be huge and will continue to climb for the foreseeable future as we transition into green transportation now that Buttigieg is transportation secretary.  I invested a bit back in November and am planning on grabbing more when I have some more good news on it.
Just a friendly reminder that DFV said he won't post today, so don't freak out
Read his last post's title. It doesn't mean he's selling, it just means he's won't be posting, possibly for more than a day. Stay strong.

How I feel right now holding my 10 GME shares
Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets Founder Sells Life Story to Movie Producer
I don't understand what the end game was here? Did a handful of you guys make vast profits off the backs of the monkeys?
Saw it was on discount so I copped 40 shares
I can‚Äôt wait till this is over...
I joined the subreddit right when GME and AMC started going up. I‚Äôve read a lot into this and I actually want to learn how to trade stocks from people who actually give a fuck.
I hope someone buys 420 shares at 69, that would be nice.
I can't afford to, or I would do myself
IT‚ÄôS OVER PEOPLE
I‚Äôve been trying to post this all week but keep getting downvoted or banned from sub because nobody wants to face the music.   STOP telling people to buy more! STOP BUYING GME. You will only lose money! Can it go past $100   it happen anytime   NO.   I have 20 shares @ $225. I am a sucker too! But please stop encouraging people to spend their money. If this damn cult allowed free conversations and exchange we could have prevented people from buying any stocks this week.   Please - unless you are a millionaire who has money to throw   putting it into GME.

They‚Äôre lying again...
I put in $2000 at 115 a share. Lost so much.. I really feel like pulling. I need the money, somebody explain to me why this is going up?
The new sell wall
Help, I‚Äôm scared shitless and don‚Äôt know what to do
I‚Äôve seen a lot of back and forth with GME and AMC, so if anyone has some solid reasons to hold, please comment!
I bought above 200 and I am not fking sell, but there is one more important thing
I was pretty lucky cause I entered the market as a retail trader 7,8 years ago (who only buy stuff like spy, qqq, amazon etc), so I didn't really have any experiences with 2008 crisis. And I never thought the MM and hedge funds are problems cause they simply do not have much impact on my life.  This is actually the first time I really start to think seriously that something has to be done after seeing so many ugly stuff from the hedge fund side. Seriously, next time with senate/congress election, I will put his view on wall street regulation, trading regulation and SEC regulation in first place. I don't give a F if he/she is democrat or republican or independent. Something has to be done.  tl;dr: I am an ape, so next congress/senate election I will pick the one who protects my right as a retail trader.
FIRST SQUEEZE GME, AFTER THAT GO FOR AMC, ARE YOU RETARDED?
Holy shit, like 10 days ago this sub was only about "NOW WE SQUEEZE GME, THEN WE GO FOR BB". Any what is now? half of you autistic paperhand gay bears went for a fucking movie cinema stock, during the fuckin pandemic, are you rly that retarded?  WITHOUT GME SQUEEZE THERE WONT BE ANY AMC SQUEEZE EITHER!!! SO FUCKING HOLD GME AND BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!!  edit: forgot to mention, this is not financial advice, I eat crayons
Looks like new management is in town   can we talk about CCIV ?
WALLSTREET: APOCALYPSE
BB loss porn anyone? Its not much but hopefully someone can fap to it.
Sell your GME now before it goes to under $5
The short squeeze has been going on since last week, when all the retail platforms only allowed retail investors to only sell shares. Stop promoting ang giving people hope. We already lost so much and other people need to know to sell before it goes down to $5  At what point does this become delusional? You guys all pumping the stock while many people are losing their life savings. I hope WSB gets shut down, yall are toxic and a danger to American people.  It was fun and funny in the beginning but now its just sad. Its over, we lost.  We can't win VS billionaires and the government. It's over.  Continuing this false sense of hope are hurting the people. Yall are shifting from haha retard to straight up retards. Its a tough pill to swallow so man up, take your loses and move on.     Next week you will be wishing you sold at 60% loss than at a 95%. Your stubbornness isn't going to magically make the stock rebound. Be logical...
Loss porn. Just bought four more at sub-$65. Let's go retards!
Who else of all the dumbfucks bought amc? Retards together strong! Bring this bitch up!

To all the retards that are panicking,  Do you all realize that the squeeze is inevitable? It might not happen soon but it will happen. The shorts are trying to weather out this storm before they close their positions in the future.  Think about it like this, Gamestop appointed three new members to its management. Ryan Cohen is not fooling around.  Once Gamestop starts publishing good results and steady growth, the shorts have no other option than to close their positions. How are they going to continue shorting a company that keeps performing good? They can‚Äôt.  They are literally waiting for us to move on from GME so they can offload their positions in a more calm market at a more affordable price.  This might take days, but it‚Äôs gonna happen.
What?!?
Too hyped about gamestop.
I think it's being overwhelming recently with what's been going on and I think it's time to relax a little bit, because everyone is talking about it a lot and it's great that we are, just I believe it's a good idea to take a step back and relax to appreciate the other lil things in life.  I do appreciate gamestop for what it is and I hope we all understand that it's not just a "money wagon" but a valuable company for what it has provided for the public and its customers.   So what I'm saying is keep your shares, now let's stop and move on and appreciate the other things in life. Thank you for reading

We are losing battle but it‚Äôs not over yet
As the title pretty much says, we are losing ground fast. A lot of people are selling and that‚Äôs normal given the spike that GME has. Many people joined and bought expecting a spike any hour now. The truth is, spike won‚Äôt happen soon. HF probably shorted more, and got new positions which gave them more time for more paper hands to fold. However, this isn‚Äôt over. All we gotta do is wait for more dip, buy for cheaper and hold. This is going to take time, so don‚Äôt think that you‚Äôre buying GME to flip it for a quick buck. That won‚Äôt happen, what‚Äôs going on right is probably going to take some time. So strap in, and hold. GME to the
I‚Äôm not holding because of   üèæ
The only reason I‚Äôm holding on because I‚Äôm already at a huge loss why would I sell my shares for that I rather hold until the company dies!
Europe played its part!
HOLD, YOU FUCKING RETARDS
I swear to god, you paper-handed smooth-brains, HOLD. APES TOGETHER STRONG. WE LIKE THE STOCK
Please return to normal
All I see is "Hold, diamond hands, etc"  Can we return to original bets, imo GME is pretty done, some just want to save their asses because they bought high.  There is no "us vs them", everyone tries to make money. It's not an army.
WSB is dead
This place has become a cult  WSB has always fucking sucked, but it sucks even more than it ever did in the past  I feel sorry for you folks that got manipulated - I really do  This subreddit committed seppuku trying to find some higher purpose and fucked a ton of people in the process  Good job Reddit

rWSB is losing direction and becoming fractured. Remember Apes: alone weak, together strong (AMC proposal)
First, what do I mean by losing direction and becoming fractured. Before the whole GME explosion and influx of subscribers, there was pretty much one theme on the subreddit: make huge gains or go down trying.   When the GME proposal came up, everyone was pretty much in sync to make huge gains or go down trying.   Now the subreddit has been split by a variety of different  :  \- The OG WSB crew  \- The fresh first time investors looking to start big  \- New lurkers/spectators checking out the show  \- Seasoned investors looking to pick up the next big stock  \- Corporate accounts/bots looking to astro turf    You'd think that with more people, WSB would grow as a force, but the problem is so many people are split:    \- Some people are holding/buying GME for another explosion  \- Some people are holding/buying AMC, BB, NOK, etc.  \- Some people are selling because they CAN'T or SHOULDN'T be making any more losses (totally fine)  \- Some people are selling because they just want to go back to other stocks (totally fine)  \- Some assholes are selling/buying puts and then laughing at anyone buying/holding GME, BB, etc.    Whatever the "right" move is, I think it's important to remember and to let new people know that the core of the WSB has been and should continue to be: make huge gains or go down trying\     If you made money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then congrats! But if you made money and then came here to call others idiots, then get lost  If you lost money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then I'm sorry. But if you lost money and then came here to insult people who didn't/couldn't want to buy/hold, then get lost    Regardless of the Gamestop event, this sub has and will continue to make huge gains and huge losses. It happened last year during the pandemic. It happened two years ago with tech (AMD anyone). It WILL continue to happen. Embrace the swings and don't put others down    As for the proposal:   Before people, I'm not calling for people to sell GME. While I'm skeptical GME can rise to $300 again or sustain mid $60s, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong and screw the cheating hedge funds. So if you're holding/buying for those diamond hands, more power to you    What I am suggesting is that new/returning people on the subreddit look at investing in AMC.   I think focusing on AMC is the right call because:  \- The stock is pretty cheap in comparison to GME. It's simply easier to have everyone join in a mid $7 amc stock versus a mid $60 Gamestop stock. NO APE LEFT BEHIND  \- The stock does still have significant volatility to make huge swings. Compared to Nokia for example, AMC has the potential to rise significantly in a short amount of time  \- The company itself is on the upside and people are getting optimistic that the stock could naturally reach $20 long term without the help of this subreddit (theaters opening up, vaccine rollouts, etc.). Meanwhile, rallying people to Gamestop is a tough sell when Gamestop probably won't maintain $60+ value in the long term (again, happy to be wrong here)  \- It's received a bunch of coverage. It's simply easier to get people informed compared to some random stock  \- The argument could be made that there's still value to be made off of a short squeeze  In short,   I'm proposing AMC as a stock with potential to get everyone on the same page, but any low priced stock with potential would work (as long as the subreddit is united). We have a bunch of new people and attention now. Let's not waste it by tearing each other down or splitting into various factions      TLDR: in bold    \  It's important to note that you should always make huge gains or go down trying within reason. NEVER invest money that you are not prepared to lose. NEVER put yourself at risk of bankruptcy or depression

Don‚Äôt forget how much you have learned!
With shares dropping and palms getting sweaty it‚Äôs important to remind yourself of the lessons you have learned along the way.  I‚Äôm a new member of WSB. I jumped on board just as the hype-train was leaving the station. By now I have learned so much about how the market works. Knowledge that will be useful for the rest of my life.   I will keep investing, learning more. Becoming better. I will take risks sometimes and make safe bets where I can.  Was it an expensive lesson? Who knows...  I am still holding my GME and NOK shares like a sloth that found a comfortable branch. ‚úä   So, win or lose, take the valuable lessons learned and keep on going!
Vanguard implemented 1 week deposit time.
As the title says. Even if you go the route of creating a Vanguard account and depositing cash from your bank you won't be able to do anything for a week. Fidelity might be the only viable thing left if you want to get into the fray in a reasonable time. (Less than a week).
Looking forward to when people start getting back into BB
Its just laying there. I cant even do anything to it.

First time buying
I just bought AMC about an hour ago and I‚Äôve been checking it every 10 mins. Do you know when each share will be worth $10,000 so I can sell? Do you think it‚Äôll take more than a week? Maybe 2?  Thanks for your help

Curious about the outlook on this company. Looks like it just got on the market any thoughts?
Volume Matters more than Price you Dipshits. This is EZ.
You dumbasses think it‚Äôs as simple as ‚Äúbuy price go up sell price go down‚Äù but its not. There‚Äôs always the exact same number of buys and sells and it‚Äôs easier to move the price on low volume. Half the shares outstanding are held by you dipshits. The volume is low so its easier to fuck with the price. But the price doesnt actually matter.      ‚ÄúWhat do you mean the price doesnt matter? how dumb are you?‚Äù.      What matters is that Melvin still has to buy more shares than there ever are on the order book. Volume is low so eventually they‚Äôll be forced to fill every sell order no matter the price. You buy it for 50$ now and place a sell order at 50K$, Melvin has to buy it for 50K$ at some point.   Let me make this clear:   EVENTUALLY MELVIN HAS TO FILL EVERY SELL ORDER NO MATTER THE PRICE.   They HAVE to. It‚Äôs not a choice. There‚Äôs not enough volume for them not to. There‚Äôs not enough stock in circulation for them not to.      That‚Äôs the trick. You aren‚Äôt waiting for the ‚Äúprice go up‚Äù you‚Äôre waiting for Melvin to buy, which they have to, meanwhile you never have to sell. It‚Äôs like a staring contest where you get to keep your eyes closed while you opponent has to keep them open. Melvin has to blink, you can keep your eyes closed for longer.      So quit whining about the price and sit on your 50K$ sell order.
AMC - Why current price is a bargain?
Even without taking into account the short squeeze and what‚Äôs been going on lately. AMC price average should be around $15-20. Once the country starts opening up and Covid fades away, people ware going to want to do what they have been prevent of doing. There will be a great demand for movie theater as producers and actors have not released that many movies due to COVID.   Therefor I believe getting the shares at $7-8 is a bargain because it should easily get to $15 in a CONSERVATIVE input. NOW ADD THE SHORT SQUEEZE AND     üåï
